"The case was very nice for a week or two and then stretched so bad that my phones corners were constantly popping out of it. I had to pop the phone back into the case every time i took the phone out of my pocket. Also the more rubbery part of the case (the sides that stretched) yellowed a lot after just a couple of weeks of use. Could not return it to Amazon bc i didnt have the original box so I submitted a warranty claim on the Otterbox website. They asked for photos and said that my case might qualify for a replacement and i need to ship it back to them. They said that they couldn’t provide a shipping label but my shipping fee will be waived on their side. Liars. So i go and spend $30 on shipping it back, send them the receipt and they say they are not going to reimburse it now. Would not even give me a gift card for that amount. So i end up spending $80 on a bad quality product that i dont even have anymore. I ask them if they can at least send me a replacement in a different color so there is no yellowing problem to which they agree (they said they would make an “exception” for me). But then they ignore me for days. FedEx said that they received my package on Dec 9 but on Dec 19 Otterbox said that they dont have anything and they cannot track my package bc the tracking website didn’t work which of course it did. That was the last email I received from a human. On Dec 22 I received an automatically generated email that my package has been received (13 days after it actually arrived) and that was it. They have been ignoring my emails and not responding. $80 and a lot of my free time down the drain. I would not recommend doing business with them to anyone. I trusted their reputation and I should not have. This is the worst customer service experience i have ever had.",1
"This item looks good, the 2-in-1 separate filter line is useful, and installation was straightforward.Unfortunately after 18 months, the faucet started leaking from inside the metal housing. Even when the faucet was turned off, water would leak slowly from inside the housing, down the line, and dripped over a few days. It ended up ruining my cabinet and the drywall on the ceiling of the floor below.The manufacturer, Kraus, claims a ""lifetime limited warranty"", but within the warranty text, the faucet hardware is only covered from defects for 1 year and 5 years, with more limits. After 1 year, they will also charge you for shipping the defective item back to them.I understand that I should have read the warranty terms in more detail before purchasing the item. However, I didn't expect a kitchen faucet to fail within such a short time frame, given how expensive it was. I also take issue with companies that try extract shipping fees from their customers when their products are defective and under warranty.Since I wasn't interested in paying for shipping to have a defective item repaired, and no longer trusted the manufacturer, I asked about return options. The agent condescendingly answered, ""honey, we're the manufacturer, you'll have to call Amazon about that"" and abruptly ended the conversation.I understand that defective items will occur from time to time. However, I do expect that companies stand by their products and provide support for their customers when it happens. Unfortunately Kraus is not one of those companies and I had to go through Amazon to get help with this situation.I'm sure most people who have bought this product have a faucet that's working fine. However, in the off chance that you get a defective unit, just know that Kraus will not be helpful. You're better off buying from another company for the same price range.",1
The handles fell off the replacements,1
It’s not like the pictures. No metal thing to hang it on. Looks homemade.,1
"These candles were lovely until one totally died even after battery replacement. It won't work at all. These are way too expensive to only last 4 months. I turn them on about 3 times/week for an hour, not every day. Disappointing!",1
"Dollar stores have a better quality then this product, and 10 times cheaper.",1
Keyboard is cheap looks like a disco . Slow,1
POST beeps indicating corrupt bios. Returning.,1
"First boot, saw the windows logo, then BSOD. Couldn't get it to recover as it didn't have a recovery image installed. Couldn't boot safe mode, error stating couldn't install windows in safe mode. BSOD after BSOD after BSOD. Additionally, Amazon customer service was lacking in this experience.Returned for refund. Gotta love the new 30 days to refund on higher priced items like this. Maybe I can order one next month.",1
"ive had this pc for a good 3 and a half years already bout it to play games, but after realizing the hardware was 10+ years old i couldnt play nothing on it so i just used it for school work and ext. Out of the 3 and half years ive had it most of the time ive had it it was either not working at asurion getting fixed or on and not even being used cause itll crash every opportunity it gets. I really wished i refunded when i had the chance but i was to ignorant, after these 3 years ive seen plenty of videos on these pc scams and ext and you can get this exact same computer for a quarter of its price. dont get scammed just because it looks good and has LED lights this computer is literally useless. For 500$ you can find a computer wayy more advanced than this one and last way longer. im truly upset on this purchase its the worst of my life (i just got done paying it off)",1
"Several times it shut down with hardware erro4s and is not compatible with Windows 11. And I constantly have to unplug the keyboard and the mouse and plug them back in to get them to work. I have to do the same with my camera. The box looks great but what a crappy computer it is slower than DialUp they give you a little USB to plug into the computer to have Wi-Fi. It’s the same size as the USB square that comes out of your wireless mouse. What an awful experience from the very first week I bought this computer to the last right now. It is completely shut down I’m in the middle of a business everything I have is on this computer on the cloud to return which I don’t have access now , it’s just horrible . Look at the second picture behind my computer, you’ll notice that the only things that are plugged in are the monitors, keyboard and mouse. And if you look at the first picture, you’ll notice the errors card via storage device, such as an external USB drive, which we don’t have faulty hardware such as a hard drive or CD ROM, which apparently we do now just awful.",1
This computer was marketed as a new gaming computer and never worked at a level for gaming. After a year of trying to make it work we brought it to a professional and they said the components were 5-6 years old and we were better of buying a different computer vs trying to update/fix this one. Thanks for making a kids dream Christmas gift a complete lemon.,1
"This computer is garbage! Parts are from 2011. You'll spend more than what u bought it for to upgrade it to work for ur games! Do urself a favour, save ur money & DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER!",1
"I want a full refund of my money you can’t even use the internet without it lagging, can’t even load fortnite let alone play it got into one match with 4 fps with everything to the lowest I will not stop emailing until you have refunded me",1
"This PC was great to look at, and that's about it. The Wifi was terrible/damaged idk. We even used a third party wifi adapter and it was still awful. We have a 330mbs internet and all my other devices ran fast, so that wasn't the problem. Afterwards, it didn't detect my monitor. I ran it for a couple of minutes and nothing. It sounds like a jet engine while it's running as well. Over all, this PC is not worth the headache I went through. Save your money and look for another option.",1
"The monitor support bar didn't fit .. then once we rigged something together and set it up it kept restarting, wouldn't get past initial set up. DO BETTER !!!",1
The media could not be loaded. The pc and the monitor would not connect at all. The monitor would flash on and say no signal then turn off. The desktop itself from the moment of turning it on made that very loud motor boat sound. The advertised keyboard and mouse were not included a standard set was.I called support who advised they would try and connect me with a IT Person and that took over 30 mins. IT kept telling me to unplug it and plug it back in. Return support was not helpful either please don’t waste time or money on this!,1
Fine for the first few times that it was being used but now is laggy or completely shuts down. Only purchased in August of 2023 and it's now January 2024 so only had it for less than 5 months and it isn't even used heavily. Disappointing.,1
"product is very very bad packaged , LED not working with a very very very small electricity output cable . i literally had to get a power source 5CM beside it to make it fit and still LED not working",1
"This console was a brick the day it was released. As usual, Microsoft is years behind its competitors. I don’t even know why I was stupid enough to purchase one. The biggest issue is that in order to play games you purchased, you must constantly update them. That’s ridiculous. Why? It was working just fine. The other issue is that it continues to take up more and more space. I regret few things in life, but purchasing this junk has to be on the top. Save yourself some headache and buy a different system.",1
"I bought this ”refurbished” console in July, and it stopped turning on in November. This was sold as an “Amazon Refurbished” console. The customer support at Amazon told me they wouldn’t replace it, and they wouldn’t take a return on it. The “warranty is for 90 days,” and the console turned into a brick at 120 days, so there’s nothing that Amazon will do to stand behind their product. They told me to contact Microsoft for help. The warranty that Microsoft gives is from the original purchase date of the console. In my case the “Microsoft warranty” ended on Nov. 21st, and the console quit working on Nov. 25th. So lucky me the only thing I can do is pay Microsoft an additional $300 to get this console replaced. So because I’m one month outside of 90 days and 4 days past a warranty that started before I even owned the console I now own a $450 paper weight. And if I want the company to fix or replace it I get to own what will be a $750 console. All because I trusted Amazon to sell a working “refurbished” console.",1
I thought I’d give this a go seeing as it was Microsoft refurbished. Looked brand new when opened. Everything was great. Then while installing games and watching a movie it locked up. I rebooted and it would lock up then shut off. I reset it several times. Same issue. Safe to say the SSD failed. Spend the few extra dollars and buy new. Waste of time and money.,1
"Picked the referbished unit for the savings. Worth the price. Came with the full warranty. Controller looks new. Was the price of a used one on the local buy and sells, and has warranty. A no lose situation.Update, controller drift after 40 days. Amazon will not accept return and Microsoft will not warranty. DO NOT PURCHASE****",1
"I bought this as a gift and unfortunately was left extremely disappointed. The controller didn’t work, the console freezes during game play with almost every single game we tried and then one week later it will not turn on. Well, it turns on, but nothing will display on the TV other than the Xbox logo. Extremely disappointing and embarrassing given it was a gift. Seems that buying a new one may be worth the money if this is the best alternative. Returning asap and will be using the money toward a new console from a legitimate seller.",1
Product failed on second day. Returned!,1
"Package arrived early, which was nice, console turned on and worked fine, until it came to reading the discs. The console did not work any further than the home screen, super disappointing. And upon trying to clean the disc scanner, the console was customized so there is no access to this point of the hardware; a part allowing you to go further is missing and replaced with a custom piece that won’t move, meaning if it is broken, its broken. There’s no hope in repairing it yourself. Was looking forward to it but was let down",1
I understand this item was not going to be brand new. That said the quality is very poor. Rusted insides not refurbished at all. Does not power on. Oveall disappointed that they would even take someones money and be ok with sending this out.,1
"This phone was not usable on Straight Talk Wireless. Straight Talk informed me that the phone was locked and could not be used on their service until it was unlocked. This phone is listed as unlocked and usable on any service. I contacted Samsung because these are new phones, they had me do a factory reset on the phone and said that would fix the issue. This did nothing to fix the problem.",1
"UPDATE: After having this phone for months I have to say it's the biggest POS that I've ever had!! More glitches than I could list. I took 4 stars away because I'm so angry at all the glitches. Now I'm going to go back to my A10E, at least that was reliable!!I decided to wait to write a review because I was on the fence about keeping it or not. My previous phone was a Samsung A10E which is not a very heavy phone. The A15 is considerably heavier which I am (still) not very comfortable with. Comparing the 2 phones as far as memory is concerned is markedly different. The A10E has 32 gigs of internal memory. The A15 has 128 gigs of internal memory. Considering that I have alot of pics on my phone with several different albums, this makes the A15 a better product. The battery life is quite good. The appearance is beautiful. I purchased the light blue phone. I have a clear cover on my phone. This is my 4th Samsung cell phone. Samsung never disappoints with quality, durability and performance. I love the Samsung Smart Switch which makes moving your data from one phone to another fast and super easy. They don't provide a SIM card or micro SD card so you need to make sure to move your cards into your new phone. The software is similar to previous Samsung phone with a few tweaks. For example, to get a screen shot for the A15 you need to press both power and volume down button simultaneously. What makes the A15 different from any of my previous Samsungs is with the A15 you have to press each twice. There is a feature that would put a floating icon on your screen and open it and tap screenshot then you will get your screenshot. Now, what sold me on the A15 is a neat feature where, upon your approval, they will block all spam/scam phone calls. So no more annoying spam/scam calls!! It's a neat feature!! Like I said, I love Samsung phones!!",1
"How many apps do you think you have on your phone? 40? 50? how about your phone from 2 or 3 years ago? 15-20 tops? LOL ah, yes the days when we got excited to get a few free apps or games on our new phones... alas those days are OVER bro! get you a variation of the moto g device family. Out of the box, she is pretty amazing. I didn't have a single complaint really. Super fast, tons of storage, great camera, new updated apps, lots of customizing, etc. JUST WONDERFUL. After a few months it happened, the dreaded update in April I think it was, maybe March, I now have 400+ apps. (I will attach a pic, it shows 399, there have been about 30-40 more that have trickled in since the initial dump, which took about 5-7 days to finish up... and 75-80% are ""system apps"" (bloatware from any and every carrier in fact.... ALL. OF. THEM.) For example, a bluetooth app for t-mobile, & verizon, & sprint, & metro, && cricket. Before you say, ""just uninstall them and move on!"" - I did. I have. I've factory reset twice and they're just BUILT INTO THE phones disk memory. There simply is no ""delete"" them. Some of them, as duplicatory as they are, messing around with them can still brick up your jawn within a few clicks... and before you even start, you are not a dev... so chill, I mean neither am I... but you just stay out of that menu, that app, and that folder. Really, who knows why they name everything in tech sketchy stuff like ""com.sys.IM-WATCHING-YOU-PAM.000"" and ""<%real/secret/23-LISTENER999>... but anyways... JUST PROMISE ME, YOU WON'T GET INTO THAT APP, OR FOLDER.... okay?So Motorola should reimburse me for having to put myself through IT school to teach myself to operate on this phones guts and remove all these garbage apps manually to create the phone I thought I purchased. All you can do is force stop and disable them. Buuut I still feel like they are gathering data, bc, why wound't they be. Its not just this model either, my partner has the moto g stylus 5g and its even worse on theirs. the play store basically never gets a break from constant updates (and then theres the transferring of precious data to the mother ship)yeaaaa we also had to upgrade our home internet plan and router because of all this. We couldn't both use the wifi at the same time doing anything at all. it was crazy. allllllso the apps are gathering intense amounts of data and ALL WANT crazy permissions that have nothing to do with the app itself. like the calculator wants camera permissions... nuts. The sheer number of apps that require making system changes or having total device control... it was too much. I would almost ask for a refund, but from what I see these days most phones are leaning that direction, making money off our god given ones and zeros.... and then still try and look at us in the eyes while they sputter out the retail price of the next generation of your favorite device. can't even hold it down on a free case or something..THEN - - when you finally get a break from force quitting and removing permissions that, somehow keep TURNING BACK on... you might have a few minutes to enjoy a quick photoshoot. NOPE. the camera app it comes with stinks, it just soooo basic.. so then you think, oh, i'll download a cool camera app off play store... NOPE. theres a fricking governor on the camera. That makes it so NO 3rd party camera app will get full usage of ALL THE MEGA PIXELS YOU PAID YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY FOR (48 megs to be precise, which is overkill, but still, you will be lucky to get to use 10 or 12 MP!!)Seriously. And JUST as google starts conveniently implementing the awesome 2 step verification, and authentication keys.... JUST in time for you to have to answer to your wife about why you don't have as much info in your google takeout as she does... yikes... oh and squeeze on some more of that exact same conversation about your FB activity as well.. yaaaaay.So, let me get this straight... I now have to REMEMBER ALL MY UNIQUE PASSWORDS && double log in, && verify 3 ways, all to check a notification thats just a promotional email about the new apps GEWG will put out next week. AND then FINALLY the google security come forward to say they don't trust my log in (bc i've got a VPN) - - - (from guess who - G1 - duh!) and they really cant tell the difference between MY REAL actual login on my trusted device from what it must assume is a HAKKr logging in 3 states away. . . . . . E.V.E.R.Y. LOG - INNNN!at this point i am thinking about a jitterbug and some stress eating of sour worms to relax.but yeah the phones cool, other than that.",1
"This was my 2x trying Amazon Renewed. This time I purchased the LAST stated available 2023 described as ""In OEM box, Box shows wear from opening"". The Moto Razor Flip phone was described as ""Like new"". Immediately upon arrival w/o even opening the box I knew it was wrong as the package was far too light. I opened it & there was a Moto Razor w/obvious discoloration on the case from use + a CHIP in the bottom screen. Packaging was similar to a top end Samsung I ordered from Amazon Renewed & fulfilled by a 3rd Party in FL 2 years ago. I saved due to credit only $20 @ checkout over a NEW One. WORSE there's NO WAY to return this immediately (There' are 2 Amazon Return 2 locations within 2-5 minutes of my house. Just came back from one & CS stated ""I've never seen this"")). Instead Amazon MAY notify me when they'll ONLY pickup from my house in 3 days.I had this EXACT same problem with a $700+ Laptop that was supposed to be Brand New. I'm beyond a coder or tech guy & ran a battery cycle count software on that as the battery lasted 2 hours less than advertised. It was obviously a RETURN, re-sold as NEW, unless Compaq sells Laptops w/over 200 battery cycles already on them. Same thing w/2 PB's & a CH Android Tablet which still had the previous User's name & account information installed. Seriously, WHO is doing QC? I'll NEVER use Renewed again. Period. Even when you buy a NEW item it's 50/50 now you'll get someone else's return sold as New! eBay here I come again. Worst thing this was supposed to be a gift. OBVIOUS Screen CHIP really ticks me off. Since 2022 I'm now 2 for 8+ on purchases of tech devices. Buy with caution!",1
The system worked well for a few days .Then multiple issues launching any game arose.All games were bought new .Very aggravating.Not sure what to do now .I guess I just threw away money for a game console that barely works .Hope other people have better luck .Take care .,1
"Ever since I got this thing it’s been a source of frustration. It picks and chooses what games it allows me to play. Whenever I put a disk in it won’t read it, it’ll say open tray as of there isn’t even a dick inside. I have to open and close the tray 5+ times to get it to work. Sometimes it doesn’t. Some games it won’t play at all. I have a feeling that whoever inspected this thing before resale just looked it over and said “looks fine to me” and pushed it down the line. Piece of junk",1
"Not sure if I received a defective batch, but this set was horrible. All the “slimes” were sticky like glue and watery. Not useable. Waste of money.",1
"Well where do I begin? The tray door wasn't opening, handled that. It's not playing any of the games at all. This game system specifically said in good condition not seeing that at all. It's not even reading any of the games at all. So basically I just wasted $367 so I definitely feel like I have been scammed. This is so ridiculous. Ordered through Amazon I thought was a reliable place. Never had any problems before through them. So I figured why not? Well this is the absolute last time I'll be ordering anything that's refurbished or used. This is pure junk Xbox 360. Wasted my money and time. So thank you for that.....I hope this helps the next buyer plz beware of the scams.",1

"The media could not be loaded. Ok, I’m so confused. I didn’t open this for a couple weeks after getting it while I was finishing my last bottle. The seal on the bottle was intact. Unfortunately now I’m outside of my window to return.This was the worst experience ever. At first it was bright purple, for a few days. But even while purple… it felt clumpy and silicone-like.

It just breaks into smaller chunks and won’t stick to your teeth.I included a video of how it has turned brown and continues to stay that way no matter how much I pump out of it… looks like it’s oxidized?

I also didn't realize until I READ on the product info itself that the effects you might get if you're lucky will be for ""that day only""... purple cancels out yellow or something like that. This is a gimmick and was a complete and total waste of my good money. Can I get my money back? Please, I bought 2 bottles. I can send them both back one unopened.",1
The purple toothpaste does not dissolve (lather up). Good fall into sink from mouth while brushing.The purple color makes it appear whiter for a few moments only. Used for about 2 weeks. Waste,1
Don’t buy this buy Mint InstantPurple Color Corrector with nHAp. I haven’t bleached my teeth in a year since using that. I tried this to save money big mistake. This doesn’t even bring out the white at nothing. Plus the dispenser pull gadget inside became unhooked so it doesn’t work I have to shake the paste out after four days. Pure garbage.,1
I tried this product and can confirm that it does not preform as advertised. Day to day use did nothing to help improve the look of my teeth.If anyone has had any experience that was better than mine then great for you.,1
This product rendered useless as the product doesn’t pump out and there was no straw in the pump like most purple teeth whitening products in this category.,1
An explosion of toothpaste from every crevice but the one intended,1
It’s either very loose or just doesn’t fit. Trash.,1
I tried this product hoping it would do what it says. But I didn't notice any change at all. This was a waste of my money.,1
Received the tube- it felt liquid when I picked it up to use- so I shook it quite a bit. Opened a bunch of liquid squinted out everywhere. put cap back on and shock it- get a little bit of pasty white material like toothpaste. Has been ongoing issue- tube usually only squirts liquid so it does not stick to toothbrush. Can't return it. Waste of Money. Going to make m y own!,1
"This was our favorite toothpaste. Long lasting clean feeling and nice minty gel flavor. Since crest added the tarter protection (in very small print), the toothpaste is watery, no gel minty taste and doesn't clean as it did before. I bought Colgate for the first time ever. Just not the same.",1

"I was only able to use this product once and then it stopped working. It was great the one time I used it as it helped flush out my ear as I had an ear infection. I have charged it, the light turns from red to green and when I go to use it, it doesn't turn on.",1
"I purched this item along with some of the Pink Stuff, and did not use the brush before my return date expired. When I loaded the batteries it failed to turn on. OK, Pionk Stuff produce is good, so I order a second brush and when it arrived the packaging was damaged, but I tired it anyway just to see if this one worked. Same issue - unit would not start. Changed the batteries and it still would not start. Sending the 2nd one back for a replacement and will see how that works out. If it doesn't start I will just return it and look for another option. Obviously the manufacturing quality control is missing...",1
"I have used the attachment specifically to clean dirty grout in my tile floors and that was barely works. It comes with a lot of attachments for other types of cleaning I haven't tried them yet, but feels cheap...",1

"The product was good in concept, however, the head of the product keeps coming unscrewed from the pole, no matter how hard I tighten it. It doesn't get in the grooves very well. Seems like it would be great for someone it just need minor surface dust removed and does it on a very regular basis. But built up dust and dirt only gets moved around. Sad I spent the money in it. 😒",1
This product is AWFUL! It DOES NOT PEEL OFF easily or in one piece. I tried it last week and followed the instructions. It took my 45 minutes to peel tiny little pieces off before I just got in the shower to wash it all off. Last night I decided to give a second chance and left it on much longer this time allowing it to set. SAME issue. I was smarter this time though and did not spend all that time picking at it. It also made my skin much more irritated.,1

These do not work at all! I wish I did not have to give them any stars! I need anywhere between a .5 to 1.25 reader depending on whether I’m wearing my contacts or not so I was so excited to try these. I put them on and could not read ANYTHING! They were so blurry. I kept them on for a bit to see if they’d adjust and they never changed at all. They are going back and I am leaving this review so no else wastes their time or money on these.,1
"These are cheap, I guess you get what you pay for. They fit over glasses and do provide a view while laying flat. However it is very uncomfortable on your face and disorienting because of how the reflection is displayed, and I don't know if I just received a bad pair but the lenses were scratched. Also, they can't be returned, I don't know if there's a better option but this pair is not a good one.",1
"Too heavy to use,not good for Using laptop. It adds extra pain in your reading during lying in bed.",1
My lens fell out. Within my first minute of having it. The lens just fell out.,1
I got these for reading and they were so insanely heavy they caused a headache right away. I returned them.,1
We followed the instructions but this does not stick on with water as promised. Then when we went to return them we dicovered that the return window was only a month — since we weren’t going on vacation until next week we didn’t try putting them in and it expired by a week. :(,1
Feel cheaply made and a little heavy. Difficult to use if you wear glasses already. Have to lie way back or hold book way down at an odd angle to use well.,1
Poor quality didn’t expect much but didn’t expect this cheap. Like something you’d win at skee ball!,1
"The picture represents the glasses as is. i.e. The Bifocal piece is just that, a glued on bifocal. Too small. The sunglasses were very light and flimsy. Would not recommend.",1
I ordered these to better able to see my instruments while riding my motorcycle. They are hard for me to see anything through top or bottom. Not a good choice for me.,1
"The description of this product says ""Fits most glasses."" ON WHAT PLANET???Total waste of money.",1
"I have narrow eyeglasses and these sit in the top third of those lenses. They are basically unusable. The picture online doesn't show a correct image. I would guess it was placed with a distortion. It doesn't show how really narrow, top to bottom, these clip-ons really are. I don't know what to do with them. I guess I'm just out the money.",1
Make sure you know your range. I needed a higher range than what was advertised.,1
"Hinges break in two weeks ,they are very weak",1
Love the thought of the multi vision however the plastic lenses that I received were foggy and barely useful. It’s unfortunate as I did purchase a pair locally and had I not lost them… they were clear and functional.,1
It's a great item it's just that I can't use it with the lens scratched.,1
I don’t write reviews typically but these were pretty bad. Besides being scratched on one lense they were very poor quality. I paid much more than I usually do for a cheap pair of reading glasses and they were comically bad. Creaking plastic frames that were not angled correctly (too wide) when open so that I had to bring them back in to meet my head. Loose lenses that were not fit well to the frame. Not asking for much but for around $25 I expected them to at least be usable. Also suspect I’m not the first to return this pair.,1
"First it arrived much later than expected. It was just packed in a clear plastic bag, no cover at all. Then I went to open the arms to try them on and the hinge broke. Very disappointed. Had wanted to have a retro looking pair of reading glasses, I guess it wasn’t meant to be.",1
I bought two pairs and both broke from normal wear.No return option.Waste of money.Bad product!,1
Broke within a couple weeks of light use. Disposable quality.,1
"I bought these again because the side ear pieces stretched and I needed a new pair. Its been less than a year, and I ordered these again and the quality of the glass is horrible. DISTORTED! When I look down it makes me feel like Im 2 ft from the ground and I am not a toddler. Something really wrong with these.",1
Sorry but they don't work.,1
"The stems are somewhat short and the lens frame is a bit delicate (not surprising given the website photos and the fact that their wireframes), but the glasses are nice and lightweight. Unfortunately, the magnifying strength of the lens is a bit weak. I ordered a 2.0 lens and received them labelled at 2.0, but they seem closer to a 1.75, meaning they're a bit soft in terms of focus.",1
Disliked seeing fuzzy put over prescription glasses for the computer @ work I can see clear,1
"They do have lights. They are cute. But I got a book out in bed, which is why I wanted these, and put on these glasses to aide. I had to turn on light from iPhone to see the words. Hugely disappointed.",1
The attachment of the temple hinges is defective. I was replacing a broken pair I had for several years on which the hinges fit properly. Both replacement pairs have the same problem. I feel that these will break in a short period of time.I would recommend not ordering these glasses.,1
"I didn't like the glasses because it seems like the lens are inserted upside down! It is very difficult to see, I turned the glasses upside down on my face and now I can see close up!",1
The lenses and price on these glasses are awesome BUT I will not recommend as the frames break very easily when cleaning and I went through both pairs in 2 months so with that said I will never buy these again.,1
"Cheap packaging, arrived with right lens off",1
Avoid. The tag on the glasses marked them as defective store seconds. The lenses were scratched. To return them Amazon wants me to drive to a store many miles away.,1
"Worst readers that I have ever owned. Cheap frames designed to fit Shrek's head, so they fall off normal sized head, and optical quality is terrible. Don't waste your money.",1
"I'm not that gentle with eyewear, so should avoid plastic frames. Temple hinge broke off the rim.",1
These glasses are supposed to be adjusted for the user’s vision. The frames and lenses were cheaply made and I could not adjust them to improve my vision. Sent them back. Would not recommend anyone to purchase these glasses.,1
Do not waste your time and money on this expensive gimmick. IT'S WORTHLESS!!!,1
They're so poorly made it probably cost them less than $1 to make them. And look what they're selling them for! And they don't even work. Junk! Junk,1
"Not useful per any one need more 1.5 and only small face can use ,,,, very bad quality",1
Way too heavy,1
"Received April 30, 2023. Broke trying to put them on July 19, 2023. They have been carefully kept in the case. Never handled by children. The case has held up better. Would not recommend.",1
I liked the glasses but after 2 months the arm broke right near the screw where the metal part of the arm meets the plastic ear piece. So disappointed.,1
Product has a larger span than earlier 1001 versions and slips off constantly. Not a good fit and not comfortable. Not adjustable without breaking it.,1
Wrong reader strength!!!!,1
"I have worn prescription eyeglasses for years and have had to adjust the arm ‘width’ (slowly, gradually and carefully) many times. I also know when I cannot make the adjustment myself and require professional assistance. I attempted a minor single arm procedure on these so they would not slide forward when I lean forward. And they snapped at the left lens holding area where no adjustment was being attempted.The natural tortoise colour I selected is a quite handsome frame. Their magnification might be a tad more than their spec, but if so it seems to make them even better readers for me. You need to know that the round lens size is small, but John Lennon would probably have loved them. I enjoyed having them sitting quite comfortably towards the end of my nose to allow an easy switch from the TV to lap computer without missing a beat. Larger lens/frames would not allow for this wearing option so they have a distinct advantage for me. I have mentioned elsewhere I have come to regard reading glasses from Amazon as expendable throwaways. Since they cost so little and look so good, I just try to have an extra pair on hand. Usually something different to try. But that was when I got at least several months wear from them…not just a week or 2. I think I’m glad in any event that I only wear them to read at home, or after arrival at a destination requiring reading. I’m sure I would not want the obvious risks associated with a deploying airbag while wearing them. -max",1
The left glass has a blurred line inside it. In addition the size of the glasses was very small.,1
Broke at the hinge after less than two months of use - not even used daily. But the multipacks of readers. At least then you won’t be mad if you only paid $5 for something that breaks after two months,1
These glasses don't bend. I got them and the frames are warped. They slide off my nose if I look down. I will be returning these once I get back home from work this weekend,1
"#1 the photochromic affect is not dark enough for me, only a light gray. #2 the magnify area is way too narrow, requiring too much head turning. #3 the plastic is cheap, like dollar store stuff. #4 the hinge is not very springy.",1
Only used the glasses for less than a week when the nose pad fell off.,1
The glasses are not calibrated to the center to center of your eyes. The fact is that all folks eyes are not the same distance apart. This makes them blurry. Very lightweight and fit decent. Just don’t expect them to be perfect.,1
Do not show your and far you only get closer or far away does not do both,1
Does not correct vision,1
"This product does not work blury far blury near, request money back.",1
Blurry at a distance,1
"I ordered this DeLonghi 14,000 BTU air conditioner with UV-Carelight on August 11th 2021 and it cooled quickly in a 92 degree large open space. But, as you can see from the photo, it now sits outside with a cut cord waiting to go to the dump.In October I turned on the unit for its UV properties and it worked for a couple of days until the fan started to make a loud screeching sound. I unplugged the unit and called DeLonghi Customer Service (CS) who asked me to make a video of the fan noise so they could evaluate the problem. I could not duplicate the problem, so I didn't send the video assuming it had self-corrected..In June 2022 (after just a few days of AC use when I bought it) I set up the unit and turned on the air conditioner. The fan blew air, but the compressor never turned on and the unit went off and on at will. It blew hot air!I called customer service with the reasonable assumption that DeLonghi would send a new replacement. I provided a video and cut the cord as instructed since they don't retrieve broken air conditioners. However, although 100% on my side, CS said the Company's policy is to replace the unit with a reconditioned one that may or may not be the same color or have the same features, and whose warranty continues with the existing purchase.CS contacted his manager at my request for a new unit with new warranty because it was used less than a month, and the answer was ""no."" I asked him whether there was someone else who could evaluate the situation and that person said OK to a new unit, same as I bought, but warranty continues from original purchase date. There were no refurbished machines available. The CS and I agreed this is the best we could do so I compromised. CS said he would follow through so the process moves ASAP and I'm sure to get a new unit. Since DeLonghi doesn't accept returns of broken units I asked CS how they get the A/Cs for refurbishments. In the worst-possible consumer scenario, where do the refurbs come from?? Well, they're the ones that ""fall"" off the truck when being delivered and therefore not accepted by the customer. Dings and bangs. Yup!!WHAT???!!! I just spent $645 for this barely-used air conditioner (minus money Amazon reimbursed me to buy dust covers that were advertised [at the time] as included but neither Amazon CS nor I could convince DeLonghi to send them) and countless h-o-u-r-s searching Amazon for the right free-standing air conditioner to meet our needs.A week later I received a notice that the label was created for ""new"" AC from DeLonghi. At this writing, it's two weeks and no sign of shipment. By now, the temperature in the Great Room is close to 90 degrees. So...I call Amazon CS and within 20 minutes I've 'returned' the AC and received a refund so this week I will have a functional AC and maybe two for a second room. Amazon Customer Service Rocks! It may be the last vestige of Corporate customer service.",1
"I don't usually write reviews, but I'm doing this out of a sense of responsibility. These De'Longhi ACs have a major design flaw that will result in your floors being flooded and damaged. The worst part is, that De'Longhi is well aware of this problem and continues to ship the product.My photos here basically tell the story. These units are designed to literally sit on the plastic water tank. Instead of having a metal bottom with casters (and the tank inside the unit), the tank is directly at the bottom of the unit and the casters are attached to it. This results in a lot of pressure and stress on the plastic, mostly from the weight of the unit, but also due to how the plastic is attached internally.As you can see this results in the plastic cracking, which allows the water in the tank to pour out. These units produce a lot of condensation, and it only takes a few hours of running to flood your floors. I discovered this the hard way. We had so much water leak out of this tank that it drenched our carpet and the subfloor. It actually damaged our house, and we spent a week trying to dry the carpet and padding out. We probably have mold now as a result.These units are literally shipping out with this defect. It arrived at my home this way, but we didn't know because the crack was underneath. It wasn't until our floor had been soaked numerous times that we realized there was a major problem. By the time the crack was discovered, the damage had been done.This is not an isolated incident. If you read through the reviews here you'll see this is a common and known issue. In fact, when I contacted De'Longhi support about this it was obvious that they had many customers with the same problem. They shipped me out a replacement under the warranty, and guess what, it has the same problem!Look at the last two photos I've attached, and you'll see there are stress marks (white marks) in the plastic in the identical location of the unit that had the crack. This replacement unit has the same problem, and is a ticking time bomb waiting to crack in the same location.This is a stupid design flaw on an otherwise very nice unit. Why they are not making these with metal bottoms is beyond me. My guess is they are being very cheap about it. I have another De'Longhi AC from years ago, and it also has a plastic bottom. My guess is they are saving more money than they are losing from this issue.Dealing with De'Longhi support is a nightmare. You will spend at least 30-45 minutes on hold. When you finally get someone they will only offer a replacement. They will not refund under any circumstance. In my case they offered me a 4th unit and I laughed. I've had 3 defective units from De'Longhi. The first one shipped out with an assembly defect in the outer casing. The second one had the cracked bottom, and the third unit has the stress cracks in the same spot.By the time you realize you have an issue your only choice is to go through De'Longhi support. Amazon will not refund past 30 days. In my case I've had 4 months of replacements and no one will refund me, not De'Longhi or Amazon. I'm left with a unit that will likely split open at the bottom in a matter of days or weeks.De'Longhi does not care about their customers. I've spoken with them many times, and it is clear they only care about their bottom line. They are basically committing fraud here by shipping these units out with clear knowledge they crack and leak. They just don't care!They also have an absurd policy that requires you to cut the power cord on replaced units and send that photo to them in order for the warranty to be maintained on the replacement. This forces you to then pay to dispose of the defective unit. In my case I just glued the plastic bottom using a plastic epoxy and then sold the repaired unit. I just couldn't throw out a unit that was working perfectly except for the crack. What a waste that would be!If you do end up in my situation you can repair the cracked plastic by using J-B Weld PlasticWeld Super Strength Epoxy (sold by Ace Hardware). It will completely seal the crack and dries harder than the original plastic.Beyond that, I recommend staying away from De'Longhi and these AC units in particular (unless you prefer cracks and leaks).De'Longhi, shame on you for this!",1
Bought in late June. Worked great for the summer heat and also ran the heat a few times in the fall. Sound was not bad at all and everything worked great. Now it is late fall and AC and heat both don't work. Turns on and fan kicks in but no heat or cool air .I can't afford the hundreds of dollars it will take to send it back to be fixed. Very upset.,1
We had a previous one and it was great.Wanted a new one but lost in shipping so we canceled order.Daughter took old one when she moved out and that one still works great. It was three years old.,1
I should of listened to the reviews! Unit made loud noise then AC mode stopped working only Fans Work.... It didn't even last couple minutes. Defective batch were bought.,1
"There are a few glaring issues with this product1. The unit vibrates violently. If any tube/wheel/fan/vent is slightly out of place it will sound like a mid-sized motorcycle is revving inside your room. Every time I turn it on I have to press and lift various parts of the unit until I find out what is causing the noise before taping or angling it in a way that makes is quieter.2. The draining system is a massive design flaw. There are two separate compartments that hold water. The top compartment, which gathers water in the ""dehumidifier"" mode and the bottom department which gathers water in the ""cooling"" mode. Neither compartment is removable, so be prepared to lift the 100 lb unit to the bathtub to drain, or hold it 2 ft in the air above a bucket.3. The unit floods itself into turning off every hour in cooling mode. The user manual states that the unit should not collect water in cooling mode, but if if is an extremely humid environment it may turn off automatically and show a water warning. This happens every hour. I have triple checked that the fan is set up with the tubing at the suggested height, and it isn't extended more than 2 ft. I live in the notoriously dry state of Colorado, so humidity is not the problem. I have a similar standing AC unit in the next room over that has had no trouble dispelling the water up the tube for the past 3 months, but this one can not seem to last over an hour without turning off and needing drained.I purchased at around $270, which was 40% off at the time. Now I understand why it was marked so low. I recognized the brand name ""Honeywell"" and hoped for better, but was very disappointed.",1
I bought this one early before summer and I'm glad I did because I knew they'd sell out. But the problem is I'm missing some parts. One of them is #2 window panel bracket adapter and #5 plastic pin and the manuel. I was planning on using it this week because we have a heat wave coming but I cannot put it together properly. I finally set it up when it got hot which I should have done it in the very beginning but I did not. When I put it together I turned it on it made the most horrible noise only to find out that there was a piece of plastic broken off from the inside and now it is completely unusable I can't even use the fan. Unfortunately I'm stuck with it and I can't return it and I don't know if I can even go to Honeywell to get the someone to fix it. It definitely wasn't wasted money.,1
"This review is for the Midea Duo. I bought this because I needed a portable AC for one of the bedrooms in my condo because the central air is inadequate. I especially wanted a smart AC so that I could use it with my Alexa ecosystem. Unfortunately, despite the good looks, quiet operation and good build quality, this thing has some major shortcomings that make it unusable and a complete waste of money.For starters, I received it with one of the tabs used to hold the hose in place on the window slider broken. Therefore, I needed a replacement part but Amazon doesn’t carry parts, so they had to send me a while new unit so that I could return the unit with the broken part. This delayed its use. Amazon was good about it so I don’t have any complaints there.The first major issue I have is with the window slider itself, a part that must be used in order to use the AC. For starters, you’d expect a $600 AC to come with high quality accessories but this part is cheaply made, flimsy and thin with absolutely no insulation properties at all. Furthermore, once assembled the sides are not flat, so you are left with gaps between the flat surfaces of the window and the sliders. They give you foam tape to adhere to the edges but this is inadequate. You’re left with a window insert that not only gets hot, but also lets bugs in and sound/ outside noise. The other issue with the slider is that for some stupid reason, they placed the hole for the exhaust hose very close to one edge. Its so close that when you use the sliding window adapter, it hits the sill and cannot snap into place. You have to build it out on that sure to get it to work. Why wouldn’t they just have centered it!? Furthermore, the hose is huge, probably twice the width of standard units and it’s unwieldy, so as gentle as I was being with this thing, one of the tabs broke (again!) and now it won’t connect properly … I had to glue it on with ABS cement so it doesn’t pull out. Unfortunately, due to the uncommon shape of the hose, you cannot upgrade to something else and you are left trying to modify it. Fine, I took two 1x2” wooden rails and created a box to support the sliders and added styrofoam to insulate it.Unfortunately, the second major problem is that this unit does nothing for the humidity while in AC mode because it reuses the condensation to make it more efficient… but, even though I have this thing keeping the room at 68 degrees, it jacked the humidity up to 84%! So the air is really dense and because of this it’s uncomfortable and useless! Unfortunately because of all the time it took to get this thing situated, Ive missed the return window by several days and now I’m out $600!I highly recommend staying away from this product. I really wanted to love it but instead I loathe it!Pros: good build quality of the AC unit itself, wifi and smart app enabled, quiet, blows a good amount of air.Cons: huge unwieldy exhaust hose, cheaply made and poorly designed hose adapter, cheaply made and poorly designed window sliders.",1
"I purchased this product on April 23 ,2021 and paid $717.04 . It was for our bedroom and it is only used during the warmer months (June to end of August ) and only at night . I took it out yesterday June 26 ,2023 for the first time this year and the unit is not cooling ! I did all that was recommended as per the manual( trouble shooting ) and it still did not provide any cool air . A diagnostic revealed that there was a gas leak and it is not repairable . The type of gas is R-410A and is now illegal to use as it is extremely flammable . I contacted Delonghi and was told that the 2 year warranty had expired 2 months ago and there was nothing they could do ! Pretty poor service and how are you suppose to know if the unit was not working in April when there is still snow on the ground . If You add up all the hours that this unit was used it is not a very good investment !",1
"I used to have one of these that worked wonderfully. Same brand and everything which is why I got it. This one does NOT cool at all and if anything just makes the room more humid. Im going to try to get a dehumidifier (though I’m in SoCal so it’s not very wet to begin with) to see if that works along side with this, and if it doesn’t, I’ll have to consider jumping in front of a train because I CANNOT with this heat. By the time that arrives, it’ll probably be too late to send this over priced piece of junk back, if that was ever even an option anyway.",1
Defective immediately on arrival. Felt like it was just a fan. Took cover off to see the pump unable to get water up the tube. Once emptied and flipped over the fan started rattling and I can hear something in it. Total rip off.,1
"It is just an expensive loud fan which makes your place too humid. If you are looking for something to make your hot place too humid and noisy, go for it, because it is not an air cooler. I return it.",1
"We did not have the cooler for very long time and the motor went out, and my husband called the company and the man he spoke to was not very friendly, he said how do you know it is the motor well he know all those thing I think he finely said okay we will send you another one well we have not got it yet .

I would like to have access to a process to return this product.,1
"This portable AC could easily be the poster child for the ""portable air conditioners are highly/the most inefficient air conditioning option"" OR ""portable air conditioners are the air conditioners of last resort"" statement(s).So, this AC was meant for a room under 200 sq. ft., but, because it has some computer equipment in it which generates SOME heat (we're talking high end laptop, not server room), I got this unit for a space almost 4x the square footage of the room. So here are my observations:• Window installation kit should include foam & weather stripping because there are a LOT of gaps left when provided equipment is installed. They don't address these at all! I mean, at least note the need for this before the poor sap (customer) begins the installation process.• Plastic panels.... Well, one side is nice, solid, thick, plastic, & leaves narrow gaps.... The other side is thin, flimsy plastic that not only heats up just from the outside heat, but also leaves a total of 1/2"" worth of gaps... As I noted before, the install kit includes not a darn thing to address this with. The panels warm up (as plastic will) from the ambient air outdoors (especially when installed in a sunny window) AND one side also warms up from the exhaust (making it a double whammy). Before you start installing anything, do yourself the favor of taking measurements and purchasing foam insulation -- best in sheet form so you can cut to sizes you need! AND you will need weather stripping to apply above and below the edges of the plastic panels to best deal with the gaps. The plastic, in fact, heats up so much from the outside, that it actually requires the use of thermal heat shielding on the outward facing surface AND insulation on the interior facing surface. They don't tell you that so you can have everything at the ready before you start the install project --- which is far more involved that the simple set of instructions would lead you to believe.• Note that installation will leave you with a security risk with most types of windows because there is no provision made for dealing with the fact that your window will no longer stay properly closed (much less lock).• This thing generates heat! In initial hours of operation, as is recommended for most ACs & dehumidifiers, it's best to run them on the highest fan & lowest temp. settings. Which is where I started.... Well, the back of the unit heated up like crazy -- almost too hot to keep a hand on. I stuck with it, though, since the room was already warm anyway.... After about 5hrs. of continuous operation it settled into a pattern and ran cooler --- lukewarm or so. But, it still generates heat, which compounds the warmth in the room especially with prolonged use, which means the unit has to fight itself as well as the room conditions. The very definition of inefficient!• The exhaust tube reaches surface temps. in excess of 120˙F. A Cool-Aide insulation kit is a MUST! With the kit installed, the exhaust hose surface temp. stays a bit above the room temp. Without it, there is no way this unit could cool a shoe box! Even with it, the areas where the exhaust hose connects to the unit & where it connects to the window panels are a point of heat getting released into the room you're trying to cool. Again, the very definition of inefficient! In fact, insulating the tube with a thermal/heat barrier & THEN sliding it into the Cool-Aide sleeve is your best option -- cuts the tube's radiant heat to near 0. But, no matter what you do, the exhaust tube's connection points cannot be insulated. Nowhere in the manuals or product descriptions will you see that addressed either! These machines should ALL come with insulating sleeves -- they simply will not cool a room they are sitting in without it & yet none of them come with this critical equipment.• Because of the heat the unit generates along the surfaces near & around the exhaust port (which cannot be insulated in any way), the room temp. NEVER got below 74˙F. In a small room, the unit loses the battle against the heat it generates & it simply doesn't have enough cooling power for even the room size it is rated for. Keep in mind, it wasn't able to get a ~200 sq. foot room below 74 degrees... And even that achievement came only when the unit's fan was at its lowest setting.... So what hope is there of cooling a 400 sq. ft. space?• Noise..... Much noisier than you expect upon reading the decibel ratings. Especially in small rooms. You can't hear yourself think with the fan set to ""high"". And it's not likely to win the battle between the heat in the room & the heat it itself generates on low.... Maybe on medium. When all that is taken into account, the unit is noisy.• Weight..... Be prepared for 10+lbs of added weight from the packing material alone. And, while it IS one of the lightest such units on the market, it's an unwieldy weight. There aren't actual handles for moving the unit as much as grooves in the design you can kind of get your fingertips into if you have ""smallish"" hands. I'll tell you this much, it was a pain getting it up a flight of stairs! Not because of the weight alone, but because it was hard to get a hold of the thing. I have a dehumidifier that weighs about the same as this unit that is FAR easier to move because it has handholds along the top of two sides. Without handholds, this unit is much more difficult to move than you'd expect.• Cold humidity.... That's what you get.... It started off with a room at 86˙F (thank you heat wave) at 40% humidity. It managed to get the room to 74˙F (though set to 67) at 60% humidity.... Which makes no sense for something with a built in dehumidifier & is self-evaporative too! The humidity level should have at the very least remained at 40%. So, what I am dealing with now is a cool, clammy, humid feeling room. Better than hot, humid, clammy -- which is insufferable to me & affects my health -- but definitely will not do in the long run.• Unsightly when set up as needed.... With the addition of the necessary insulation sleeve, this unit doesn't look anywhere near as neat and tidy as the product pictures would lead you to believe.• Takes up virtually as much space as a window unit with the same effect. Aside from the new U shaped window & new saddle window units on the market, these portable units' exhaust setup will take up almost as much space as a window unit for the same-sized room with the added security risk that is much more difficult to address than for a true window unit.... The plastic is too flimsy on this portable unit's exhaust setup to allow for sufficient pressure application to make the window truly secure. A true window unit is much sturdier & allows for windows to be secured in place without worry of breaking brittle plastic panels.• Moving it room to room will not be as easy as it sounds either. You have to go through the while rigamarole of dealing with the gaps with the exhaust panels every time. Not to mention finding a solution for securing the windows each time you move the unit.Any pros., you ask? Well.... It's easy enough to assemble -- consists of just attaching the hose. The controls are big, easy to read, and intuitive -- don't really need a manual to operate it. The castor wheels' design allows for easy movement of the unit even on carpet.My advise...... Window units are indeed better. More of a pain with removal for the season, but definitely not more of an effort to install (when figuring in all the material deficiencies with this unit) and they don't add any of their operating heat back into the environment they are cooling. Second to those are in-wall or through-the-wall units. Third are units that sit outside in the elements (they can be as problematic, though in different & more costly ways, as portable units in my experience). I've now had all three types & can whole heartedly agree with professional assessments of them & rank them the same way. I have a through-the-wall unit that is now 15+ years old (and about to be replaced) that, in all those years, hasn't given me even half the issues I've had with this portable unit did in just ONE day of use. No way this unit would give you that many years of consistent, trouble-free cooling as its window & through-the-wall counterparts -- probably marginally less headaches & expense than external options.I will be sending this thing back from whence it came.... And replacing it within a few days with a window unit. Don't get me wrong, I'm not advertising for window ACs.... I'd MUCH rather work with easily removable exhaust tubes and stuff, but these portable units are indeed incredibly inefficient. One tube, twin tube, the same issues which need to be addressed the same way. They are simply not worth the money, nor the hassle. And they are no more portable, in general, than fixed units simply because of their weight.In conclusion.... Count the true costs before purchasing any portable AC. Stay away from this one in general....If you took the time to read all this, God bless =) And I hope you found it worthwhile in the end.",1
"Update Year 3. My girlfriend asked on a hot day, why aren't you using the swamp cooler. So I cleaned it off and filled it up. Oh yeah the pump doesn't work. It probably stopped working the first year which is why I didn't use it since then. At first I was pleased that it had stopped dumping water out of the back, but this was only because the pump was failing.So I ordered a replacement pump. No refunds on the pump. Honeywell must know what junk this thing is. I took off the back and thought well, I'll also fix the depth indicator (this had never been installed. Impossible to get to. I want to just throw the whole thing out (and never buy another Honeywell anything ever again). But I can't cancel the pump I ordered yesterday that won't arrive for for another 10 days. (They claim it was already shipped. I ordered it 6 pm Saturday, it's 3:30 pm Sunday)Update: 1 Year. It leaks out of the soaker frame in the back-all over the floor. Can only be used outside. No reason this suddenly started happening. It's not an easy fix. The low fill door and missing water level gauge has been a huge annoyance. It would have been so easy to put a large funnel on the top for filling. There are inexplicable button combinations that disable speed. Default On is fan, not cooling. Bottomline? This unit just seems badly designed in many wrong ways. Update: One month. Cleaning. There doesn't seem to be anyway, other than through the fill door to get my hand, and a sponge to the bottom of the tank. There seems to be no instructions for cleaning it out. TIP: before buying any evaporative cooler Google how to clean it first. Honeywell only seems to have marketing happy talk. General instructions for this type of cooler are not useful because there's no way to get inside this model. I've only run reverse osmosis water, and ran maybe 12 gallons through in the past month, last weekend after I filled it up I noticed gunk floating around in the water. So it needs cleaning out on a regular basis. Not a big deal-- if you can gain access.Old review: I just received this and got it working. What I immediately noticed: Instead of one useless user manual, there are two. There's also a Honeywell video, don't bother: You already know what a swamp cooler does. You can read the buttons on the top of the machine. That's all the video covers. A complete waste of time.What is the capacity of this? I think it's about 6 gallons, but I couldn't find anything in the manuals or the website that cover this.The water level window seems pretty useless (that's because the indicator needle is sitting loose on the bottom of the tank. ) I put in at least three gallons and it doesn't even register at the Minimum.It takes a lot of water, but the water intake door is just OK at best. They could've easily designed a huge funnel as the side panel to raise the point you add water, and so you could add water as fast as you can pour. ) It cools by adding water to the air, that water evaporates which requires heat, so the air cools. If you use this in a closed room, the humidity will rise to the saturation point and no more cooling will occur. I'm using this in Los Angeles where humidity levels are 45% to 60%, though the first day I used this the report was 84%. It's worked pretty good across this range. The output fan is strong, the output temperature is about 10 degrees F below the temperature of the intake air. It sits next to an open door, so it's not recirculating room air. This should give you an idea of how well this will work.It sits near where I work on my computer, at low the air flow is pretty high, so if you need a swamp cooler for just one person in one basic position, then this unit is probably too large 500 CFM, half would probably do it.I remain annoyed about the fill method and it arriving with a broken fill level indicator. (Using the levered needle is pretty stupid design. The fill level window is very low on the unit. There's a float right next to this stupid fill level window. So why even use a float and a lever if the level window is so low on the unit???? With a float or levered indicator needle it would be dead simple to show the level right at the top of the unit where it could be easily read. Also the ice compartment at the top. It would not be at all difficult to add a little flap and make this the fill point-it's huge compared to the stupid little flap on the side. Anyone at Honeywell paying attention????)",1
"this machine does not cool, does not work, received defective machine, waste of money",1
"I purchased this in May 2016 to cool a small 14 x 6 server room that has two ThinkServers and a few switches -enough heat buildup to be a issue but not enough to expect cooling to be a major problem.The first unit died in about 3 months, and Tripp Lite support was kind enough to ship a replacement unit. This cost me $50 in shipping & a week without cooling but I did learn some things which may help you.First, while speaking to tech support, I found out that this unit is only designed to run 4-6 hours per day. That could be a problem when it's 100 degrees outside, the office A/C is off for the weekend, your servers are spewing heat, and the temp is set to 65 on the SRCOOL12k. Lesson: The office A/C is still going to have to take on the majority of the cooling work.Second lesson. I had the first unit set to ""high"" and the thermostat set about 4 degrees cooler than the office A/C. I assumed it would cool down & then run intermittently after that. I was wrong. It ran constantly. I believe the issue is that it exhausts so much air from the room that it is constantly sucking in warmer air from the office & can never get ahead of itself. I now have the fan set to low & it seems to be doing a much better job.Third lesson. If you live in an area where humidity is a problem, run the hose. We bought into the marketing that this would evaporate the humidity in the exhaust. It overflowed on the weekend & made a mess. After that we ran a drain hose & it's worked well since.Fourth lesson. The SNMP module for this thing made it a lot more complicated than it was worth. Even after you get past the fact that you need an old in-secure version of java to run it, it seems to get confused. Simple is better. I removed the SNMP kit & am just letting it run with the front panel controls. I'll find another gizmo to monitor the temp & alert.Last recommendation: based on the first one dying after 3 months, buy the extended warranty.I considered numerous residential/commercial air conditioning units but went with this one because it seemed to be designed for the IT environment. I therefore assumed that it would offer better reliability & better controls than the other A/C units, especially with the SNMP module. I was wrong. I have other Tripp Lite equipment that works well but this is tarnishing the brand. I believe I would have been as well off or better off with one of the $400 units from the big box home improvement store.Summary: When it works it works acceptably well. Documentation is average at best. Some best practices/scenarios would really have helped. Support was good. If you are cooling racks there is likely value in the tubing that they provide to duct air into the rack. If you are just cooling a room like me you can likely get more cooling for your buck with a standard air conditioner.*** Update ***The replacement unit died in September 2017. No one fixes them, the factory warranty was over so I filed a claim on the extended warranty. Kudos to Square Trade, they don't fix them either but they did issue a check for the purchase price. I bought another room air conditioner at the local home improvement store for a couple hundred dollars less than this unit. Frankly the new one is doing a better job of cooling. We'll see if it lasts longer.",1
"I purchased this machine 13 months ago. I maybe used it 8 times. It no longer blowed cold air. I called multiple Amana service numbers which were unable to help. I finally spoke to someone who said this machine is only covered for 12 months, so I should just call a repairman. They honestly couldn’t even walk me through any troubleshooting. Even when it worked it was VERY loud. Don’t waste your money.",1
"I bought this portable air conditioner for my cabin. I rarely needed to use it but when it was extremely hot I needed something to cool the cabin down. So I bought it in 2020 but used it a total of 8-9 times. This year I turned it on and it blew hot air only. I have always done everything the manufacturer said to do (clean the filter, drain the unit, etc.) and it still quit. Good luck finding someone to repair one of these units.",1
"*Update - the company has been unhelpful and outright lazy in trying to troubleshoot my unit not working. They asked me to ship the unit back for repairs. If anyone has guessed, the cost of packaging and shipping something this big to another country is astronomical in comparison to the price paid for a unit that lasted about 1 year. They must know their product is no good - hence the 1 year warranty on the unit and the measly 3 year on the converter. From what I’ve seen from other’s experiencing the same - especially in Canada - this item will cost you SO much more than the price tag and a lot of headaches. Not to mention being down almost a grand and without AC in the middle of summer. You’ve been warned*Worked great last summer. Maintained it well, stored approximately over winter. Took it out this spring and it worked for 2 months before it completely stopped cooling the air. Follower all the troubleshooting and contacted the company who refuses to speak on the phone. After 6 “troubleshooting” emails back and forth, I’m still stuck with a glorified fan in the middle of summer. I’d expect a lot more support and performance after spending almost a thousand dollars. Buyer beware",1
"The media could not be loaded. Initially, I love the product it is very cold. The description is correct as far as the cooling on the downside the bottom drips. initially, I love the product it is very cold. The description is correct as far as the cooling on the downside the bottom drips like crazy! When I was moving the product, I noticed my wood dresser was completely soaked. when I was moving the product, I noticed my wood dresser was completely soaked. Just be aware. You will have to have do you have a towel underneath it.",1
"Seems like just a misting fan. Water isn't especially cool. Also, the charge has never held. So it has to be plugged in at all times if you want to use it. Not as advertised. Was supposed to hold a charge for 6 hours. Not very pleased with the cost of this item. Cant even get a replacement or return at this point. :(",1
"At first the Artic Air cooler worked fine, but then after a few times of use the lights stop working and then it stopped working all together. It only has a 30 day Manufacture's warranty. We purchased in June for around 100.00 and now its Sept and it does not work. I would not recommend purchasing this outdoor cordless cooler. If you must purchase you should also purchase with a product warrantee.",1
I gave this 1 star because it arrived on time. After turning it on the first time my husband turned the off knob. It made a very loud noise & would not turn back on.,1
"No idea why it stopped working all of a sudden. Everything is clean and looks okay; it's just not cooling, It's really not worth the money even after they reduced the price.",1
"I never usually write reviews but I feel ripped off & want to help someone else find another ac unit instead of this one!!I used this occasionally for 3 summer months in 2023, I always cleaned it & put it away in an indoor closet for the fall/winter. I took it out today & it has not been blowing cool air at all. It’s recycling the air but the “cool” function is not working. I have tried everything the manual says to fix the problem with no avail. I don’t have $240 each summer to buy a new ac unit for my apartment. This should work for longer than 3 months of occupational usage considering the unit is indoors unlike most others that are exposed to the elements !Noise level- loud ! Even on the sleep setting it is noisy , you can’t hear anything over it. Which is fine for someone like me that enjoys loud fans but for my partner , they prefer it to be quiet.Installation- I have standard windows that slide up, the piece that pops into the window & then into the hose is too big . I had to duct tape it to the window sill & to the hose to hold it all into place.",1
This cooler never works and I tried to returned to get my refund I talked to Amazon they open the case with the seller but I never get any refund . I had to dispose the product and I loose 237 dollar went to the trash .very desapoint.,1
"It is a piece of junk. We had it a month and a half and on the control panel, one of the controls broke.",1
keeps dehumidfying when not set to that mode; overfills water reservoir. water reservoir cap does not stay put. Leaks all over the place. Leaking freezes. Ice covers filter. Filter freezing prevents unit from circulating air. Garbage unit useless bought in May 2023 (had some hiccups that spring thru fall where hose did not stay attached and unit leaked but OK) then was unable to use when re-installed for new season in April 2024 AT ALL.,1
A/C with USA plug. We used 2 adapters and they are burned immideately.So its unuseful. What to do?,1
I honestly don't know what the purpose of this is. I bought it because I needed a room cooled down that had no windows (if it had windows I would have used a window unit or something that could put the hot air out the window). I don't need it inside my house because we have AC. BUT instead of cooling my garage down it made it HOTTER AND SO HUMID. I work in my garage and was starting to feel sick from the heat when I realized the instructions say you can't use it in an enclosed space. It didn't say that anywhere on the page before I bought it. Now I can't even return it so I just wasted SO MUCH MONEY on something I CANT EVEN USE. Really disappointed. Hope to save people from wasting money on this in the future.,1
"Definitely not worth the money. I paid over $600.00 with taxes & bought a warranty. The exhaust is hot, but there's no where for it to go but inside. It defeats the purpose. Definitely not recommended. Especially for this outrageous price. It only points at 1 person. Ridiculous! This product needs to go back!!!",1
The fan is clicking and grinding. I have contacted the seller multiple times with no response,1
Doesn’t work and it will cost $180 to ship back. Amazon is a scam.,1
"This product is not worth the money. It is basically a fan! Does very little cooling. As a matter of fact, I couldn't tell the difference between cooling and fan cycles.Also, if you want to return it.... They charge UPS shipping and a 50% re-stocking fee!Do yourself a favor and look into other products!",1
"Barely blows out fresh air , not an AC , more like a small tiny fan for your face , cool LED lights, but I wouldn’t buy it again , it’s not a good fan",1
"I received two of this item last year, a 10k BTU and 12k BTU. The 10k one works fine, however the 12k BTU one just does not get cold anymore. I have checked everything: dust, blockages, as well as letting it go in fan mode for ~10 minutes before switching it onto cool. Nothing works. The item was described as ""excellent"" refurbished; however, when I bought it I did note on the inside some crushed in parts of the condenser. It worked last year, so I figured it was fine. Nope.I absolutely cannot recommend a product that does not do the one thing I want it to do. Especially when it is so expensive. Two stars as the other one works I guess so maybe you will get lucky and yours does not break.",1
"Refurbished, but came broken !",1
Doesn't fit on the attachment that all my other AC use. Have to return,1
Leaks water. Calling Portacool results in being on hold and then disconnection. Avoid this product and company.,1
"This unit is terrible. I usually am pretty forgiving and gracious on reviews but this unit hardly cools a 11x11 ft room and it's so loud, it sounds broken and i can hear it drom downstairs!. It's definitely not a soothing or relaxing sound. I definitely would not recommend this unit whatsoever.... too many choices to go with poorest quality product like this one. SMH",1
"This is not good for areas with high temperatures, you're better off buying a real swamp cooler! Only the top portion of the vents has airflow the bottom part is closed off so nothing comes out which limits the amount of cool air if any.",1
Remote doesn’t work. Rotation feature doesn’t work. Sleep mode is no quieter than normal mode. Water level is very difficult to see. Instructions written by a Chinese speaker and very unclear. Ice packs very small and flimsy. Operating it for one and one-half hours did not cool my bedroom even one degree.,1
"We bought this product twice. The first time in April, 2023 and the second time in June 2023. The one we bought in June has been used in our living room and up until now, it has worked amazing. No issues. Well, unfortunately today, that all changed. If we try to use the cool setting, it will automatically turn off after 1 minute with the error code “E5” on the little display. I read through the manual and nowhere does it mention the E5 Error code. I cleaned the little filters to see if maybe that would help solve the issue but no luck. It works just fine on the fan setting but not the cooling setting. Another review (From July 2024) mentioned this error code as well. They said they had to contact customer service and after struggling to get in contact, they were told that they don’t know what it means and that they just need to replace the entire unit. I just contacted support and I’m waiting to hear back, hopefully with better news than that customer received. If I get told how to fix this or they offer to replace our unit, I’ll update my review and let y’all know. As of right now though, I’m highly disappointed. When we ordered this, we paid $340. As of right now, this is not worth $340. We’ve only had this a year.",1
I received this item without the ice packs and wheels! It also didn't come with instructions on how to operate. It's pretty easy to figure it out but I like having instructions so I don't screw it up.,1
"I’m a truck driver (semitrailer) I used this item cooler inside my cab to cool down my sleeper but , the outside temperature was 80 degrees and I was sweaty with cooler works more than 2 hours with ice cold water , I can’t sleeping cause the air from cooler was hot NOT cold!.",1
"The media could not be loaded. I've had the 8K version for some time now and it's been great. It's not quiet, but it's never been annoying. I just plugged in the 12K version for a larger room and the engine has a constant chirping sound that sounds like crickets. I'm going to give it a few days to run to see if the sound peters out into something tolerable but if it keeps up I'll have to organize a return, and with a unit this large, that's going to be a real pain.Edit: If you request a return or exchange, Amazon does not offer a pick-up option. The only option is to deliver it yourself to a UPS Store, so good frickin' luck with that if you don't drive a truck. Oh, sure, you can pay UPS to come pick it up for you for an extra charge that the seller then won't reimburse you for.If the replacement unit turns out to be faulty and I have to pay UPS for two returns, I'll be reporting the seller and never buying from them again.Edit 2: The replacement unit makes the EXACT SAME metallic rattling/grinding noise that my 8000 BTU unit does not. It's so annoying that I can hear it from a completely different room. How do two different units have this exact same problem?To boot, the second unit was delivered LAYING ON ITS SIDE, which you aren't supposed to do with an AC. Nevertheless, I let it sit for more than 24 hours before testing it out. I was relieved at first when there was no grinding sound being made. Five minutes later, it won't stop. I can't tolerate it and there's no way I can sleep in a room where something is making this awful sound.",1
"We rarely give bad reviews, but the circumstances associated with this purchase have left us no alternative.We installed a new hardwood floor in our daughter’s bedroom and wanted to use a portable AC unit to cool the space.We bought a new LG 10000-BTU Inverter Portable Air Conditioner unit that is designed to shut itself off if there is a potential for leakage. The unit was installed in the bedroom and ran trouble free for several months. It was not moved from that location during this period of time.We then noticed water leakage on the new hardwood floor under the portable AC unit and immediately performed routine maintenance on the unit (cleaned filters and emptied the water collection tank). The leakage was substantial enough to cause permanent damage to the floor.To prevent further damage to the new floor we bought a drip tray to put under the unit and a leak detection system to let us know if it does leak.We then called LG Customer Service to determine why the portable AC unit did not shut itself off before leaking on the new wood flooring. After over 45 minutes of discussion, they agreed to schedule a service call by D.G. Appliance Service.A technician from D.G. Appliance Service arrived and discovered that the unit had a cracked water collection tank. He stated that he had performed repairs of cracked water collection tanks in the past but did not have the resources (helpers) to repair it now. He left without fixing the unit and reported that the unit had ""Physical Damage"" to his supervisor. He advised us to contact LG Customer Service to resolve the issue.We contacted LG Customer Service on the same day and were told that the warrantee did not apply since there was ""Physical Damage"" to the unit.We disputed the finding because the unit clearly had this damage upon arrival, and we reported it within the one-year warranty period.It took several months for the defect to manifest itself for several reasons:First, the LG technical support documentation is very explicit in their warnings that the unit is never to be laid on its side (or back) and should be kept in an upright position at all times - Otherwise, you risk damaging the cooling system. In order to have detected this damage upon shipment we would have had to lay the unit on its side to be able to visually inspect the water collection tank located at the bottom. This is exactly what the technician did to determine that the water collection tank was cracked. We had to help him support the unit in a horizontal position while he inspected the bottom of the unit with a flashlight.Second, for the first few months that the unit was operating the weather was fairly mild, and the unit was able to evaporate the condensation as it ran without having a buildup in the water collection tank. The heatwaves that started in mid-summer precipitated the condensation buildup in the unit's water collection system and led to the leakage through the cracked water collection tank.Since the unit was never moved from its initial installation location there was never an opportunity to damage the water collection tank except for in shipping or manufacturing.We were forced into buying an identical LG AC unit to replace the first leaky one since the permanent venting that we installed in our daughter’s bedroom made switching to a different brand difficult. Upon plugging the replacement unit into our wall socket the circuit breaker in our main panel tripped. No amount of re-setting the circuit breaker would cure the situation and we were forced to pay an electrician to trouble shoot and replace the circuit breaker. We immediately returned the replacement unit and received a third identical LG AC unit that appears to be working.We have contacted at least a dozen LG authorized and non-authorized repair centers to fix the first leaky unit but none of them will repair a portable AC unit. So we have this POS sitting in our garage waiting to get recycled…",1
I was expecting like the picture said it is cool air. And i put two freeze ice bags plus ice cubes and cool water and i only received ifresh air like regular fan,1
"Not only did it not blow any air out, it starts loudly shocking itself & filled my apartment with an awful burning plastic smell. Dont waste your $$$",1
A box fan could cool the average room down better than this junk. Don't bother buying and get something that doesn't use ice packs. Returning this immediately,1
You are better off just getting a regular fan or a regular air conditioner this does not blow really cold air.,1
"When I first turned it on, the fan was very noisy and obviously catching internally. So, I spent about 30 minutes dismantling the plastic to find that the anchors for the fan motor housing are about 1-2 mm to long. (Very bad dedign.) Shaved them down with a Dremel and now it works as intended. This Chinese product has a poorly designed fan and fan housing. If you don't mind a little project, then this is perfect. I would have returned, but it took over a week to get it in the first place. I have buyers remorse, but you get what you pay for.",1
This is in no way an air cooling machine. It is just a fan. Don't be deceived. The air is the same temperature no matter if the ice packs are in the machine or not. Waste of money.,1
This item doesn't perform as advertised. It's no more powerful than a common $30 table fan AND it cost ME an additional $75.00 to return it by UPS from Toronto to Guelph facility.!!! Not impressed...,1
"The cooler was no better than a cooling fan, Even with the ice packs, it was no better than a cooling fan.My room was only 120 sq ft and even after running the cooler for a couple of hours, the room was not cool.",1
I thought this would do a better job. I was really disappointed here but it just wasn't what I needed which was an AC so I replaced this with the AC,1
We were very disappointed in this item.,1
"Ordered the biggest one available. Received it and was broken. (Shipping damage) Received my second one and the media pads aren’t getting fully wet, which doesn’t cool the air correctly. Contacted hessair and they said it was a pump. To do x,y, and z to get a replacement. I didn’t have time for all that, so I buy a bigger pump than original, install, and doing same exact thing. Had to be a block at the top. Now I have a choice, return and try a third or pull apart on my very busy (hot) day and see what’s going on. Not worth the $1300.",1
"The media could not be loaded. This was bought to cool a space of about 550 square feet during the summer heat in Kansas. We got it and did a temporary install to try it out before officially putting a hole in the wall for the exhaust.The Set Up: the set up is pretty self-explanatory. When you take a look at the quick start guide that they provide. However, the drain tube was a little bit more complicated seeing as there are two drain ports, and only one drain tube provided. We initially installed the drain tube on the bottom port thinking that’s where it was supposed to go and eventually switched it to the middle port after we opened it up and realized there was water in the middle port. The instructions do not specify, if once installed in the middle port the bottom port needs to stay open or we need to get another hose. It just kind of doesn’t talk about it.The Unit: In the video we’ve had it on for about 45 minutes and the room is still quite hot. All windows and doors are closed there’s no air leaks anywhere. The unit itself is noisy but I’d be willing to overlook this if it actually cooled. There are brief moments when it will shoot out very cold air and then all of a sudden it’s like the fan is the only thing running. You can even hear a change in the way it sounds when the compressor is working and when it’s only the fan. Honestly based on reviews I expected the unit to cool quickly or at least cool the space instead of circulating the air.The Remote: five of the buttons on the remote are not available for the model that I purchased. The guide says to push turbo button to turn on a faster mode, more powerful mode and honestly it does not make a difference.Overall for the price and the unit as it’s advertised, I would not recommend it does not cool, which is literally the reason that it was purchased it’s been running now for about an hour as I’m finishing this review and the room has yet to even begin cooling down at all. Essentially we just purchased a very expensive fan. Will be returning this product.",1
"Update: This is a very poorly designed AC model. I have had the unit for a month now and I wish I had of bought a window unit. So not only is it noisier then my last window AC unit, there is this knocking sound that sounds like something it loose. I tried to use to the remote a week later and it wouldn't work. I tried to turn it on and off and a bunch of other functions. Nadda. I emailed the manufacturer about the remote and let them know and they said only a few options actually work on the remote control... Not sure why they would have buttons on the remote if they don't do anything...The biggest issues I have found with the unit it the water. It comes with a hose that could be put out the windows if its close enough to it. I had to use a bucket as the hose was too short. But the hose is at the top of the water collection so it essentially dose nothing. A few drops came out. The unit shut off and said that it was full of water but the drain plug is all the way at the bottom of the unit.... No removable container. No room to get anything under it to drain it. You either have to be super strong to be able to life it into the tub or roll it outside to drain the water out.... Its very hard to move around with the extra weight of the water even though its on wheels... I wish I had of done more research before buying this unit.It is noisier then my old window unit. The window kit does not fit any of my windows so I to improvise and use some tape. All the window kits pieces were the same size. Should come with a couple smaller pieces to be able to fit all window sizes. Its actually only 5000BTU not 8000BTU. It throws out a lot of heat from the back which is where the air intake is. It does cool but I wish I had of gotten a 5000BTU window AC unit for a fraction of the cost. Not worth the $400 in my opinion.",1
"As a senior I cannot return it now, too heavy and I live alone even after I asked them for a return.",1
"Purchased this unit for bedroom after reading several reviews that raved. I watched video on best method for set up and use; seemed easy enough. Started it up when warm weather kicked in; did nothing. Watched video again and did exactly as stated using ice packs that were included. Started up again with curtains closed, door closed walked into a sauna on a 75 degree night. This product does not work.",1
Do not buy. Worked for 6 months and nothing but a pain.,1
"I have had this unit for 2 weeks and it no longer blows cold air. Unit was installed properly, drain line is clear, filters are clean, not iced up, on cool mode and waited allotted time before turning unit on. It worked great for the first week and a half and now only blow hot air.",1
"I was actually very excited about getting this product as i wanted to be able to use it outdoors in the evenings to cool the patio and/or the garage if I am working out there. It gets extremely hot in AZ where 100 - 117 degrees is common during the summer. I used ICE and the frozen blocks with the water but it blows cold for only a short time and then it blow warm air when its set for cool air. The fan also is not very strong as you can barely feel the breeze when you are sitting only 4-6 feet away, so a very weak fan.I will be returning this product back and hopefully get a full refund.",1
"Product was purchased as a gift. The unit was just recently opened, past the amazon return policy date. The unit does not turn on, light up or make any kind of indication that it is a functioning unit. It seems to be defective, but cannot return through amazon. Very disappointed in this purchase, as I should have opened and checked before gifting. I just assumed that it would work considering reviews and the price. Hoping seller can issue a refund or replacement.",1
"It’s very portable due to the light weight when empty, the pump and design works nice, however after a year of use, the medium and low fan stopped working. I’ve always left it on high but the medium nor low work now. Since idk when but it just shuts off the fan. But the high has a nice breeze to it. Overall worth it for my use. UPDATE: Now the high setting no longer works so therefore the entire thing is useless now. Lasted a little over a year but not worth it.",1
"Extremely disappointment with this Portable AC NPLD3-06C/X1E AKA CF1 that I recently purchased from Amazon. This product is, without a doubt, the worst of the worst in terms of misrepresented products sold on Amazon.I purchased a 10,000 BTU 450 sq ft unit, but the unit I received is only 6000 BTU and does not cover 450 sqft or even the 350 sqft it says on the box. The part number listed on the unit says 150 to 300 sq ft max coverage. On other listingd. This product has three different part numbers and three different listed manufacturers associated and included with the unit. information, including Acekool, Creative Inovations Inc, CFI, and a myriad of incorrect and unverifiable information.The unit also short cycles off and on every 3 to 5 minutes, and the user manual is filled with discrepancies and typos. This is clearly a very poor sub-standard Chinese knockoff. I found 24 different manufacturers online that use this same part number. This is obviously whiteboxed by a company and sold to anyone wanting to buy a few and slap their branding on them.I am extremely disappointed with this product and will be returning it immediately.",1
"This thing is ineffective. The exhaust air that flows through the exit duct heats up behind the unit, competing with the cool air in front. So, the temperature in my 150-square-foot room never drops below 80 degrees Fahrenheit overnight. Humidity is still over 69% throughout the day.Furthermore, we will always be concerned about the water overflowing and window adapter detaching from the window when the unit is moved slightly. The window adapter is useless and had to use duct tape to keep it from falling down. The widow adapter also does not keep heat out and will leak with the heat coming from the air duct.This device also takes up a lot of space with a bucket for collecting the water. Instead, I bought an AC window unit from LG, which is much more efficient and takes up no space; the entire room is cooled below 60 degrees Fahrenheit in less than two hours. Never again I will purchase a portable air conditioner.",1
"It works like a regular fan, its not could at allWaist of money",1
"A real pity this didn't work. We bought this months ago in preparation for an extended camping trip. My bad for not testing it ahead of time. When we went to use it, an E1 error is the only thing it'd display and would only run the fan. E1 = malfunctioning ambient temp sensor which can't be repaired.",1
The product arrived undamaged. It doesn't cool at all. You'd be better off with a fan.,1
"After a horrible first delivery with a severely damaged and opened box that was missing the manual and remote, I sent it back and received another one.After setting it all up, I noticed that it makes a loud moaning sound in heat or cool mode. Worse, it cycles on and off so that you can't even try to get used to it!It was so loud when I tried to sleep with it on that my wife and I turned it off. This unit is in the bedroom. You can hear the loud moaning with the bathroom door shut. You can hear it all the way out in the kitchen.If you can't sleep with it, you can't keep it. We have already Been through a lot returning the first one I will run this for a day or two to see if we can get used to it before our ears give out, or if it quiets down.Super disappointed so far. GE used to be a name that meant something. Apparently not today. Newer technology should mean a new one would be much quieter than ones I have owned in the past. Nope!UPDATE:I returned it, and bought a much less expensive and much quiter Black and Decker 14,000 btu model. Satisfied so far, still waiting for my close to 700 dollar refund from Amazon for the horrible GE branded a/c.",1
"Horrible service and finger pointing. Never delivered after 1 month, and both GE and Amazon wont give me a credit.",1
The compres sd or kept kicking on and off. I returned it.,1
The air conditioner literally worked two days then stopped working.,1
Quit oscillating after 12 months of use. I used as a fan only.,1
This AC unit is a nice size for a very small area. It does not cool off an entire room and it is a little louder than that I thought. It wasn’t expensive but you get what you pay for with this one.,1
"Opened one package 21 days after purchase. The units do not have a hose connection. It is not explained in the description that they have to manually fill the tanks. We are not able to do that. Requested a return authorization from the vendor on the 25th day. They never responded. We applied a request again and now the Vendor says they says they (4 units) are now not returnable. THIS IS NOT RIGHT! We will be appealing to Amazon to make the Vendor take these back, still new (only one opened) and none of them ever used.",1
"It worked great for a little bit, now it won't stop leaking all over my carpet.",1
Dislike the cost of the item that has hardly a few hours on it. Compressor runs a few minutes and then shuts off and on continuously.,1
"I have had this AC for a little over a year. In that time, I have only used it for around 6 months before it just stopped working on all functions. When I start it up, I only hear a whirring noise in the unit like it is trying to start but won't. I would advise going with a different brand of AC unit.",1
Looks good. No leaks but this is NOT as advertised as being able to hook up to most reverse osmosis water filters which is why I bought it so save more counter top space. I have reached out to the sellar to try to troubleshoot shoot but no response,2
"For garden display but most of the time , the light didn’t on .",2
"I never received the package, after three attempt I cancel the order. more than a month later the refund never been made and Affirm start charging my account today. please send my refund ASAP.Thanks!",2
The XBOX console was in good shape externally but would not read my game discs. I took my discs to a local game store and their original XBOX console was able to read all of them.,2
"Was easy to set up for my daughter. Can't go wrong with a hundred dollar(the suggested retail price) phone that does everything the others do.It's a bit slow, but works lol.Very very slow.Feel over charged at 200$ not a good buy. Id return it but Im too late.",2
"Looks good but I was expecting 2 controllers And A headset. That's what they advertised when I got ahold of am. Azon, they were like sorry, yet their personal guarantee is on this that you will get everything so disappointed.",2
Yep 360S had some internet connection issues which forced me to buy the adapter which is fine. But major problem is some OG Xbox disc CAN play on this but you need the original official hard drive that contains the code. Which forced me to buy and hunt for a new official hard drive ! The hard drive in the picture is a knock off version which contains no special code ……,2
"Just arrived, colours are not as advertised. Ordered only because the jelly fish was blue, however it does not have blue at all.",2
Not worth the hype in my opinion. There was VERY little difference in the before and after for me and my daughter.,2
Not worth the hype in my opinion. There was VERY little difference in the before and after for me and my daughter.,2
I bought this item because of the 5 star reviews.I’ve used this several times with absolutely no difference in my teeth color. I would not recommend.,2
"I was super excited to try this carbon toothpaste that also whitens! The packaging is great and the color of the paste is pleasing to the eye. Here's the thing though, I don't think I'm the target demographic because it did nothing for my teeth. I'm trying not to blame the product because my teeth are pretty stained from when I smoked for years and also coffee. So I didn't notice any significant or even insignificant change to the color of my teeth when I used this but when I switched back to my usual whitening toothpaste, I of course noticed it immediately. Perhaps someone without the wear and tear of my dental history will have better luck. This could work on someone with only light staining on their teeth but unfortunately not for me.",2
"Tastes of grape, that's all, doesn't whiten teeth",2
It did not attach to the toothpaste tube tight enough.,2
"The product comes out as a foaming mess that has a disgusting feeling in the mouth. I tried it anyway, to give it a chance. Absolutely no difference in teeth color than before. Don't waste your money.",2
The seal was broken and the product was very moist from humidity and I will not be using.,2
If I had seen that these tablets were foaming toothpaste tablets I would not have purchased them. I ended up having to go to the store to purchase some without that ingredient.,2
"I expected that each eye would adjust as needed; however, the one eye that I needed improvement appeared to adjust but my other eye, without any sight problem, also adjusted so now I have the same problem but the other eye. Cheaper to keep as back up then return.",2
The autofocus works fine. I just had cataract surgery 4 weeks ago and the second eye last week so I couldn't focus to even use my cell phone. The glasses are cheaply made but will hopefully last for 5 more weeks until my prescription ones arrive.,2
"GOOD QUALITY LENSES BUT THE FRAME IS BROKE IN A MONTH, LIKE I'VE BOUGHT CHEAP QUALITY. VERY DISAPOINTED , SOMETHING WENT WRONG WITH MATERIAL THEY STARTED USE , HAD MY OTHER PAIR FOR YEARS AND IT TOOK A BEATING, THIS TIME VERYWEAK CONSTRUCTION",2
The lens came off several times and I ultimately lost one of the pait. The lenses were meticulously cleaned before installation. They worked well until the lens fell out Disappointed!,2
Too Heavy,2
"While I measured carefully, the clips were too narrow for my glasses so I returned them. Lesson learned--seller refunded less than half of the purchase price.",2
"I need very light reading correction (0.5), which these claim to help since they range 'automatically' from 0.5-2.5 in strength. At a normal reading distance for me, everything is very blurry with these on, there is no 'auto' adjusting. The product name also mentions ""multi flex focus dial"". I don't know what 'multi flex' is supposed to mean, but I can tell you there is NO focus dial. As far as I can tell they are plain 2.5 strength readers, which, for me, is way too strong. Color me disappointed and shame on the seller for keyword stuffing their product name with incorrect info.",2
AFTER OPENING THE PACKAGE AND CHARGING THE GLASSES I PUT THEM ON AND THEY SCRATCH MY NOSE. I CHECKED THEM AND THERE WAS NO NOSE PIECE TO PROTECT MY NOSE. I HAD TO RETURN THEM AND ORDER ANOTHER BRAND.,2
Quality is fine for the price but I look like Mrs Claus. lol. I'm not even that old.,2
"I might have ordered the wrong magnification, but I also didn't like the iridescent coating on the outside of the lenses.",2
The lens automatically fog up when you put the glasses on and I think they are low quality lens. Love the look and the replacement batteries but I will not reorder these.,2
"I decided to try bifocals for my first readers, hoping they’d save me from constantly taking them on and off. Unfortunately, they didn’t quite work out. The reading focal area is way too low, which makes it uncomfortable and awkward to use. The focus area is oddly positioned and doesn’t blend well with the rest of the frame, making it look unattractive. While they’ll do in an emergency, the quality just isn’t there. I ended up switching to a different brand with progressive lenses for a much better experience.",2
I've been wearing Foster Grant reading glasses for years and always purchase the same model. The glasses that I ordered were to be Ironman IronFlex black/red framed glasses. Instead of shipping the ordered glasses I was sent unframed glasses blue/grey#dg1123 IM1001 GUN. I was to receive IM2002 model but didn't. Caution buying these glasses.,2
I purchased these to replace my previous pair of the same glasses. These seem to be much larger and kept falling off my head/face. Will be returning these.,2
This is the third pair of these exactly same glasses that I’ve purchased. This pair was loose at the temples on arrival and tightening didn’t resolve the issue. Kept because they arrived at Christmas just before traveling out of town,2
Don’t waste your money on these glasses! Worn for reading only and the lens falls out! The arms are extremely tight. Very flimsy.,2
I dislike the feeling of wearing them and seeing outside the frames and inside. It was very odd and disconcerting. I returned them. They made you dizzy looking up.,2
Cannot wear for a long time as edges are hard. Have to line up perfectly as not to have double vision.,2
I braved the bright morning commute sunshine to test these. (I'm just a passenger) No shading at all. Yes I gave them time sat them on my dash too. No luck. Painful. Wearing my polarized sunglasses I could see some slight rainbow staring on the edges but not enough to tint the lenses. Also the bifocal line is really pronounced right in the middle of my eyeline - and maybe that's just the size of my face I have a smaller head. If you zoom in on my pic you can see what I'm talking about. I could still use inside or at home but only while specifically reading. I don't think I could walk around with the bifocal line.,2
Attempted to catch them from falling from my face and they snapped in 2..,2
Doesn’t cool at room the size it says it does:-(,2
"I usually don’t write reviews, especially negative ones. I liked this product when I initially got it. But after using it for only two summers the pump stopped working even with regular cleaning and maintenance. Because the water is no longer pumped into the filter, it does not actually cool anything. It looks like the pump can’t be easily replaced. So I liked it in the beginning but it didn’t last. Now I just use it as a bulky floor fan.",2
Don't recommend it,2
This unit just blows hot air around and doesn’t measure the temp in the room only the temp of air it’s putting out.,2
"The ice packs would melt and warm up fast, and you only felt the cool air when you are about 2 feet or closer. The fan does not blow hard/fast enough.",2
This product cools my from 95 degrees to about 90 degrees if I’m lucky. Save your money and buy an a/c unit.,2
It stays cool for a few hours and then doesn’t. It’s also difficult to clean as you can’t remove the tank.,2
Don’t cool down,2
Does not blow cold air long even with the ice pack in the bottom,2
I ordered this to cool a bed room for my kids. It’s hot and humid.. the AC UNIT needs work and thought this would help but wasn’t worth it and ima have to return.. I don’t feel the difference from fan to AC it’s all the same the humidifier looks like it works as the vents cleaned my air in 1day the filter was getting fDirty,2
The only time you cool off is if you’re right in front of it.I don’t not recommend and SUCH a waist of money!,2
Annoying flashing lights when off. Ice packs swell too much even half full. Good for a small room but not a powerful fan. Can't complain for the price though.EDIT 9/23/2022: Piece of junk now. Swing function quit working. Pump intermittent and indicator light quit working. Cheap for a reason. Would not buy again.,2
"Received this couple months ago doesn't do much ,,fan works better .not advisable for the money very disappointed",2
What a joke! This cooler might cool you if you stand right in front of it. It would not cool 5 square feet let alone 200 square feet. It is a pain in the but you have to have keep filling it with water and ice bottle (which lasts about 25 minutes. 2out of 5!,2
Wouldn’t buy again.1. This doesn’t substitute an air conditioner2. Works with water and electricity3. You need to have it very close to you to get any coolness4. The water only lasts 4hrs,2
It being to squeals badly after about 6 months of use.,2
"It's an okay unit, tales awhile to get cool air out of the unit and the fan isn't very strong even at max.",2
"Customer Service is Priority ONE with this company--A principal from the company personally called me for feedback on the cooler. I experienced what I thought was an incomplete assembled cooler, but after speaking with the principal/owner, it was apparent they made significant improvements to the unit to allow ice to be used in the water, which cools the air about 30 degrees more than normal. Their fan motors are of superior quality, sealed units. I live in Phoenix, AZ where summer temps are record breaking at 118 degrees, we use our Cajun Kooler coupled with our mister system so we can enjoy being outside on the patio. This unit is superior to others we've tried, and I highly recommend it.",2
haven't used yet,2
"This is a cheaply made unit but it works okay for what it is.Before my actual review, I wanted to mention the ice packs because a lot of reviews complain about them. Yes, the ice packs melt quickly. You'll need to keep a few and rotate them through the freezer if you want consistent ice packs. This is not a product flaw. It's just physics. Putting something frozen in water- a heat sink- makes it melt faster than when just on a surface.Now for my actual product feedback.The air that comes out of it, even without ice packs, is definitely cooler than the air that comes out of an ordinary fan.It isn't strong enough to really significantly cool a space, but for a very small space or for the area immediately in front of it, it works reasonably well. It will be much more effective in an arid climate than in a humid one. To counteract this in the humid area I live in, I simultaneously run a dehumidifier.I had it for about 2 days with it working quite well with constant use. Partway through the third day, it started to leak pretty badly. I opened it up and tightened all the internal screws I could reach, then closed it again. Unfortunately, the leak continues. I will be returning this and trying a different model that is hopefully made better.",2
It doesn’t get really cold!,2
"This cooler is not bad, it just doesn’t cool 1100 square feet! Not even close. It’s actually 1100 CUBIC square feet which is not even a 12’x12’x8’ room. (1152 cu ft) The advertising is misleading. It also takes distilled water so the deposits and minerals don’t clog it up. Amazon has 18 gallons for over $60 so that will get you less than 30 hours. If you have a small room or you put that thing right on you, it’s not much better than a good fan.",2
It was working great but the pump diedIn 4 months,2
"The water tank and the ice things. This thing really aint worth it. Just take the plan and you get a portable ac unit Because this thing it works somewhat, but honestly not enough",2
"As the headline said, the boom mic introduces echo and buzzing, the exact opposite of what I'd intended by buying a more expensive headset. Plus, they only record at 16 bit, 48KHz, well below anything reasonable. Save your money and buy a $5 headset if you want the boom mic, because this one simply isn't fit for purpose. The only bright side is the comfort and the audio out, but the difference of $35 between this and the boom-mic headset I got at 5 Below isn't justified for that.",2
"Never mishandled, but after a year of use the microphone only works when placed at a certain angle now and is very inconvenient.",2
The only real issue with the stand is the shaft and piece the headphones rests on. Its very poor quality. I super glued it together and it lasted another couple of weeks before it broke again with simple use. Spend your money elsewhere.,2
Hooked into A40TR and my voice cuts out very frequently to others I am talking to.,2
"This headset didn’t connect with my xbox what so ever, even though it says it is, would be perfect for anything else though",2
"This is a good looking and useful headphone stand but the RGB stopped working after 2 days of use. Already tried to unplug and plug it again, no luck, holding the rgb button, no luck. It just stopped working and it's disappointing after so little use. If I want to return the item I would have to send it with an international courier service because I'm not located in USA, so shipping it back would cost to me like double the cost of the actual item.",2
This is the 2nd one I have purchased and believed it was identical to the other one. There is no mute option. Don't recommend if your kid games as muting is something they all do.,2
Stop working after one day,2
"This headset is comfortable, the audio is good, the battery life is good. I really like that the mic flips up and down and mute itself when you do so. All the things you think about with a headset are on point. I wish I could end the review there, but everything else makes this thing a pain to use.The main reason I went with this is because I already use some other Corsair peripherals with iCUE. Using this headset with iCUE is actively worse than without. First and foremost, when you're not using iCUE, the headset uses a series of beeps to for audio feedback when you mute or unmute. These beeps are very clear, and they vary in tone in a manner that makes it intuitive whether what you just did was to mute or unmute. These beeps sound whether you click the physical mute button or flip the mic up or down. When the headset is controlled by iCUE, these beeps are completely disabled, and you're left with two options: No mute sounds at all, or use the extremely grating voice prompts. Why can't I just hear the beeps? It makes no sense.You can replace the voice prompt audio with your own .WAV files, but what you'll find is that iCUE has a something like a half-second delay in reading custom .WAV files, and even if there wasn't, there's no active audio connection. The audio connection only starts when audio plays, and it takes an additional half-second *after* audio starts for anything to get to the headset, so it cuts off the first half of the audio. In practice, this means if you have a second long audio clip, you'll only hear half of it. If you have a half-second long audio clip, you'll hear nothing. Why send audio feedback through the audio channel instead of playing them natively on the headset? It makes no sense.Note that this is through the USB dongle with a dedicated connection to the headset. I understand that the various versions of Bluetooth will have these latency and cut-off issues, and that's the main reason why I chose this headset that comes with a dongle. Why does the dongle have the same issues that Bluetooth does? Does the dongle use Bluetooth for its connection? If so, then *what is the point of the dongle*? All phones, all laptops, all consoles, and most desktop PCs (mine included) have Bluetooth built-in. Why ship a dongle that has all the downsides of not having a dongle? It makes no sense.Also, when connected through the dongle, infrequently (but extremely noticeably) something goes completely wrong and the microphone audio just totally corrupts. I haven't had the pleasure of hearing it myself, but multiple times have the people I'm talking to started freaking out about how I was getting sucked into a wormhole. When this happens, it doesn't stop, and the only way to get the audio back in working order is to unplug and replug the dongle. Turning the headset off and back on doesn't even work. I don't know if it's a driver issue or what, but I can't risk a losing customer or client trust because my hardware just fails in the middle of something.So throw the dongle out, right? Just use Bluetooth natively. Yeah, I tried that too. The latency issues with the headset are much worse than what I see with other Bluetooth devices, outside of my $5 set of earbuds. This thing is $50 ($100 with the dongle that makes the experience worse), they couldn't have put a better Bluetooth module in it? I've used no-name speakers with better Bluetooth. Why put inferior components in your mid-range device? I'd say it makes no sense, but it's really just cost cutting at the expense of consumers who don't know any better. (Un)Fortunately for me, I do know better.And one last issue, and last because this might just be my system, but when the headset is connected via Bluetooth, Windows Audio Service uses upwards of 5 GB of RAM and some 10-15% of CPU on my 13th Gen Intel i7. I don't see other connected devices, audio or otherwise, using this amount of resources. On top of that, the headset broadcasts itself as multiple different devices, presumably one to connect to the dongle and one (or more?) to connect via native Bluetooth. This makes it really hard to isolate and troubleshoot any issues, because it's not easy to tell if you need to look at ""CORSAIR HS55 WIRELESS Gaming Headset"" or ""CORSAIR HS55 Stereo"" or ""CORSAIR HS55 WIRELESS HANDS-FREE AG"" or whatever else in device manager or sound settings.I put up with all these issues for a month, swapping between connection methods, trying different settings, googling workarounds, convincing myself that there must be a way to make this thing good. After a month, I have found that there is not. There's no way to use this thing that isn't aggressively bad in one way or another. I wish I could pick and choose different aspects of the different connection methods and combine them into a singular, cohesive, and broadly good experience, but it's not possible. And since the return window closes after 30 days, I guess I'll just be out the cash with a bad product that could be good but isn't. If this is the sort of experience I can expect from Corsair, then I guess I know not to get any further invested in the ecosystem.",2
"The media could not be loaded. I bought this yesterday (4/30/23), when I originally plugged it in and set it all up it worked. Today when I set my controller on it the lights in the bar went absolutely insane. I didn’t think much about it and was gone all day. I came back to my controller not charged and the lights still going crazy. I took it off the charger and the lights work fine. I put my controller on it and crazy lights… my phone won’t even charge anymore when plugged into it. Really annoyed, and will be contacting customer service.Update: I got in contact with the company who makes these and they sent me a new one free of charge… I’ve had it 24/hours and it’s working okay. It’s a little wonky when I set my controller down it freaks out but after about 5 minutes it works like normal.. I will give it some more time before I change my review completely or keep it the same. It was nice if the company to send me a new one though.",2
"Received console and accessories as advertised in the description to replace a similar previous refurbished system that was sent back. Upon trying to power up system after making proper connections, found that the controller would not work. Sent everything back for a refund.",2
"Haven’t played the game hooked it up to my TV. Can’t seem to make the controller compatible to the game. It came with the game, but for some reason it’s acting like it’s not compatible so I haven’t played it.",2
The product is not good,2
This item came in the color was distorted. It looks more navy blue and white. Did not look anything like the black-and-white picture shown online.,2
"The paper was very wrinkled and creased and was delivered folded. It would have been packaged with a sturdy piece of cardboard. The paper was also extremely thin (paper meets tissue paper). If the papers were not wrinkled and creased it would have made a decent placemat, but in its current state it looked cheap and I ended up throwing away so many sheets because I couldn't use them for anything.",2
These look cheap. Colors are not realistic. We chose not to use them for our event.,2
"Pros - Placemats are colorful and seem sturdy. Cons - Dozens of errors in the maps. Problems with places being misnamed, colors (sometimes contiguous countries have the same color), the names of cities are larger than the names of states or countries. Names are cut off so you can't read them. These placemats useless for teaching geography, but we are having a lot of fun spotting and discussing errors!",2
Lifeless colors. Returned. Previously a fan of Pimpernel.,2
"Product has edges peeling up after a few weeks, and very difficult to keep these glossy mats looking clean. Poor quality.",2
"Nice print, it is very thin, I don’t think is going to last long, I will have to iron it because it came with wrinkles. Not that happy with them, it looks better in picture",2
Really cheap and thin,2
Product is totally not a placemat. More a coaster!!!! If I was bothered I would return them but as I am incapacitated with a back problem they will be used as very expensive candle base to protect furniture. So disappointed. Just wouldn’t buy them ever!!,2
"Experienced serious performance issues which prompted me to return the product. The issues all involved the Chrome browser. Clicking links on pages, creating new tabs and generally doing anything on the browser stuttered and paused. No other processor intensive activity was taking place, the only thing open was the Chrome browser. The issue went away after a while but I wasn't taking any chances. The experience was so disappointing and I was wary of it happening again that I decided that it was simply best to just return the item.",2
I hardly use the darn thing be it drives me crazy! I needed a new laptop and right now Apple was out of my price range. I am so over & done with windows so this seemed like a nice option. It is very printer fussy. It would work with the one I had but it gave a list of printers that would. I ordered one from that list. Nope. Wouldn't work. I wanted a lighted keyboard. I didn't know that the only lighted keyboard was the touch screen one that insists on popping up constantly when I'm using the other (unlit) keyboard. I really prefer the raised keys of a keyboard over touchscreen for typing. It has some nice features. Holds a charge well. Will store your info so you don't need to enter it yourself but most computers do that. The screen size is nice. But the negatives far outweigh the positives for me. I regret the purchase.,2
"I purchased this unit and really enjoyed it. Even though it was bigger than i normally use, i was going to keep it anyway but unfortunately relentless wifi issues made me return it. Constant disconnects from anything requiring a reliable connection. Amazon luna constantly kicked me out, geforce now and xcloud both had constant disconnects. I couldnt get through a 20 minute zoom meeting without a dozen reconnects. I have other devices, including chromebooks that dont have any issues with my internet. Being a chromebook means i cant swap for another wifi chip leaving me to return. Perhaps it was only my unit but truly unfortunate.",2
"It’s a great buy for the price. There’s no debating that. However, no manual included. I bought it posted as excellent condition. Nothing could be further from the truth. Many scratches on both sides of the keyboard. Surface scratches on the lid. I can actually live with that. Looked like a big dirt stain in the exact middle of the screen. Nope it’s a ding and it’s deep enough to fit the tip of your fingernail. The fact that it actually works is the only thing stopping me from giving one star. I was under the impression this was from Amazon but it’s an individual seller. I’m okay with that but maybe some more transparency and honesty would have me in a better mood",2
"This is advertised as having 64GB storage plus a 64GB MicroSD for a total of 128GB storage. It does come with a MicroSD card and an SD adapter, but there is no place to plug either one in. The instruction sheet shows a location for inserting the card, but that slot does not exist on the computer we received.",2
It arrived without the charger.,2
"This thing was a pain in the neck to set up any software not purchased at the “Microsoft Store.” Even programs that were pre-loaded on the system as purchased could not be activated or accessed without knowledge of how to access the magic handshake that Microsoft support would not provide. I had to go to individual software providers such as McAfee and Adobe to figure out how to enable commonly used programs. Even setting up an existing HP printer was not for the meek..everything defaults through HP’s cloud and, again, no support from HP to enable local print spooling. The speed and user interface is no better than the 8 y.o. Windows 10 system I replaced (forced obsolescence, because Windows 10 won’t be supported past 2025 and many programs already could not be updated). Then there’s this flash-card approach to local storage…what a cheesy way to force users to buy storage space in the cloud. Now I know why iOS and Google based systems are more expensive and likely worth the premium.",2
"This is a very nice and powerful laptop for the price, working well and fast, battery life is not great but fine if you adjust the power setting.The add implies that MS office is included in the laptop, however it is only installed, to use it you can get 30 days free trial (by putting your CC info) but than you must pay.This misleading product info really leaves a bitter taste from this purchase. As a consumer I just want to get what was advertised, nothing less nothing more.",2
"Just like the reviews of this laptop- the hinge cover was missing! As this is for a 13 year old, I am not sure that I want to keep it. With the missing piece, it makes me wonder how long this will last. I gave it two stars because it powers on quickly.",2
I never turned it on or tried charging it. A piece is missing,2
This is the slowest and loudest Chromebook I've ever owned. It will shutdown at random the fan is constantly on. I've not altered the system in any way. I stick to regular updates and maintain recommended security protocols. Super disappointed.,2
"The only good about this chromebook is the Intel Evo 5 processor, the rest is us a Chrome web browser. All android apps will run in phone or tablet mode, but not in full screen. For the money this latptop cost, you can buy two lenove tablet P12 and will have all the same functionaity plus all your apps will run in full screen mode, plus the same browser experience. Chromebook is bulky and abttery life no good at all.",2
"I purchased this after seeing an embroidery digitizer use it in a video online. One of the well-known digitizing software companies even recommends it on its site. While the reviews online seem to vary, I figured at this price it was worth a shot.It arrived quickly. The packaging is okay, though if it had been included in a box with something heavy, I would have concerns about it being protected well enough.The instructions it came with were insufficient at best. They basically say to insert a battery, plug in the dongle to your computer, and the pen will automatically connect as it was paired at the factory. There are no markings on the inside of the pen or in the instructions to tell you which direction to insert the battery.Despite our technical knowledge, neither my husband nor I were able to get this pen to connect to any computer in our household. The wireless mouse I purchased the same day worked just fine though, so that leads me to believe it was a problem with the pen.Holding the pen felt unnatural to me. It's oddly shaped, probably for ergonomics, but it fails in this way.Perhaps others have had better luck, but this is going back and I'll have to do further research on a digital pen.",2
"I have to tap several times or really smash with my index finger to get the to work. Using it properly, by using thumb for left click and pinky for right click is impossible.",2
Keep in a drawer for when the cat chews the cord on your normal keyboard to order another normal keyboard.,2
Cheap. Sits crooked. The water doesn't make a dripping sound like it should. It doesn't come out of the top strongly to create A solid stream. It just dribbles out. Very disappointed.,2
"Worked beautifully for a few months, and then kept slowing down until the ball just finally stopped turning altogether. It also started leaking and I was afraid of damage to my furniture, so I disposed of it. A shame--it was a beautiful fountain.",2
"This fountain is beautiful. It is VERY cheaply made, which is why it's a bit confusing on the cost. There is no adjuster for the water flow, no on/off switch (you have to unplug to turn on/off), no adjuster for the led lights. It's a beautifully sculpted piece of plastic. That's it.I have another fountain that has LED's with a remote. You can utilize it as a diffuser and the remote turns the power on/off and controls the water. I paid $5 under the cost of this thing. Contemplating a return due to lack of value. My struggle - the design is poetic to me. For now, just writing a review. I'll see how annoyed I get plugging/unplugging this thing when I leave my office daily.",2
"Was definitely disappointed, and mostly shocked taking it out the box to see how small it was . Even more disappointed cause I couldn’t really hear the sound of the waterfall which is why I bought it.",2
It is So tiny. Its embarrassing small!!Hard yo find a place it won't look ridiculous,2
I'm on a hunt now for a new water fountain. This one just splashes water too much that I need to keep adding water to it 2-3 times a day. The splashes ruined the wooden table I had it on. Find another one. This one is beautiful but loud and too high maintenance.,2
"It’s a nice fountain and works great. But somehow I have to add water 2x per day or the globe stops spinning. It’s not leaking, so not sure why it takes so much water.",2
Motor is too loud .. not worth the cost.. pretty fountain but the motor’s sound is louder than the water sound,2
It was very noisy from the beginning and had to try putting rocks in it for the water to hit. Now after 4 months its broke.,2
Nice little fountain but the LED colors die quickly. The red light is the only one in the rotation that still works and I haven’t even had it a full month.Update: stopped working well after maybe 2 months. Tried it tonight and the motor started making a loud whining noise. Was really nice for the first couple of weeks but quality went down really fast.,2
It worked fine the first few days. Then the motor started making this high pitched whining sound and I found the water level had dissipated extremely fast. So now I can only leave it on for a few hours before the motor starts whining again. I liked the colors and spinning ball but now I wish I had kept the box to return it. Also an on/off switch would be nice. 2 stars for the colors and the ball,2
beautiful but does not have the rubber sleeve.,2
Sent it back the same day I recieved it and didn't re order. I believe I received a defective device. Didn't work when I plugged it in🤷🏽‍♀️,2
It looks good but when you try to turn it on the pump does work but we put enough water in it to get it to work look the way it should like in the pictures it just stops working,2
"I've had this fountain for 2 months. It was a great little desktop fountain. I love the sound that comes from it. Unfortunately, the top piece became unglued and now it doesn't work properly. I was hoping for more than 2 months of use.",2
"This looks great, is nice and compact, and relatively quiet. However, the way the fountain is designed leaves almost no margin for error. It worked great for maybe a week until the pump became slightly weaker, and because the water does not quite make it to the meshed section it just splashes all over the bottom surface and all over the counter. Essentially useless. I mitigated this by putting a little ramp so the water does not splash when it hits, but I absolutely do not believe the pump is high quality at all. I mean, what do you expect for $40, but still...disappointing. Hopefully you'll just get one where the pump works properly for a long time, instead of failing almost immediately, relatively speaking.",2
"Can not hear the waterfall at all. Completely quiet! Very disappointed in no sound of running water. Very stingy with Rocks not enough to completely cover the bottom. Would return, but too much trouble! Thanks anyway",2
"While it is very beautiful and complemented my spa very well, it stopped working after 1 month. Randomly this week it turned off by itself and after I cleaned and inspected it, the light doesn't turn on anymore and the motor also stopped working. I am disappointed as I had high hopes for this.",2
"After 10 months now, fountain has stopped working. I had been cleaning it periodically as it would build up some gunk. But now after once again cleaning, using vinegar, etc. Tried taking it apart, but it doesn't really come apart other than at top cup which is where I would use a small brush. But, alas, It no longer works. Off to the trash.My cats love drinking from a fountain and when old one died after several years, had to replace. This one is perfect size. It has pleasant sound, tho I removed the bell. Can adjust flow and lights to your preference. Good value.",2
"This fountain is beautiful and works great at first! I got mine towards the end of February and it only last me about 3 months before the pump died. I used clean, filtered water and cleaned it out. I also ensured that the proper water levels were kept up and it quit working out of nowhere.",2
"The fountain is nice, but the water pump died after 1 day of running. Disappointed!",2
"I wanted this for the calming water noise but it's too quiet on the medium setting, doesn't pump water at all on the low and the water splashes out when you run it on high for any extended amount of time. It looks great but doesn't fit my needs.",2
Wouldn't fool anyone with its cheap plastic appearance; didn't like at all. Also too lightweight; could get knocked over very easily if you have a cat or dog.,2
The paint they use started to peal off and make water slimy. I only used filtered water for about 2 weeks and water was thick and gooey. When I tried rinsing the whole thing I saw the paint was peeling right off.This also does not make any water sound with the rolling ball in it. It is completely silent. I had to use it without the ball to produce some water sound effect.,2
"Didn't realize it was all plastic, that is on me since it says it in the details. I guess you get what you pay for. The design is annoying, you need to make sure you setup the pump level to what works best for you realizing that any level has a hum that you will hear and its not the white noise hum people can sleep to. if you need to make any change then you have to remove all the rocks, pull up the base , empty the water, make your change and put it all back again. the instructions were poorly lit so they are not very helpful and step 4 says the bead light is for another hole, but then doesn't tell you which hole. When you do figure it out, there is nothing for the light to connect to, you will end up having to glue it into the hole but then that means you have to reglue it every time you need to take it apart. I would suggest going to a one of those niche stores and picking one up already assembled that you can inspect before purchase.",2
"The media could not be loaded. First time I ordered item -water pump motor quit after 10 days. Also as shown in video, floating marble gave rather jarring light as opposed to peacefulThere is no on/off switch on cord either. One would need to unplug directly at outlet. Ordered replacement which quit working after 2 days. Will choose another company for next order.",2
Got this for my wife she had it plugged in for about 2 weeks and then started to leak and is progressly getting worse.,2
"This is as beautiful as you would expect it, just like in the pictures. Easy to install. All good until you plug it in.. damn it, the noise the little motor makes totally covers the soothing sound of the dripping water with defeats the purpose. I will return unfortunately..Update: On a positive note, I just discovered that if I leave it on, after a while the noise subsides, and it actually sounds the way it should.HOWEVER, I just discovered a huge water mark on my desk underneath where the fountain sat. This thing ruined my desk, unfortunately. While getting it ready to return it, after it dried, I noticed that the bottom had a crack that was attempted to be fixed but it didn't seal properly so it leaked big time. Just so you know, I didn't purchase a refurbished product, or used. It was supposed to be a brand new product. Which came with a poorly fixed crack. I'm not trusting this brand going forward!",2
This is the second one we bought. It was replacing the same one we bought before. The first one the motor finally died but we did have it for awhile. The second one completely rusted.,2
Cheesy sent it back,2
I was impressed by the looks and quality but I could not hear the water.I tried different suggestions but still had to put my ear up to it to hear the water flow. There were plenty of rocks which others said there was little.,2
"At first the fountain works perfectly, the pump was silent. But after a while, 3 hrs, it started to make a low humming noise even when the water level was almost full. I checked the pump and realised it was overheating. Sadly, I am not sure what cause this issue",2
"Loved this fountain until it just decided that it didn’t want to roll the ball anymore, so I removed it and used it for about a month after and now it doesn’t work at all. I kept it clean and used as directed and now it’s a goner . I wouldn’t recommend",2
"I loved this fountain when it arrived, water flowed beautifully, the sound was magic, like a river in my living room, the water didn't evaporate quickly so i wasn't constantly refilling. I've had it since June 2024, then about a week ago i started hearinf that noise pumps make when there isn't enought water, I quickly filled it with filtered water and the next morning i heard it again and saw water had seeped down my cabinet and was soaking it, i moved it to the kitchen to see what was happening and sure enough, water is just leaking out of the seams, 3 months of use isn't worth it, look for a better quality fountain, it is pretty and sounded great, but now it's useless.",2
"This is a pretty fountain, though it makes no noise at all. However, there is no hose to connect the pump to the base of the fountain, so you have to just sort of shove the pump to the end of the tube awkwardly diagonally, which means it works, but the reservoir has to be completely full to even reach the pump, and the plate sits on top of the reservoir wobbly and crooked because the pump is in the way. Not impressed.",2
"It was a nice fountain but the back opening was so small that every time I cleaned the inside when the fountain no longer pumped efficiently, I had to spend 30 minutes just to put the clear tube back in place onto the pump. And that didn't guarantee the water would flow properly either. I even cut my finger once. For other fountains I've had before, you could easily lift the top to clean and replace the water with ease. Maintaining a fountain should not be this effortful and difficult. In the end, I donated it to Goodwill because it was simply too time-consuming and frustrating for me. I learned that I will never get another tabletop fountain with a small opening at the back no matter how nice it looks!",2
It was nice for 2 days than the mist stopped working. Very disappointed,2
"I had high hopes for this but unfortunately this only worked well for 4 months before it started to deteriorate and ultimately stopped working. The arms tend to fall off whenever handled or cleaning out your bird bath. The attachments are great however the pump is pretty strong and unless you have a large fountain or pond, the water shoots up too high and the wind blows the water away from landing back in your bird bath. Had to use one of the weaker attachments and didn't get the water trickle sound I was looking for. Overall, this product has a short life span in my experience.",2
This worked when the sun was on it. But not for long with in months it doesn't work at all. ☹️,2
"First, when I received this, it was missing the instructions, missing the piece that keeps it centered, and only came with 2 nozzles. It's pretty straight forward. You find a bright sunny location and submerge it in water and it starts working. That was awesome! I don't know why I didn't get one sooner. However, it was pretty frustrating trying to figure out how to keep it centered so that the the water didn't splash out everywhere. I had to refill it with water atleast twice a day. And because I've had other submersible pumps, I know how quickly they can get clogged. I couldn't figure out how to get the motor open to clean it out, because no instructions, and I didn't want to break it. But I did the best I could making sure it was cleaned out, daily or every other day. This pump totally stopped functioning within 2 weeks! I made sure the panel was clean so that it could receive full sun. There was nothing, that I could see blocking the motor. This was during a busy time for me and I missed the return window. I contacted the manufacturer through Amazon, with no response from them. So now I've wasted money on a pump that was probably a return, and doesn't work. Great concept. Just don't buy this one!",2
Without full sun it just sputters.,2
"It works well in full sun. However, if a cloud passes by, it shuts off. I was expecting it to run for a few minutes but it surely doesn't. I'm not even sure there is a battery and it may just be solar powered.",2
Motor was 1 watt instead of 3.5 watts as shown in product. Overall too light build quality. Costly for this build quality.0,2
"This is great while it works and makes the birds very happy! But there are two major problems. As other purchasers have noted, it only lasts for a few months and gives out. Also, it looks like it's made out of left over plastic junk and drink drinking straws, which may actually be the case. I am going to buy another bubbler, but it won't be this one.",2
"The media could not be loaded. The fountain doesn't work efficiently,spurting water intermittently ,no regular flow,despite full sunlight over it,replacement requested in hope of a fully working one.",2
"This fountain worked really well for about a month. We put it in a large clear tray that you would use for the bottom of a house plant. It was a very inexpensive bird bath for our desert yard and the birds loved it while it worked.The pump gets clogged very easily, which eventually leads to the pump failing. Maybe if you were to wash it off daily, it might last longer. We just didn't take the time to do this. We ended up purchasing a more expensive fountain that came with a filter and had a battery to work when the sun went down.",2
"The fountain was quick and easy to assemble and started working right away, but it quit working after only a few days.",2
"The power only lasted as long as the sun was shining directly on the pump. The output was pretty low. I put this in a bird bath and did not need much of a flow, but it just spit some water occasionally. I placed it where it would get the most sun, but as soon as the sun would not be direct or a cloud would pass over, it stopped. Not what I expected and I did return it. I will try a different one. I went with this one because it was so cheap. I will try a pricier one and see what happens.",2
"Easy to set up, looked great, then died after 5-6 weeks",2
"We were so happy with this product and even though the instructions stated it would need full sun it ran without complete sunlight, until one day it just stopped working. Asked for a replacement from the company but have not had a response.",2
"We bought this in May and it worked great for a couple months.. But now it is dead. We have tried all the suggestions of cleaning filter, shaking, submerging in water and making sure it’s not in the shade. I loved it while working but sorry we spent money for short lived enjoyment.",2

"This pump worked very well, so well in fact that I couldn't use a spry head or it would blow out the water with the slightest breeze. I took off the head and it worked fine. Then, one day I went out and there was almost no flow. Ok, I guess I need to clean the sponge filter. I did so, reassembled it, and ........nothing!This is a great pump if you need it for a few weeks for a special occasion, but otherwise, no dice. Too bad as the solar panel is large and worked well. All I NEED IS Q NEW PUMP, not the tubing or solar panel, but I can't buy just the pump. I've purchased this two times and no bueno either time. Ok, I tried one last time to clean it.I brought it in and removed the sponge filter, yes, it is nothing like the picture to clean. You can't remove anything except a small piece of porous sponge. I removed that and cleaned as much as I could, then took a toothbrush to the ""frame' that holds it, and when I put it back together, voila, it worked again. So the solar collector is great, the pump is meh, and the filter system is the weakest link. I anticipate cleaning the sponge filter about two more times before it falls apart. Without it, the particulates will get sucked into the pump, causing failure since you can't get to the pump motor. I know this is not a 1/4 horse pond pump but a little better filter, or cleaning access would go a long way to the longevity of this pump! I'll change my star level from 1 to 2.",2
"worked well for a couple of months - provided entertainment for folks who saw it.We cleaned it regularly and followed instructions but sadly it has failed, the motor is now longer either working or getting power from the transformer.This is just another cheap piece of equipment symbolic of modern consumerism.",2
"The fountain was quick and easy to assemble and started working right away, but it quit working after only a few days.",2
"There were lots of instructions, but none clearly indicating that the part with suction cups was supposed to line up under the little opening in the middle...suction cups down.It was a very sunny day. The pump was working full tilt; the stream of water went up 6-8"" above the surface.Some splashed out of the birdbath and the rest must have evaporated because within a few hours, the water in the birdbath was too low to pump water.Next I'll look for a spot shady enough for it to work but with less vigor.",2
I was disappointed with the fountain. When there was complete full sun it would work but let a cloud go over head and it would stop. Even if I walked by it the pump would shut off. I also had trouble with the suction cups holding it in place. They were constantly coming loose.,2
"The media could not be loaded. I was very excited when I ordered this product, not so much after I received it! Lights barely worked the first night, they don’t work at all now. water does not work at night. It only works during the day if it’s sunny (thankfully I live in Fla..lol) Solar power to me means it powers during the day with the sun and has power to work when no sun but I guess not. We bought a bird bath for it and the water lasts about 2 hrs…. You have to constantly fill it. I unfortunately just don’t recommend.",2
"The media could not be loaded. The price was right and it shipped fast. There were minimal directions for assembly, but pretty self explanatory. Comes with a variety of fountain tips - which all do pretty much the same thing. I created a small fountain so I didn't need a big spray. However, the biggest negative is that it spurts when there is not full sun. If a shadow is on the solar cell anywhere, it won't work. It will do for this little project but won't buy again.",2
"I like the idea...however, living in reality where clouds are a real thing, if you do not have 100% sun (no clouds, no shade), do not have high expectations. When there is full sun on the panel, it works well. Otherwise, it barely runs. There is no 'battery' that gets charged in case you do have a cloud or two so it all but stops running. The very irritating part though was the tubing provided does not fit the nozzle pieces. I wanted a solar pump to make a small bird bath/water decoration. I am having to constantly move the panel so it gets 100% sun, I had to get an adapter to use the nozzles, and not all of them work with the adapter, so I'm limited there as well. I figure I'll keep this for now, but certainly would not recommend it to anyone else and will likely have to find a better option at some point.",2
"I was happy with how it worked until it quit 3 weeks after using it. I maintained it daily, keeping it clean and and polished. It's a shame I can't get my money back.",2
Does not do much - too little water flow,2
"Was nice to start with, but was not made well and ceased to function soon after purchase.",2
I saw a couple of other customers who get the pulsating and not a full flow and I wish that you could set it out in the sun somewhere and charge it without the pump running. It is evident to me that there is no way for this to hold any charge. This is strictly on demand at the moment. Other fountains do have a means of storing sunlight but not this one does not.,2
"Truly not a fan of this solar fountain, wish I had returned it.It doesn't always work, the motor stops, sometimes the water just bubbles at the base of the sprayer.When it does work, it's very pretty",2
"Worked great initially; however, it stopped working last week, just outside of the 30 day return window.",2
Lasted about two months. Then nothing. Total disappointment,2
I put this fountain out at the beginning of June and it died the last week of August. I cleaned it regularly and made sure it never ran dry. It worked great until it didn’t. I would expect it to last at least one Ohio summer. Very disappointing.,2
"Good points include the accessories, nozels, hose and compact packaging and, unfortunately, a simple returns process. When it did work it managed to pump about 30-40cm head (height from the pump).Bad points: it only worked on full summer sun, clouds made it cut out. Came back the following day to see if there was any improvement - totally dead; sent for returns and will be looking for something a bit bigger.",2
Lasted for about 2 months😡,2
I purchased four of these pumps and returned 3 of them because I need detachable cords for my project. The pumps arrived quickly and my refund was very prompt. I kept one and used it for about a month when it simply just quit working.,2
My fountain quit working a week ago!I want a refund on this item.,2
"I ordered a all black coloured fountain and received black and grey, plus it is not working as well as another fountain I ordered from Amazon....disappointed!Marie :(",2
WORKS GREAT IF THERE'S FULL SUN ON IT....ANY CLOUDS AT ALL FORGET IT. ONE OF THE HOLES ON THE SIDE FOR THE PLASTIC TUBES WAS TO SMALL COULDN'T GET TUBE INTO IT. IT WORKS GREAT IF YOU HAVE A FULL SUN KIND OF DAY BUT THE SLIGHTEST LITTLE BIT OF CLOUD IT JUST SPITS OUT THE WATER.,2
Another disappointment from this company,2
"I put this in a 20 gallon tank set in the ground in my garden, wanting to keep the water aerated to prevent yuck. I didn't like that the solar panel is separate, but I was able to easily place it and run the power line from outside the tank to the center, where I placed it on a rock.The pump only works when the sun is out fully, so on cloudy days and evenings not much happened. And then by late fall, about 6 months later, it just quit altogether. No clogs, and the light comes on, but it simply no longer works.Might be worth spending a little more money on a different product, which I have just done.",2
"Only one of the two fountains worked and the other barely works in full sun. Actually, i think it just stopped. Stay far away. Read the reviews.",2
The “rotation nozzle” is stationary. No lights at all. Ripoff!,2
It only works in direct sunlight. When area becomes shaded in afternoon the fountain stops working. When it is working it spurts less than 1/2 inch. Very disappointed. I trashed it after 3 months.,2
"The pump had plenty of power but the attachments would not stay attached. The Mushroom attachment would slowly come unscrewed as the water flowed and eventually comes off after a few minutes. Not all the pieces fit together correctly either. The extension tube would shoot right out of the pump because there was nothing to keep it tightened. 2 Stars because the pump is fine, but paying twice as much for the attachments is not worth it.",2
"Unfortunately this one is going in the trash since I can’t use it for my application - a pool circulation pump. Might be good for someone but beware it doesn’t seem to have rust resistance coating in the impeller.+ PLUSSES +* It pumps well - pushes a lot of water- MINUSES* Rust - But why would you design a WATER PUMP that isn’t protected against rust?? I tried using it as a pump for a pool but it just spews out brown rust water every time you turn it on.* noise - it’s quite loud. Not crazy loud but louder than I expected. Not sure how loud a pump like this should be but it has a high pitch whine.~ Neutral ~* Finish/craftsmanship. I didn’t put this as a minus since most people don’t really care what their pump looks like. I was surprised at how cheap this think looked. This makes Harbor Freight look like a luxury brand. The paint looks like it was a rattle can job - can scratch it off with fingernail. Hard to describe but metal parts are super thin, parts should have been cleaned up after molding/casting, etc. Just little attention to detail.* Wiring - you need to be able to wire this yourself, which may be difficult for some but clearly states in the description.",2
"The concept is great, but the time it was active was very short, so we were really disappointed!",2
It’s been a year and I have gone through 2 sets of the LEDS! I have them set on a timer to come on at 8pm and off at 1am and I’ve gone through 2 sets already!For the money I would expect the LEDs to last longer!! Total waste of money! Not happy!!!!,2
"Cute little fountain! But, you must keep it in direct sunlight to work. It doesn't shoot more than 6 inches in the air regardless of the noozle you use. Night feature is ok - wish you could control colors. You get what you pay for with this one.",2
The handle broke before I even got it out of the box. Seems a little sketchy already,2
"The fountains were beautiful and exactly what we’d hoped for. They worked the day before the wedding, but the wedding night there was nothing at all. No light and no water. Switches were triple checked. Charging instructions were followed. Battery back-up was the entire point of buying this model. Very, very disappointing.",2
It will only work at direct sun light. If you block the sun a second later it will stop working. This means that there is no built in battery as advertised. Other wise it would have not stopped working when i blocked the sun but would have continued working s long as the battery has some charge. But it doesnt so false advertising no battery is built in this.,2
"Quality is not that high, rollers are weak",2
"I loved the color and got many compliments on it.HOWEVER, I had issues with the wheels and steering the luggage. The wheels were difficult to control the suitcase through the airport. The zipper inside the small suitcase also was messed up.",2
This product is not sturdy nor durable. I used it only one trip and the wheel broke as well as part of the suitcase that left a large gap. The hard shell dented. Hard shell suit cases should withstand the rigorous transfer and transport. These do not.,2
The biggest luggage moves to the side by itself. It needs to be controlled with both hands. It defeats the purpose of the 360 degrees wheel,2
thought that the quality of the suitcases would be a little more sturdy. pretty flimsy. Sorry,2
The medium-sized one had completely fallen apart after 2 months - 2 trips. The handle stopped staying up after one trip & now the main zipper has completely broken. Very disappointed.,2
Wheels broke on both the medium and large luggage. Difficult to get back home from travel. Are there replacement wheels????,2
I expected a little more from this brand. The case fits so well and protects the phone. The sides of this case discoloured within the first two weeks of using and now looks very average. Would not purchase again.,3
The set is fine overall for the price. The metal on all knives is rather thin and somewhat flexible. Not the best quality but suitable for home use. The wood block holds all the knives but maybe could have been a darker wood. Like previously mentioned for the price its fine. How they will hold up is a test of time.,3
"This is the lamest product design ever. It does not store easily as advertised because all the stuff that comes with it doesn't fit in it. Not even the manual! I couldn't even figure out how to get it back in the box it came in. So now I have to buy a box to put it all in, so I don't lose pieces and parts. Very, very, very disappointed. This problem could have been easily avoided with a better design for the product, or if they included a plastic box just big enough to store everything in.The cutting area is pretty small, so you have to cut your produce or whatever in half or so, so that it will fit on the cutting area and you can close the unit to do the cutting. Again, lame!!! Again, the problem could be easily avoided by making the product larger in general. That said, it does cut as advertised, at least with the ""garnish blade"".I bought this specifically for making Pico. That means using the small and maybe the large dicing blades. The goal was to have a quicker and easier way to do it, rather than using my big kitchenaid mixer with the food processing attachment. That device does a wonderful job by the way, but our kitchen is very small so my wife makes me store it in the basement. My goal with THIS product was to have something I could keep in the kitchen cabinet.I didn't have everything I needed to make pico tonight, so I used it to make fajitas. I cut onions and three different kinds of peppers with it. For the onion, I had to cut that in half to make it fit in the cutting area so it would cut. For the big bell peppers, I had to cut them in half, and then in half then other way. I really expected better.Overall, the plastic is decent quality for the purpose, as far as I can tell. It also cleaned up fairly easily.I can't comment on its various other functions yet, as I just got the thing yesterday! But that didn't stop Amazon from asking for a review, so here it is.",3
"The product is not heavy but still will serve the purpose for our event. However, no screws were included and need to find replacements.;",3
Came dented and didn’t have enough time before my gathering to get a new one. Otherwise it works fine,3
"I expect a fluffy quilt. This is a flat blanket, nothing more.",3
"I love the scent, but the scent didn’t last. I’ve shaken it and added more stick, flipping everyday. I wish it was better.",3
The media could not be loaded. The color and shelf itself is pretty. I expected to be sturdier for prize. The concept is smart but they needed to add possibly another bar within the shelf to actually support better. Limited use for shelf because when adding additional items the shelf starts to lower in front part and looks like items will fall off and it’s not flush against the wall. I expected more considering price. Very cute design and great if hanging lighter items then books or albums. Great if for Knick knacks. Would not repurchase for my intended use.,3
"When I saw this online, I thought it was cute and decided to buy this as a Christmas gift for my in-laws. However, after receiving it, I don’t think the quality is too good and I’m really disappointed in the magnets. The concept is nice, but the magnets I received are all marked up and chipped. Very disappointing.",3
It's a nice looking decoration. Plastic and smaller than expected. I should have read the complete description but skipped ahead when it was on sale.,3
A bit smaller than I expected,3
"It's a very good computer, very pleasing to the eye. The only problem I have with it is that it's incompatible with the windows 11 upgrade. I honestly thought I grabbed the windows 11 PC but unfortunately I didn't. Besides that little hiccup, it runs smoothly.",3
"Cpu cooler is bad but the pc is good value for the discount, also it is very difficult if you want to upgrade it since the specs are propierty",3
"It's good enough for gaming. RAM, not the best—you could buy more yourself. But looking back, given all of these components this thing is super overpriced. You could build your own for half the price with the same components. Either look for another product or just build your own.",3
For the customers: this is what you should know it does not have a Optical drive a.k.a. DVD player they should put that in the description saying it doesn’t have one but it’s not there it doesn’t say it does or doesn’t either way I want to use it for other things other than gaming the loads really fast in the Internet is really fast when it’s loaded the games take less time to download to my previous computer I played breath edge and it works fine just got hiccups here and there but you can upgrade.this the other problem is there’s no option or any way to put a optical drive in not a single port and that really ticks me off if you didn’t have one it should be advertise not having one and I would’ve went with the $600 one with the warranty about 700 which only had three fans and 250 Megabytes. The only other option is to go in a sternal optical drive a.k.a. DVD player CD player that’s also a pain in the ass you have to make sure that it’s able to read not just burn learned that the hard way make sure you read the descriptions and look for what is and what isn’t mentioned.To the manufacturer: this is borderline false advertisement you should really mention that it doesn’t have one if you’re not going to install it or even an option for someone who buys it to put one in themselves not everyone streams games online some people still get hardcopies that’s something to take in mine I don’t have a problem with the look I do have a problem with not seeing or mentioning certain things in your description for future references this would be best if an external hard drive doesn’t work I will be getting a full refund and I’m going with a different company very disappointed.,3
For old games 100% good but when you got some récent games you gonna surfer. But you know i run obs and my games Steel pretty descent bit it works,3
So everything arrived in time and everything worked BUT the monitor. Like the monitor flashes. Which is sad. My son got creative and used an old tv to connect everything. But keyboard quality is good and everything else but the monitor is good.,3
Looks good. Very compact. Does not upgrade and very limited in what games you can play.So i returned it. Still waiting for my refund. Was sent back over 1 month ago.,3
"I have the series S 500gig from when they came out. The 1tb unit should be just as fast “actually faster” to load since it’s a better read/write SSD BUT ITS NOT. Already tried to exchange it since the Xbox reb said it should run great but they would only exchange it with a refurb. And 90 day warranty when I payed for the year warranty but it’s not transferable or refundable. GOING TO STICK WITH PC GAMING, consoles are just not worth it.",3
It works plays the games but it does like to turn on its own when not it use. Has turned off on its own while using it but not when playing a game.other than that works great,3
"The build quality of this stand is excellent and the lights look great, there are just two issues with it. Firstly, this rubber appendage sticking out at me. I have a wireless mouse so have literally no use for this, I'm able to remove it but now have this ugly gaping hole instead. I may be able to ignore it or try and cover it, but for a premium stand this is a bit daft.However the most irritating problem is that the stand doesn't retain the colour I last set it to. I use a docking station and frequently switch between machines, and every time I do I have to keep pressing the button until I get back to my colour.It may sound like a petty complaint but this isn't the cheapest stand on the market and this is a really stupid problem to have. If my cheap and crappy £10 mousepad from China can do it then I don't see why this can't.",3
"For the price and renewed original Xbox Console, you might think you'd be getting a good deal. Little did I know that the pop-open tray couldn't slide out on the first day of gaming my favorite game, that being the ""Counter-Strike"" Shooter game for the Original Xbox. So I say to myself: either I leave the Disc inside the Xbox, play CS, and make a promise to myself not to break the disk tray even more. Turns out the console works, but no CD Pop-Out capability. Still works fine. Dare I remove that disc for a different game from the Disk tray, and I would be asking for a no longer working Xbox. however the good news I have to share with you all is that I can still play Counter-Strike on the renewed Xbox I ordered, but I can't play other games because I'm too afraid the tray might get stuck and possibly break. So a word to the wise ""If it's broken, but still works, then don't break it anymore."" I guess the Xbox has been around for a very long time. Meaning old products come with defects or some kind of technical problem that can't be fixed. But on a good note, Whenever I look at my turned off Xbox, and see the game controller connected to the console, I get the feeling it's telling me to load up Counter-Strike for one more round. Looking at it, makes me want to call this console, the Counter-Strike Xbox!",3
"After a few days with the phone, I can say that it's pretty sub-par. It's definitely a step up from my previous device, but I honestly expected more from a 5G Galaxy device in 2024.The camera is nice, and the body is solid. The screen is beautiful, visually, but is slow and unresponsive, at times refusing to register taps and swipes.I've owned Galaxy devices before, but the Samsung bloatware on this one takes the cake. Dozens of apps are preloaded that you'll have to either disable or uninstall to get some of the precious memory back, and OneUI is aggressively intrusive, causing compatibility and sign in issues with just about everything you want to use.I suppose this is a case of get-what-you-pay-for, but the user experience seems oddly frustrating, given the promised five years of support.This phone has reaffirmed that the Samsung device environment is not for me.",3
"Product arrived nicely packaged and not damaged with all parts in place. After I hooked everything up I went to open the disc tray and it would not open. This was the exact same issue I had on my previous Xbox 360. After fighting with the disc tray I was able to get open.Xbox would repeatedly “freeze” and become unresponsive. Only way to correct issue was to unplug power.Do yourself a favor and either don’t buy, or make sure you get a warranty. I was able to return mine and the seller was very easy to work with on the refund process.",3
Not enough storage to keep 10 games on it and expansion storage is as expensive as console and external hard drive you have to move games back and forth to play,3
"After purchasing the ""3 Tube"" lamp; I went on to get the ""Shark"" and the ""Jellyfish"" lamps and neither had the USB or battery power sources. Also they didn't have the touch button to change the colors. Still a cool little light sculptures but I got a definite sense of El Cheapo. If this doesn't bother you then go ahead with the purchase. For my use, the USB &a battery setup was a major consideration, and I probably would not have bought the other 2 had I known, but all 3 models were in the same product description.",3
This product looks nice but I find it too bright to be used as a night light. I could also not find a dimmer switch that worked to dim this lamp.,3
"His foot ripped off, leaking sand everywhere. No way to fix it.",3
"Was very hopeful that this product would reduce the coffee stains on my teeth. After applying the toothpaste and scrubbing and scrubbing, I couldn't get the purple off that had stained the tartar in between my teeth. It took a couple more intense sessions to fade the purple. There was some fading on the stains on the surface of the teeth but didn't want to look like a Halloween ghoul so did not continue to use.",3
is ok not what expected,3

Great product.,3
"This toothpaste gets your teeth clean. I find that other natural toothpastes don’t get your teeth as scrubbed clean like the usual Colgates, Crest, etc. toothpastes, however, this one did. The purple color was did not stain your teeth and it actually lathers up well and turns white. The taste wasn’t off-putting and wasn’t too mild nor too overwhelming. I don’t know if it whitened my teeth much, but one of my friends told me that for teeth whitening toothpastes to work you actually have to let them sit on your teeth for at least 15 minutes each time you brush. I am trying to implement that into my daily routine. For the price, and compared to other whitening toothpastes, I don’t think the price is worth it.",3
"So, I have been using this toothpaste for about 2 months now. Not really seeing any whitening effects, but otherwise really like it. Nice flavor, gentle on my gums, teeth feel clean. No bad morning breath. But this is dang expensive to not whiten my teeth. Likely won't reorder at this price",3
"It’s ok, it I like the pastier ones better. This is the equivalent of foamed hand soap as opposed to regular hand soap. Will look for a different one next time",3
"Used with both Crest and Colgate toothpastes. Instead of a screw-tight fit, the cap will begin to just spin. That said, if you tighten to just before it starts spinning, then it work fine. Just be aware that it's essentially still an open tube so toothpaste will dry a bit over time.",3
Doesn’t fit my grandsons toothpaste tube,3
"The formula definitely offers a very temporary Whiteness to teeth, but sadly does not last further than a few minutes.There is also no cleaning component within the foam.Although it does taste quite nice and gives an immediate whiteness, the product does not live up to the hype.",3
I didn’t notice a difference with my teeth. Not pleased.,3
"It’s not “unflavored,” it’s sweetened with sorbitol. My bad, should have read the ingredient list. Otherwise, I like it: a little foam, a good clean feel to my mouth.",3
"Usually love Colgate, but this toothpaste has a runny consistency and my daughter gets it all over the place. She loves the flavor, but I am not a fan.",3
Lovely taste.. Kids love it.. But oh my the price is ridiculous. Won't be buying this again.,3
Got this after watching videos and seeing reviews of how great it works. I have been using it for over a week now and see no difference in the whitening of my teeth. The paste also globs up on my teeth and doesn't distribute evenly. Don't trust purple tooth paste.,3
"This was too gritty, got stuck between my teeth and I needed to floss and rinse after brushing. The flavor was good and my teeth felt clean but i just can't get over how gritty it is.",3
"I barely got into toothpaste tablets and tried out NOBS really like it so I seen these at a better price, but very brittle and my mouth didn’t feel so clean after. I would use 3 tablets just to feel clean.",3
"The media could not be loaded. My ear canals must be very clean, because nothing came out while using this, except the irrigation water. I heated the water to 98° F. Never use cold or hot water to irrigate your ears. It should always be around body temperature. This product has 4 streams of water and different levels of pressure. The pressure was good, but no ear wax came out. I really wanted to like this, but after using it, my ears actually felt plugged. Two hours later and lots of q-tips trying to soak up the moisture, my ears still feel plugged. From now on, I will leave ear irrigation to the professionals.",3
works ok doesnt have as much pressure as i hoped however i do understand why too much and water would shoot out the my other ear,3
"I think I was expecting more because of the brand. It would be nice if the chambers marked which ways the batteries went in. The product doesn’t feel solid. Seems cheaply made and, it’s really loud. It would also be nice if there were a carry case or bag for the brush heads.",3
"I have mixed feelings about this ear wax camera. I thought maybe I would be able to see down my ear canal to the eardrum, but that is not possible because the canal curves. Also, the scraper sits in front of the camera and would need to be way down the canal before the camera could see. I don’t feel this is safe to put down the ear canal. The metal scrapers included with the kit are definitely not safe. Don’t put this stuff down your ear canal! Leave that to doctors.Now the mixed feeling part is because the camera is actually pretty cool. You can see things really close up. It functions like a low power microscope displaying on your phone. I ran it across my skin and could see every pore and every hair and every blemish in super close detail. Creepy looking honestly. I was able to see around the sides of my teeth close up. I could see the individual pixels on my TV screen. You get the idea. The app takes pictures and video too.",3
"This does work, but only for a few minutes before the water runs out. I will only get it out for small jobs. I personally really don't like having to stop and wait for the cool down and then the heat up to only get to work for a couple of minutes.That being said, I have never used a steamer before and I was able to quickly understand what to do to get this working. The instructions are pretty well written. Not perfectly clear, but good enough.The included measuring cup is very convenient as it is marked with the maximum amount of water you can put in.I tested mine on buildup in a shower. I tried it out on glass shower doors and on the bottom of the tub and on some grout. I did need to learn to go slower with it and let the steam do its job. I do think I will get better at it over time. If I can be patient enough to wait through the process.",3
"I bought this to help me clean my showers because of my hands. It is easy to use, but it does not clean the way I was hoping. The Speeds are ok, but the top speed you really have to hold on tight. Also I had to put a lot of pressure to scrub, still it did not clean the build up in my shower. I would like to have at least one cleaning head with harder bristles for the more harder cleaning. After I charged it the first time I've used it 3 times for about 15 mins. and it's still working so I guess the battery is pretty good. I think I'm going to keep it to wash my cars or some mild cleaning.",3
If I could have tested this product before buying I would not have purchased. It doesn’t do a great job and cleaning the base boards like advertised. It doesn’t bend at the bottom so it’s hard to maneuver to me. It also keeps coming detached from the bottom while using. Not my favorite! May return.,3
It is easy to apply with your hands but I prefer using a small plastic spoon. It dries well and it's easy to peel off leaving the skin firm. Its gentle on the skin and gets the dead skin off. The only bad thing is the freshly applied gel sting the eyes a little bit at first when it's less than 1 in from your eyes. After a sec it's OK. Would prob test another peel off mask before buying again.,3
"My skin feels nice enough after using this mask but there are two big cons that make me hesitant to reorder this.1. You need to use a fair bit to create a thick enough layer that doesn't break off into bits while removing it.2. It has a very strong, glue like smell. It's really overpowering and having to put so much on your face doesn't help.I'll keep using it but I'm not sure if the results I gain are significant enough to justify the cost and cons.",3
"I tried to make a picture of how it feels to look through these things. As a novelty, they work well, but for any serious reading, the tiny size of the viewing windows are a constant detriment. I would recommend you keep looking for a horizontal reading solution. The technology is not there yet. Larger prisms, a wider nose bridge, and more plastic material around the frame edges would improve these a lot.The prisms are quite small, measuring about 27mmx44mmx32mm; apparently, you're hard-pressed to find any silvered prisms larger than this, which is a real pity. With larger prisms and a larger viewing window, these could be great for reading books from a comfortable distance, and not with the text in line with ones nipples.This means that the actual portion of my field of view that the image takes up is not even 40%. This might be able to be improved, if the nose bridge were not so extremely narrow so that you cannot slide them all the way on your face. I do not have an exceptionally large nose, or maybe I do; I cannot put these on my face nearly far enough to close out all the exterior sights and shadows. I have worn large over-the-glasses shades before, and they shut out the light nicely around the edges of my vision. These are too small to do so. They are perched on my nose like Ben Franklin reading spectacles.There is ghosting on the viewing image, like when you put your face very near a mirror and can see a slight... ghostly image. This is probably unavoidable due to the nature of light refracting through a prism, but still detracts from the reading experience considerably when there is a superimposed mirror ghost image over the bottom half of the book. I have tried to show this in my mockup photo.There is an upside-down image above each eye, which is even more distracting than the superimposed ghost image. This does not seem to be avoidable either.They fit over my glasses nicely, which I didn't expect. That is nice, because in contrast to one reviewer's husband's experience, I CANNOT see in focus through these without my glasses.The sides of the prisms are shiny, and having three large vertical whitish bars is also rather distracting when reading. There might not be any way to make these less obtrusive, but a matte finish or different color or angle might improve this aspect.",3
"These are the best readers I've come across yet, being autofocus is the best! The only problem I have is the quality of the plastic in the frames because they don't last they crack and fall apart so the price reflects that by many it's still worth the money.",3
"What does auto focus means? Not what I was thinking, these are simple reading glasses.",3
Good for reading,3
The glasses are very heavy and not real comfortable but the idea of them is still good.,3
"It does work, but it does mess with youMakes you feel weirdLittle dizzyI just didn’t like how I felt after I used it for a little bit",3
"I was actually excited to try this item, simply for the novelty of such a product and also because, well, let’s face it… I’m lazy. I’ve only used these glasses once or twice while laying bed so I could watch TV while also reading during the commercials, and I don’t think I’ll be keeping them because they aren’t really good for long-term, practical use.As far as ‘periscope’ vision goes, the glasses didn’t seem to provide as steep of an angle as I was expecting, therefore I was a bit disappointed.It was certainly interesting to try, but it felt a bit awkward wearing them and it was disorienting/dizzying and almost nauseating for me to have them on for more than a few minutes at a time. The glasses don’t exactly provide the crispest vision since you’re viewing a reflection of an image, so naturally it’s a bit discombobulating.And of course anyone wearing these looks absolutely ridiculous – I felt like I looked like Mr. Krabs from SpongeBob 😂So in summary, this would make a great gag gift or stocking stuffer as long as you don’t take it too seriously or expect too much from it.",3
"- Light & works as intended.- Though the area the glass covers is small, so I’m able to see surrounding area, which is kinda annoying.",3
"I was hopeful that these would work well. I wanted to put them on a couple sunglasses that do no have a bifocal magnification. With all honesty - I was disappointed. I followed the directions as given - and I have a great pair of Ray Bans with flat lenses - they are just not 'sticking' like I had hoped. With a 2.50 magnification, they are also a little thicker than I had expected. They DO help with reading.Will they work in a pinch? Maybe......I'm a little nervous to wear them for fear the magnification lens will fall off. I purchased two sets - so I'll try them and see what happens. Not horribly confident, though.",3
"There are problems with multiple reflections, they're also too heavy to wear for long. A clever idea that's too hard to execute.",3
Worked great to blocking sunlight. Almost impossible to read through the dark magnifying portion of the lens.,3
I had planned on wearing these glasses only for looking at the GPS instruments in my airplaneThe glasses are as advertised but as I don't normally wear glasses I had to purchase a pair of glasses with no magnification to connect the flip glasses to. I find this uncomfortable to have to wear glasses all the time rather than only when needed.If possible I would like to order a pair of flip down glasses of the same 2.5 power that connect to the peak of a baseball style cap.Please let me know if you have a product like this in stock.ThanksRobert Moran,3
"They are OK (lenses are reasonable quality), but I managed to break the clasp on the first day. My fault, but ....",3
They were cheap but not very helpful,3
"I love this idea and use these glasses, but this is the 4th set I've owned because the batter flaps are flimsy and they break easily. These are pricy for that sort of failure, but there are incredibly useful, so I keep buying them despite their high failure rate. I gotta say, as soon as I find a more durable set of reading specs with lights I'll switch to those. These are cheaply made.",3
"Well first off I am NOT impressed by the packaging. Mine arrived wrapped in bubble wrap taped up so tightly that they had to be cut open. I was so worried I was going to cut the glasses and I came VERY close to getting the cord. Glasses are not as bright as I was hoping for/expected. Glasses are not as crisp as expected.However, they do work well for the price. I highly recommend upgrading packaging. I would give you an extra star if ANY of the above were better. But it would be too much effort to return them at this point. <shrug>",3
Nice glasses but too expensive,3
"I suppose you get what you pay for. I can use them as an extra pair but I would never order them again. I thought they were an ""oversized"" style.... they were listed as an oversized. But they're not. I like the color but that's about it.",3
These readers are light and comfortable but not meant for people who are rough on glasses. I love they are frameless but not sturdy enough for me,3
Bend easily,3
I like the sunglasses one the most because when looking at my phone in the sun I could actually see it.,3
I've been wearing progressive lenses for 30+ years. These are not progressives and I was unable to adjust.,3
"These progressive lenses really work well, but after 4 months 2 pairs (of the 3 in the order) have already broken. I've just received the second order and we'll see how long they last.",3
"I was so excited when I saw these. I spend my day swapping between .75, 1.0, (computer screens) 1.25 and 1.50 (on the work floor, First Aid applications). I also use a 2.50 for tiny work but I don't wear them regularly. I'm an EH&S manager so I'm always changing safety glasses depending on the situation with which I have to contend and most of my glasses are ANZI diopters. I thought these might be perfect for office work.These are so close but the focal length is strange. I ordered the 1.5's thinking the 1.5 would be on the bottom and digress as your eyes moved up the lens. The top part of the glasses is about a .5. I'm not sure what the middle is but I suspect it's supposed to be somewhere between a .75 to and 1. I find myself nodding up-and-down and moving back-and-forth trying to find the prefect spot for what I am doing. Even still, I can't seem to get a clear picture and the computer font can look doubled.I'm typing on my PC now (obviously) and I've just reverted back to my trusty, basic 1.0's, positioned close to the end of my nose and do the over-the-top-of-the-fame-peek when someone comes to the door.",3
"I thought they might be ""do-all"" driving glasses (distance, GPS, distance, GPS) but the grading is pretty steep so you only can use a fraction of the overall aperture for any particular thing.Oh, well. It was an idea.",3
This isn’t their fault but I was hoping to switch the prism to look up and they're firmly attached.,3
"These glasses work awesome and I wish I could have kept them. Unfortunately I have a small face and a small nose and they just kept sliding off, especially as they are on the heavy side. They did fit my step dad so they would work for some people.",3
"Not as I expected, I ordered this after reading the reviews, awful for reading.",3
Because I have cataract surgery I have new lenses in my eyes when I looked through the upper part of the glass it’s blurry I presume it’s because my lenses work better than the lenses in the glasses,3
"Basically, they took sunglasses and pasted on a little corner of bifocal. Talk about disappointing don’t waste your money.",3
Very cute but very cheap plastic.,3
This item is inferior to two SAV Sportex readers I have previously acquired. It is much less substantial with the thickest part of the frame half the size of my previous Sportex glasses. It doesn’t fit comfortably. Always feels like it is ready to fall off. Previous glasses were so comfortable it was possible to forget you were wearing them. I can’t recommend the current version of this product. Fortunately I still have one of the good Sportex glasses.,3
I've bought these before from my pharmacy and was very happy with them . These though are very flimsy in the ear area.. they cheapened them ...,3
"Not sure if its just my small head...but these are sturdy yes, which makes them hard. not flimsy glasses. They are snug on the nose and behind the ears...well more so ontop of the ears where they lay tends to be uncomfortable after a while. same with the nose piece. Other than that these are great for when you're laying down and want to read and not strain your neck",3
They a really cute bifocals but the do not darken in the sun.,3
"My first pair lasted a year when it unexpectedly broke, I had really liked them, so I bought a 2nd pair to replace it. THAT pair lasted only 5 months, when the frame broke in EXACTLY the same spot. But then the company sent we a replacement for free, so we'll see how this pair lasts.",3
"Lightweight and comfortable, but break easily. That said, its almost impossible to scratch them. I've bought multiple pairs because I keep breaking them, but I still go back to them because of its other good qualities.",3
"It seems like a better solution, right? You don't have to have a pointy 60-lb metal object hanging out your window. Easy to roll around etc.But it's not a better solution.1. In order to blow hot air out the window, the air has to come from somewhere. It's called negative pressure. This AC sucks air in from other rooms, from around your door frames etc. Warm air. So while it's cooling your room, it's also sucking warm air in from the rest of your house.2. The condenser condenses water. Unless you locate it near a drain, a unit like this has nowhere to send the water--so it just puts it back into the air. So you get a very MOIST environment. Like water is condensing on the unit and making little puddles.3. The compressor is noisy--and now it's inside your room rather than hanging out the window.4. It takes up valuable floor space.I suppose this unit is fine for what it is. But a good window unit will beat it 10 days out of 10.",3
"This works well as a fan, but is actually quite loud even on the lowest setting.The cool setting uses the water in the basin, which is terribly difficult to fill, since no funnel is offered and the fill spot is way at the bottom, inside a panel, which is also a bit tough to remove. Try that with a gallon jug.It got so thick in the air, with moisture, but didn't especially cool the place off. The only saving grace was the direct fan. Honestly.",3
"At this price point it’s not worth it. I mean, the fan is not bad, the water makes the air coming out cooler, but it won’t cool down the room and lower the temperature. It even says on the box that it won’t make your room cooler. It’s just a strong winded, loud (!) fan that is nice as long as you’re right in front of it. On hot days when we put it in our bedroom and close the door it’s like walking into a humid hot pool house a couple hours later. Oh! And it makes screeching sounds when it reaches lower water levels so you don’t get the stated hours of use out of it. Buy a cheaper fan, this ain’t worth it.",3
"THE GOOD: The front grid is more solid than the previous model. If you fill it with Ice and Water, it does help to cool....but only if you add ice. If you just fill with water it is no better than a fan. It is a nice looking unit. THE BAD: The power cord is much shorter than the previous model, which is a problem. The remote is flimsy, cheap, doesn't work that well and is really difficult to open. Once you do open it, you will find it needs one of those round, Quarter size batteries (which, of course, is not included). This model doesn't beep when the water level is getting low. There is no warning system. You have to unscrew the back of the unit in order to clean the filter. With the previous model you could just slide the filter out to clean it.",3
"It cools, but noisy when compressor running, no noise insulation at all, vibration cause plastic housing more noise. window seal kit has uneven height, need extra thick rubber tapes to help sealing air gaps.",3
"large, loud, more like a big expensive fan, only cools if standing in front of it, my apartment is 700 sq feet and it does not cool to the level I would hope for, also it increases humidity which leads to mugginess and further sweating in heat, returning",3
Be aware this unit ships only with a US plug and you will require a converter if you want to use it in the UK. This information is not supplied by the seller.,3
Not sure why the funnel keeps disconnecting from the unit. Highly annoying. It's loud but cools the area well.,3
"First allow me to say what the headline clearly states: This is not an air conditioner in any way, shape, or form. If you are seeking something that is going to cool a room down, this is not the product that is going to miraculously do that for you. In fact, I have searched high and low for a product that was like that only to realize that such things don't exist unless you have a window unit or a the very least a window for ventilation tubing that connects to a true portable AC unit.However, as a simple little desktop fan, it's not bad. I don't think it is worth the cost, nor do I believe in all the hype this product received when it became available. But it isn't terrible. I could have bought something far cheaper and probably received a product that did the same thing. I would also like to note, that when I first received the item, it was defective, and I had to return it for a replacement. Still, I do think it is decent for what it is. And when compared to a regular fan of the same size, the water and filter aspect of this will give you a cooler breeze, just not a life changing one.",3
"Small but kind of powerful. This fan indoors gets really cool and does a good job cooling off. However we took this outdoors to my son's soccer game and it didn't live up to the hype as much. It did provide airflow as if it was slightly windy, however it wasn't able to get cool. Please note I have not tried with ice or water yet. For that reason I'm giving it 3 stars. But as for being able to take it remotely anywhere you think you may be hot, this is great to move wherever. Charging does take 6 hours, best to do overnight.",3
"Given time, this unit will definitely cool down a room, the difference between the temperature is noticeable, and if you let it run for multiple hours without stopping, it will get noticeably chilly even. It does work, but that being said, the unit is INCREDIBLY loud. I have to turn my phone volume to near maximum in order to hear anything. The loudness is in fact so bothering that It becomes complicated to watch tv without worrying that the volume of the tv will bother the downstairs neighbors. This can be remedied by investing in noise cancelling headphones, but I wish it could be quieter, sleep mode does not make a difference in sound level. Installation was complicated, I had to modify the panel by cutting part of it off in order for it to fit my window, after which it left a jagged looking edge on the panel. The hose was easy to put on and install. The remote control feels relatively cheap, but it does indeed perform its intended function. The unit is fairly compact all things considered. The fan speed is okay, but nothing incredibly impressive. I will note that the fan sometimes sounds like it’s scraping. Overall the unit will cool your room to a comfortable level, but you should expect this unit to have noticeable problems. (Auto evaporation function works, review based on mid 80s to low 90s weather) I will say that I expected more from this, it exudes a very cheap vibe. This is a very good example of “you get what you pay for” I would urge anyone looking at this to explore better options before you find yourself wanting something better.",3
"Not exactly what was to be expected for the money it costs, definitely removes humidity but not so much an air cooler",3
High powered fan at best definitely not going to cool off a room...cools off the direct few feet in front of where it's blowing... a little louder than expected but not unbearable.Update: This also leaks a massive amount of water. If leaving on over night it will fill at minimum a 3 gal. Bucket with water,3
"It works great! However, it is IMPERATIVE to note the very high noise it makes. If you sleep in a small room and use this, you won't be able to use it at night because of how loud it is. Otherwise, nothing bad to say about it, great for the pric",3
"Love, my DREO oil filled radiator heater. Swamp cooler works well. However, it has a small water capacity. You need to refill water and change ice two or three times a day depending on the temperature & your settings. Water tank is difficult to disconnect & reconnect. So I bring water to the cooler in bottles. Somewhat high maintenance. Cools one small room 5 to 10° depending. Probably best to supplement a window or central AC. Handsome and slim design with a small footprint. Multiple settings.",3
"It's ok. it doesn't cool off the room as it says it does and I have a pretty small room. I have to add ice to the bucket to even feel cool air and I have to place it very close to my bed so I can feel the cool air. When the ice melts and water is no longer cold; it's not as cool. At the end of the day it does work, but with a few adjustments.",3
Couldn't cool down a small tent,3
"This portable evap cooler did little to help during this 110-degree summer, the continuous fill option might be the better way to make use of it. The wheels at the base make it extremely easy to move into the room where it is needed and it is extremely easy to use with only the water reservoir and the fan level you want to place it on. However, the cooling power itself leaves something to be desired.",3
"Unless you can put it in front of a window or a source of dry air and have a door open on the other side of the room, it is just a big humidifier.It needs to work like a dairy barn. Fan pulls Outside air in though the pad and into the room.Only difference is the fan is on the other end of the dairy barn exhausting and pulling outside air through through the pad.not blowing into the barn.If it just circulated inside air though the pad it wouldn’t cool and if there was no exhaust it would be a soupy mess lol. If the air going thru the pad is not dry and it’s humid then there will be little to no evaporation occurring on the pad and thus no evaporative cooling effectIf you’re in a dry place this will come in handy don’t need anything there just turn it on.",3
The media could not be loaded. This is a good fan to sit on your desk. Even with ice in the reservoir it doesn't get really cold. It's not meant to cool an entire room. But it's good as a personal fan.,3
Have to have it plugged up to use and would not work with another cord I had it only worked with the original cord,3
"While this is a less expensive option, it emits a great deal of noise especially in a small room. If it weren't such a hassle and drain on the planet, we would return. It cools our room fine (300 square feet) and was easy to assemble. But it is in my office and I must turn off to answer the phone. It is a background hum, but loud. So much for, you get what you pay for. Otherwise fine.",3
The product worked really well but I only had this air cooler for two weeks and the filter smelled a little fishy and I cleaned it but it still smell a bit,3
Bottom vents are not open and only for show. Hard to remove bottom water tray to clean. Seems to get slimy even when using distilled water. Cools somewhat but not great. Fan is quite noisy.,3
"Had the product for over 1 yr and ready to throw it out. It worked great at first, though some times it felt like the compressor was going out. Now it cannot even cool the one room its supposed to. It is set to 70, and the room is still near 80.",3
It doesn't blow alot of air,3
The media could not be loaded. You have to keep water in the tank for any cool air to blow out then when it runs out it will make a loud noise so you know it’s out of water and it’s just a regular fan. Not worth the money if you ask me. But I guess it works some what.,3
"I got this at a really good price to keep my room cool in the summer. So far, it's working alright - However the ""evaporative cooling"" does not keep up at all. I've had to use the included drain to drain it out the window - and let me tell you, that plug is situated an inch off the ground. Makes it really hard to empty it, it should be situated higher!Standard issues with the single hose setup - it creates negative air pressure in the room which draws in hot air, and the cold air from the bedroom the machine uses is quite counterintuitive.However, the power usage seems to be optimal, and for that I'll give it a solid 3 stars.",3
"Had hoped this would actually cool the air, but in Chicago on a normal summer day, the humidity is too high for it to work. Might work in low humidity environments. I don't know. Otherwise, quiet enough for white noise to sleep with, although noisier than a $20 table fan if you want to watch TV. Wouldn't have bought it if I'd read or thought about the description more carefully. Description as an air conditioner is somewhat misleading, as even with the ice packs, it had no effect on a small room.",3
During the day when it's really hot it doesn't cool to much but at night it does work really good.,3
"Great for spot cooling, i wish i had known that the watertank is not removable.its almost impossible to clean the tank except for rinsing it and letting it drain via the drainplug.Also,no mentioning in the instructions if the watercurtain can be replaced.If you have hard water definitely add a water treatment.Its a nuce unit otherwise.",3
It works more like a fan than air conditioner. When you put the ice in it is cold for a half hour than works more like a fan. Should have spent more money and got a window air unit.,3
"Ordered 8/11/2024, this product was good and served the purpose, however,it ran fine until yesterday and no mist/fan shut off now. I would expect the quality shall be at least last passing 1+ year or last even longer like some other brands I used. 3 star as neutral.",3
"**UPDATE** It stopped working after a year. It was used daily, but only for maybe fifteen minutes a day. it worked great, but it didn't last long at all.This has been absolutely wonderful since day one. The unit is quiet, much quieter than the standard window air conditioner, and is super easy to move from room to room. The outflow of air is just right and is enhanced by the oscillating feature. It's not an eyesore or difficult to operate. It has a convenient feature in which it beeps to let you know that the water level is too low to use with the cool feature.",3
"Item is okay, but little heavy and little big for us. Sounds okay for low volume, little noise for high volume, new start to use has some plastic smell because it made by heavy duty plastic, but after blow out for a while before use, smell is away. Worked as a cooler and big fan, so far I grade it 3 to 4 star max.",3
"It took a long time for this to ship, the box was beat up when it arrived but the contents seemed ok. While waiting for it to ship I purchased and used the 10,000 BTU version of this air conditioner from another store (it’s ultimate destination to a bedroom). The 10,000 version was easy to put together (once I figured out the top of the box lifts off the packaging after you cut the straps) and worked well cooling the area. The 14,000 version is a bit bigger, was difficult to wrangle the hose (kept unlocking and detaching one side or another and popping out of the brackets all together). And really was disappointing as it works nowhere near as well as the 10,000 did in the same area. I had high hopes, more power would equate to better cooling. I’ll keep using it to see if it gets any better and update if it does (especially since it would be hard to wrangle, repackage and return). This was definitely a case of more power being no better. Also I do agree the dry mode tends to feel cooler than the actual AC mode and is better at cooling a larger area.",3
The fan gives pretty good air flow but the cooling part doesnt really do much! Not that much of a difference with or without ice! Good fan not a good air conditioner.,3
"It a fan.. nothing special.. blows air. The ice packs are pretty pointless. But it keeps you cool, I guess..",3
I have only used it a very short time and will try it again before I say if it can keep up with the heat and humidity.,3
"I have only had this a could of days and haven't decided if I will try to return this or not. It does a decent job of pushing out cool air if the ice packs are loaded. It is also compact and light weight and was easy to install. I use a humidifier at night, so this was a good way for me to get extra humidity in the house at the same time I'm cooling.The instructions are useless in telling you how to read the water level or how to remove the water tank to empty or clean it. Other reviews made me realize reading the water level is nearly impossible - so you just guess when you're filling it that you haven't overfilled. I still haven't figured out how to empty and/or clean the water tank. Also, several other reviews say it leaks and I just installed new wood flooring, so I'll have to buy a tray to put it on if I keep it. Hmmm...",3
"I bought this for my bedroom/office. Room is 11 x 11 and houses 2 computers and 4 monitors so it does run warmer than it should. This lil guy was so great out the gate back in the spring when I got it. Unfortunately it is now struggling mightily. Set at 22---celsius I think, which is 72 according to google. I'm sitting right in front of it sweating. No way is my room 72. 82 degrees MAYBE. Which is better than the current 99 outside in TX. Every half hour or so it has a mini heart attack and shudders hard enough to rattle my window/floor. It's not so bad when it doesn't wake me up at night. I really wanted this to be better. But I may be asking too much.",3
Loading from the top takes a long time to fill. The ice packs do little to chill the water as it passes over them so quickly Not to bad otherwise. Decent fan speeds and semi compact size,3
"The Dial 3-Speed Portable Evaporative Cooler is decent for cooling smaller spaces up to 500 sqft. The 1300 CFM airflow is adequate, and the three-speed settings offer some flexibility. However, I found it to be a bit noisy at higher speeds, which can be distracting. Additionally, the cooling performance is just average, especially on really hot days. It's a good option if you need a portable cooler, but don't expect it to replace an air conditioner.",3
"The size is great, but it doesn't blow enough cold air to keep a small room cool. I bought this a/c for my garage but is not what I expected.",3
"I bought these so that I would not have headphone hair whenever I play video games and plan on going out later. They work great and have good sound quality when they are snug in your ear. However, these tend to come loose from your ear with any minor movement that you make and after about 20 minutes of use, the band that goes over your ear starts to dig in and hurt. Overall, I would not really recommend these. I would rather spend a bit more to get something a bit more comfortable and better sounding such as the Razer Hammerhead Duo.",3
"Headset was renewed so about 60% price of new. Headset was kinda gross like it was just exposed in a warehouse, really would have taken little effort to wipe it with a cloth to make it presentable. Was dirty in the way a neglected tshirt in a warehouse might get (the fuzzy bits on the headband). Upon setting the device up the sound quality leaves a bit to be desired; directly comparing it to the same device utilized with the same hardware setup previously. I bought this because I lost the wireless dongle (found outjust 5 minutes ago logitech sells this replacement piece for $15 - so I sort of paid 3x as much given I didn't need the headset or charging cable which is my mistake -. Some of the sound is bad when the headset is trying to recreate a specific audio range, there is no interference or anything conflicting. Sound in general is worse than the sound from my monitor. 3/5, should be a 4/5 product had it before better sound",3
So the stand is cool. Serves its purpose. But the pole just sits on top of a post in the base. The pole is too wide so it leans. The top plate also is flimsy and sits crooked and spins when you barely touch it.The lights are neat and that it has 2 USB ports but I wouldn't get it again.,3
"These sound absolutely amazing, they are also loud yet crystal clear I love the sound! Now there is two core things to headphones for me, sound and comfortability. Sound is amazing but comfort it lacks heavily for me. I may have bigger ears or something but no matter what adjustments I make, they always feel uncomfortable to my ears, the originals never did that to my ears before so I don't know what's up. They just aren't very comfortable but everyone's head/ears are different so it may not work for me but great for you!",3
"The headset sounds good and all but in order to get the best out of it you have to use razer's software... which crashes all the time, is often slow to respond, and all around just a nightmare to deal with on the side.If you're ok with some of your features being locked behind a barely useable piece of software then it's a good headset. If you want your full moneys worth, you'll want to look else where.",3
Not enough description and close up to see if it would fit,3
"I have owned 2 of these and 1 was lost neither has had functionality issuesPROS1.The functionality is more than sufficient and may be better than OEM. It still works well when out of comfortable position.2. The price point is OK, I really feel it shouldn't be over $10 maybe $93. Durability is Solid!CONS1. The over-long boom (neck that mic sits on)2. The fit SUCKS!!!!! It needs frequent (near constant if you can't get the sweet-spot) repositioning for stability. It caneasily fall out of the headset when placed down flat or not on your head walking around.I would rate 4*If they dropped the price for the performance5* (at current price point $12)If they fixed the fit/stability issues (reduced boom length1.5-2""/reduced weight is likely all that's needed)",3
These are the most comfortable headphones I've ever used. They have great sound and they are comfortable for many hours at a time. The microphone works great. BUT. The pads fall apart after just a few months. They also come off the headphones entirely.,3
"I like Rig headsets, their durable and comfortable. They also give great sound quality. My old one recently got the charger stuck in it causing me to buy a new one. This would looked great and was cheaper than the one I recently had. I ordered it and when I received it I started to set it up. However, this type of headset does not connect to consoles. In the video they show it does but they use a different usb drive. The one they send you does not come with a option to switch it to gaming. Headset still works perfectly but for pc, not my xbox. Gonna have to send it back and get a new one. Please double check that it is compatible with console before buying, big mistake I made",3
"Product was good but after a week it started disconnecting randomly. Assistance was good but for returns,it costs me 45$ to send it back for refund or replacement so I guess I’ll just try to repair it myself instead of throwing my money out the window",3
If you have a Dual Sense Edge this stand will NOT work for charging your controller. Just an FYI. Other than that it’s solid.,3
"Ok headphone stand for the price, however It had a strong plastic like scent. Overall does its job.",3
"I put a picture cause idk what this part is called, but it just shocked me when I went to move the cord and touched one of the screws. The audio and mic quality are better than expected, it kind of hurts my ears after 30 mins of wearing them. Overall not bad for the money, I've had these for about a year now.Honestly if I could go back I would get a different product. Anyways.. if anyone wants a HEAVILY discounted pink pair of these let me know! I don't want these suckers anymore, wireless ftw",3
"I bought this back in the end of February, opened it and used it a few times. Only for listening though. To which this headset has very good sound and clarity. Its also very comfortable for being on the bottom tier of gaming headsets.Unfortunately I never ended up using the microphone which is a plug in until about a month later. Come to find out it was dead or the connection to the 3.5mm jack is bad. Have not been able to determine which it is. Sadly its now just a nice headset for listening to music. My Rub here was that I tried to ask for a replacement, not a refund and I'm 3 days past the return date. While that is mostly on me for not checking this sooner, something like this that was purchased relatively recently should have still been able to be replaced since a major component was defective.",3
"The Xbox turns on and seems to work fine, but the controller doesn't turn on at all.",3
It works plays the games but it does like to turn on its own when not it use. Has turned off on its own while using it but not when playing a game.other than that works great,3
The regular power cord did not work thankfully I had another one from my previous Xbox 360. So no return was needed. It did not come with a cord charger for the remote but I still made it work.,3
Really cute. I had to pry the beak open a little so it would work with normal toothpicks. A cute gimmick.,3
Not as fluffy as pictured. A little disappointed but think it will still work for what was needed.,3
"The placemats are super thin which is why I only gave them 3 stars. They look nice and price is good, but they tear easily.",3
Very light can get blown away quickly. I thought it was hard paper but it's very cheap paper. Size was okay. It seems like they just printed with color ink on it.,3
Get alot of placemats for the money.,3
Too many colors. Blue should be water only. Is Switzerland in Italy and Austria? Is Russia in Europe and Asia. What devides Russia and Asia.I like the pads. They don’t fold or tear. Easy to read.,3
"These are cute, but they are too small. You’ll see in the pictures of dinner plate covers most of it, a dessert plate leaves some exposed and it’s cute. There made of good enough material, easy to wash strong enough that they won’t bend and fold if you’re careful with them. If I had bought them at Walmart. I would probably return them. But I don’t believe it to be the Sellers problem. I’m sure that they provided measurements and I just didn’t pay attention because I thought they were so cute.",3
They are bright but I used one outside as a decorative center piece on the glass table on my deck and in a week it faded. Very disappointed.,3
great quality but ours came with a little warp in the middle of them all,3
"Well, I ordered 4 packs of these placemats. Not what I expected. I was hoping they were a thicker, padded mat but they were just flat vinyl. I feel they were pretty expensive for what you get...",3
I didn't realize these placemats are not what I expected. I thought they're harder but they're just too bendable or foldable.,3
"Nice pattern but very thin,",3
"These placemats have a lovely print but they are very thin, similar to table napkins.",3
The feel cheap and flimsy but get the job done.,3
Great when it worked but broke after about 100 toothpicks,3
"First the good: I received my Chromebook in excellent condition! Considering its age, it looked like new and has great performance. Not one scratch or blemish on it. 2 in 1 touch screen works perfectly. No issues with hinges when placing it in tablet mode. All keys worked. Not mentioned on product page is that it had 4 ports (2 USB C style and 2 older style) and a micro SD slot. All of which work fine. Now the bad and my only complaint: The product page list this Chromebook as being released on 6/16/2022. I purchased this Chromebook based on this information. When I first turned it on, I checked through OS settings and saw that the Auto Update Expiration date is 6/2027. Only 3 years from now. Upon further investigation, I found out that this device was released in 6/2018. IMO, This is very DECEPTIVE!! I purchased this item based on the listed release date on the product page. If I had known it was 2018, I would have purchased a newer, i.e., 2020, renewed Chromebook I saw out there. Lesson learned for me. I would have given this product 5 stars, it really is in excellent condition, but due to the deception, I am knocking it down to 3, and debating whether to keep it or return it. I also wasn’t pleased that a few hours after ordering the Chromebook, all of a sudden it was around $10 cheaper than what I paid for it. Then the next day it was back to around what I paid for it.If you are OK with a Chromebook that will receive OS updates for only 3 more years, then by all means purchase this one. New Chromebooks with 2 in 1 screens are not cheap. The one I received really is in great condition. Maybe I’ll just buy a used one every 3 years.",3
"The thing runs good enough for my school work. It came in pretty poor condition and had a stupid sticker covering the scratches. The stylus was not included and the charger for it was ripped out of the machine. It was legit glued together 🤦. I cant complain though, it was $100 and can browse the web.",3
"The computer seems fine, but the product description says this is a touchscreen and it's not",3
"The product is an attractive, utile piece of hardware, albeit one that is at times distractingly low-fidelity. It is sensibly priced for its modest specifications, however, and makes for a perfectly reasonable piece of equipment in the hands of someone who wants only for functional, uncomplicated tools. For such people, I am sure you will not be dissatisfied, but it is possible you will find better bargains for technology of this caliber elsewhere.",3
"11.024...I am an email, platform / charting user. big improvment from my 5 yr old HPlike: quick start up (dump edge and bing and it will be better)...key spacing good for my stumpy fingers...touch screen good... overall performance works for medislike: POOR BATTERY LIFE -4+ hrs continuous use, set to optimize performance...needs a newer mag-set power plug (the 3.5mm's stick out and are a hazard).. 256 memory is minimal (I knew this going in) and I find the SD slot card protrudes to far out.recommend you look for a similar deal but with a better battery, more memory or a better slot.",3
"I purchased this HP Chromebook 14"" G5 hoping for a simple and lightweight laptop to handle basic tasks like browsing the web, checking emails, and streaming videos. While it performs well for those tasks, I was disappointed with its speed. The Intel Celeron N3350 processor is simply not powerful enough for multitasking or more demanding applications. Unfortunately, this limitation wasn’t clearly stated in the product description, which could mislead potential buyers looking for a faster device.That being said, there are some positives worth mentioning. The Chromebook’s design is sleek and lightweight, making it easy to carry around. The 14-inch screen is bright and offers good resolution for watching videos, and the keyboard is comfortable for typing. Additionally, the device arrived in excellent condition, and for a renewed product, it looks brand new.If you’re looking for a budget-friendly laptop for very basic use, this could work for you. However, if speed and performance are important, I’d recommend exploring other options.",3
Very misleading! I needed a laptop for school and to be touchscreen. This one was on the Black Friday sale and it clearly states touchscreen. It is NOT touchscreen.,3
I don’t like how fast the battery life goes down. For example I charged it all while I was at church and i got on it to send a email and it said it was on 16 percent.,3
"If you're gonnaa use this laptop for anything other than doing homework, you're all set but if you stream, multitask, make music, play game; the lag is, not even exaggerating, unbearable.",3
"Was for my 11 year old and his school work, does what it's supposed to but the screen is sub par",3
Do not use Combination Studios as seller for this laptop. They shipped a defective product which appears to have been a retuned item. Lenovo claimed my recent purchase was for an item sold months earlier and it was out of warranty.,3
I ordered this pc and I got it early. It works but it won't hold a charge. I'm going to send it back and get a new one. It takes a while to set up so that sucks i have to do that again. but i need it to charge. i dont want to be stuck with the cord all the time. sometimes i gotta move with the pc.,3
"This is a good little computer and it's an annoying little computer. It is good that it is light weight and easily slips into a knapsack with no noticeable weight increase. Watch the battery life, it drains rather quickly and is slow to charge. The unit also cannot be used at night, unless, and this is a big unless, you are a master of the keyboard. The reason I say this is because the keys do not light up. That is a big deal to me, because my last little laptop key's lit up and I could continue to work into the night.Perhaps this is a new feature, or I haven't figured out how to fix it, but the icons line up on the left side of the screen and do not save. Meaning, every time I want to go to Google, I have to manually type it in. I set Google as my default search screen and it always defaults to Bing, another thing I do not like.So, in the end, I believe this was a get what I pay for system. It's good in that it's light weight, the processing speed is awesome, but that could be my internet provider. I do not like how the websites that I go to on a daily basis do not save on a top rack that I can just click on. The keys do not light up and that is a big downer for me.2.5 stars for this unit, but I gave it three, because it really is a solid little computer, the set up is just not to my personal liking.",3
"This Chromebook unit was refurbished. Paid $99. There is a vinyl sheet glued to the top so I suspect the top was scratched or badly worn. The edge of the sheet is peeling.The unit did not come with a charging cord so I called Amazon and they shipped a power cord a few days later. This unit has two USB ports and one HDMI port. Also has a port for a micro disc. The key pad has a mouse touch pad but I use one USB port for a wireless mouse, The unit is working properly.Chromebooks offer a good option for school work and new users to computers. The 11.5 screen is adequate and the operating system if fine for web browsing . There are several system applications and more can be downloaded from Google Play, much like an Android phone.The Docs app can be used to write letters, The Sheets app is for spreadsheets. Also has a camera for virtual meetings.Not a good unit for gamers. Similar to using your smartphone. Connect to internet using Bluetooth or tether to your phone.",3
"The pictures for this chromebook show it, a nexstand, a mouse, and a bag. The only items in the box were the chromebook and charger. This is false advertising. Other than that the chromebook arrived in perfect condition and is super fast. It was also advertised as touch screen and it most definitely is not.",3
"Cute and does what I need it to do. Its a bit slow, but I wasnt looking for speed...I wanted something that did the basics and had memory all for a bargain. My 1 complaint is the battery. Im used to my battery holding a full charge if the laptop sits unused a couple days. This one doesnt hold its charge very well. Dont get me wrong, it has a standard battery life when im using it.",3
"Functions as I need it EXCEPT battery only lasts about an hour. If it is plugged in, no issues. Not sure if is the model or just a crappy battery included with Amazon's refurbishment.",3
"Pretty fast laptop in great condition, only issue is it has an American keyboard. As and when I need to type a £ sign I may struggle. Why sell a laptop with an American keyboard in England? Baffling.",3
"I like this computer overall MINUS the camera glitch. I purchased this elitebook because I was looking for a budget friendly personal laptop. I have used a similar elitebook at my job, and it performed just fine. So, I figured why not. One con is that it is a bit heavy compared to the other elitebook I am accustomed to (don’t remember which specific one, sorry). This is minor.HOWEVER… I do a lot of work from my computer, including work that requires my presence on zoom and other video call softwares. Therefore I MUST have a laptop with a properly functioning camera. I contacted Amazon support and their troubleshooting method did not work. I contacted HP, downloaded several updates both on the computer system itself as well as the updates offered through the HP Assistant. Restarted several times. Camera still does not work.I am SO DISAPPOINTED ☹️.",3
the laptop arrived wtih part of the chassis broken off.,3
"I’ve had this computer for about 3 weeks now and the exterior and condition of the laptop is great but I’ve noticed it does not keep a charge for more than 3hrs. I will have it at a full 100% and quickly starts to die if I don’t have it plugged in constantly. A few of the keys are worn out so you have to push them with more force than others. May seem like a minor issue but leads to a lot of autocorrection needed which is not ideal for those who write lengthy assignments. The sound quality also is diminished once it’s turned up over 70%, it starts to sound as if part of the speaker is blown. The last issue is the speed of the computer is not nearly as fast as my previous Mac which is actually older than this model. I definitely want to return this product but can’t afford to wait over a week for a replacement.",3
The media could not be loaded. Hello laptop battery Life not good only 3.5 approx. Window 11 pro not licensed product. I want product key for windows 11 pro. Pls let me know,3
"The product has discoloration and external scratches. Also, some keys on the keyboard do not work properly.",3
"The computer is very very nice, It had everything but the fingerprint reader which is mainly why I ordered it. It was suppose to be a special feature that was in the description on the item. Amazon has contacted the seller just waiting for a response to get it straightened out.",3
"Unfortunately, this was one of those purchases where the negatives out weighed the positives. The positives are that it's a working lap top for 80 bucks and it's a Chromebook, so it will probably keep working. The negatives were: (a) the enclosed power cord was so wrong for the computer that it wouldn't even plug and I had to order a new one; (b) it was advertised as a 2020 model and the sticker on the back plainly says 2019. This matters with a Chromebook because they have updates for a limited number of years and once the updates are over, so is the computer. So, this effectively knocked a year of usage off the laptop. Finally, the screen of the computer very definitely does NOT fold over as shown in the pictures - it's a standard 45 degree hinge. I've been very pleased with refurbished electronics on Amazon in the past and consider them a wonderful deal. The quality control from this company, however, is either incredibly poor or just plain fraudulent. Not worth the hassle of returning, but very definitely not satisfactory.",3
"I bought this renewed Dell Latitude on July 20th, 2024. At first, I noticed that some of the keys need to be pressed harder than others, but everything else seemed to be working fine. So, I adjusted my typing to be more firm. Now, I'm having issues with the monitor flickering occasionally, sometimes for 5-10 seconds at a time, and I can't read what's on the screen. I've made sure to update all of the software and drivers, but it still has issues.",3
"We used this device for YouTube, google docs, kids’ school and email. It did what we needed it to for a great price. It came with a junky charging cord that needed to be replaced right away, but that was still under warranty. I purchased it in July ‘22 and now March ‘24 it died. It was inconvenient to wait for a new charging cord and 2 different batteries as I tried to trouble shoot it. Nothing has worked to power it on, and I am not paying asus to fix it as their warranty was less than a year.",3
I returned it! It was too far behind in the past.,3
Mine snapped not even a month into owning it.,3
"We bought this Chromebook, just to run an app for a Smartboard for my wife's classroom.The unit was nice and clean, ran the Smartboard fine, and we were happy with the price. After about 2 weeks, one of the shift keys stopped working. We asked for an exchange, and got a 2nd unit. This one had issues right out of the box. The scroll pad, just does not respond correctly. Also, the Smartboard won't fully function with this unit.We were going to get a 3rd unit, but you can't, until the others are returned. But my wife is at least getting by with the original, until we get a fully working replacement. We decided to try a refurbished HP Chromebook, and are going to return the two Dells for a refund.",3
I ordered 4 of these. They shipped quickly and chromebooks work well. My kids are homeschooled and they needed them for their schoolwork. One of the chargers came with frayed wires and won't charge. I contacted seller about getting it replaced and never heard back. Kids are sharing which is annoying.,3
"don't get me wrong the computer is in great condition. its fast and does everything i need it to do..but when setting it up everything was in chinese..EVERYTHING and it took 2 hours for me to get back to normal and then i realized i received a MacBook with some chinese keys on it. the caps lock button is in chinese and the ""enter"" button doesnt even have words on it so that was very inconvenient makes me feel like i have a fake. and I'm scared to get a replacement cause i don't wanna get one with the correct keys but a worse computer compared to this one",3
"Normally I'm pretty satisfied with my OtterBox purchases, but this one was a bit disappointing. Because the glitter case is clear, it's not made of a hard plastic like the others. For some reason I thought it would be a little harder but it's a flexible plastic. Also, as a side note, don't be dumb like me and use acetone or nail polish remover around this. I melted the side of it within the first couple of days of having it.",4
Love this kit as it is cheap but feels solid. It is easy to use and is nice and sharp out the box.,4
"So far so good. Very easy to install, easy cleaning, super smooth operation and great water flow.",4
"This is a pretty sturdy, safe alternative to the traditional mandolin (though still use caution). Has several functions that all work decently for the cost. Good for a college student like I was - just starting out and wanting food simply chopped (not pretty). Bought it a while ago and kept it for about two years.It can have trouble cutting through tough veggies like potatoes and onions, so I needed to cut them in halves or quarters to cut them. Food gets very easily stuck, and is very difficult to clean out in the sink. Not sure if it’s dishwasher friendly, as I don’t have one.",4
"I love the nesting feature, but I am constantly worried about using a very high temperature while cooking. According to the instructions it strongly suggests to use a medium flame. Also, there is a weird grayish residue between washes on the bottom exterior of the pans. I think other than scratching each other that’s the reason for the felt dividers that came with the set. I feel like it should have one more large pot lid added so you can use multiple pots simultaneously. The cold storage lids don’t snap on, so they don’t feel secure when storing food in the fridge. Easy to clean both by hand and in a dishwasher.",4
"These have heavy enough bottom to not warp when cooking at medium-high heat. Come out clean from the dishwasher. As long as you don't dunk them in cold water when they are hot, these will stay good for a while.They are good for making omelets and sunny side up eggs; or even fried potatoes for a small family. Big enough well for deglazing and reduction of sauces, but obviously you don't want to make a bechamel sauce in these pans.",4
"I have a go-to set of mixing bowls that I love. But sometimes, especially during holidays and large cooking get togethers, I want to use a different set so I am not forced to wash and dry my set of 4 so often. So, in preparation for a large gathering weekend, I bought this set. I used many of the bowls and lids for the mass cooking adventure. I was pleased with the sizes and appearance of the bowls. I was able to use them for serving some dishes too. The lids worked well. I did not use the shredding feature so I cannot comment on that.I will note that the bowls are not thick or very sturdy. I hand washed all pieces so that they would not be warped. I saw in other comments that the kids warped over time. By hand washing, I suspect that won’t happen to mine. They are not thick, I emphasize. I do not plan to use these as my sturdy, everyday pieces but they will serve well as my secondary set. The metal is shiny but I suspect it will dull and scratch over time but that is just aesthetics. I love the bottoms as they do not move when mixing. For the money, this is a great set of bowls. I would not use them daily but I recommend them for back up prep and storing.",4
Nice sharp sturdy knife! Damascus pattern is not as visible in person,4
"Talk about being duped, read everything about this knife and was convinced it was made in Japan & sold in America, but alas, yes, sold in America but ""MADE IN CHINA"". I'm really getting sick & tired of this crap, AMAZON you need to lift your game & demand that these sellers display where the item is made!!!!!!! When I find an item that I'm tempted to buy it is the first thing I look for ""where it's made"" & if it's made in China then that's a NO GO for me because I've had to much CRAP from them & the quality is disgraceful, so if an item cannot display where it's made then I'll just move along or go without.",4

"Scissors are nice quality and do well cutting but have limited use due to difficulty of cleaning. These have limited applications because they don’t come apart for thorough cleaning. Any raw meat packaging or uncooked items that can easily transmit bacteria should be avoided as the bacteria can get trapped where shears are joined. Soaking or dishwasher cleaning ultimately results in rust as water cannot be totally dried. Because of this , they’re not truly all purpose and I will need to invest in another pair that can come apart.",4
they work great and are solid! sometimes they come defective where the red string is glued and it ripps the bags.,4
I wanted one with a stand to set up when entertaining a large group for a grab and go beverage option. The height is below waist level. It is folding table height. It did the job.,4
"Easy to clean. Does a nice job air frying and baking. I haven’t used all the features yet but so far it’s worked great. The only issue is the toast feature, which really doesn’t do a good job but no toaster oven does anyway. I use a toaster instead. Nice product.",4
"This quilt is not very thick nor is the nap very thick. It definitely has a nap, but it is very low and doesn’t dramatically change color when you smooth it against the grain. The loden color I picked is dark enough to pair with my purple throw pillows as my other comforters are dark purple. Because it is not very thick, it lays flat and offers a clean look on the bed. The shams are simple without frilly edges, but I like the look. The quilt is very thin; it does not really feel as if it is filled with anything, but it has a lot of weight to it so that it is sufficient for winter use. The California King size has plenty of length and width to cover my bed and even the top of my bed skirt - please note this quilt does not come with a matching bed skirt - so it looks smooth and finished when the bed is made. I do wish this set came in a dark purple and not the lavender they offer as I’d get that color in a heartbeat as I prefer this thinner but still heavy style of bed covering. I also like that it is basically the same on both sides so that you can reverse it and it won’t look “wrong”. And the fact that it can be machine washed and dried makes it a good option for someone looking for a flatter, less puffy look for their bed. My only gripe is that it wrinkles a bit.",4
This velvet quilt is nice. It is a but thinner than I hoped but it is nice and soft. My husband likes that it is thin but I get much colder than him. It washed and dried well when I got it. I didn’t notice any issue with stitching on my set. I think it is a nice snuggly quilt especially for those with texture sensitivities.,4
"Smells good, lasts a long time, calming.",4
Didn’t think I would like these as much as I do but they’re really nice and bright. Bright enough where I can sit in the office comfortably at night without the need of turning on the room lights. These also help with out with eye strain too that I’ve noticed when using the computer for long periods of time.Getting them up and running was a breeze and it also works just as well with Alexa assistant. Plenty of preset color options to choose from or you can make your own through the Govee App.Only reason I docked a point is because the double sided adhesive strips provided with the panels are abysmal. They lasted for a day before they started falling off the wall one by one. Had to order some 3M mounting tape to get these to stick so fair warning there.Overall I’m pleased with these and many other Govee products. Way more affordable solution compared to the other alternatives. I’d definitely recommend these.,4
"The lights are really easy to install with the app guiding you, it get nice and bright and works well with google home. I just Wish the app interface was a bit more user friendly and accessible.",4
This Reed diffuser has pleasant scent. I like how it has a decorative flower pattern not just sticks. It can be put in any room and the entire room smells nice. It comes in a nice box so it’s even perfect to gift to friends or family.,4
"I recently purchased the Reed Diffuser Set (Starshine1), and I’m really enjoying the fresh, pleasant scent it adds to my home. The fragrance is light and uplifting, with a nice balance that isn’t overpowering — it creates a calming atmosphere whether in the living room, bedroom, or even the bathroom. It’s the perfect scent for daily use and definitely enhances the ambiance in any room.The design of the diffuser itself is lovely and fits well with my home decor. I also appreciate the rattan reeds, which are stylish and functional. The aromatherapy effect is subtle yet effective, making it perfect for spaces where you want a gentle, consistent fragrance without it being too strong.My only minor critique is that I wish the scent-drawing straws (the reeds) were a bit larger. I’ve noticed that the scent doesn’t seem to diffuse as strongly as I expected, and I think larger reeds would help draw the fragrance out more effectively and fill the room with a more noticeable aroma. That said, it still works well for a more subtle scent and is a great option if you prefer a lighter fragrance.Overall, this is a lovely diffuser set with a great fragrance, and it’s a perfect decorative gift as well. I just wish the reeds were slightly thicker for better scent diffusion. Still, I’m very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others looking for a nice, relaxing room scent.",4
"First off, they are much smaller than I thought they’d be. I’ve only used one, as I needed something to store my towels on in my bathroom. It’s easy enough to install but even following the instructions, it ended up lopsided. No one notices but me..but it bugs me. I don’t like how flimsy it feels. I wouldn’t trust it for anything heavy.",4
"Instructions were clear, and it was nice that it specified the size of drill bits needed. But with the included hardware there is quite a bit of vertical flex to the bracket once mounted as it comes with countersunk screws which the bracket wasn't made for. After finding one of my shelves in particular was too saggy, I bought new screws with wide flat heads (see picture) and they are much more secure.It would also be nice if there was an included way to secure the shelf on the bracket - it just slides on and off. I'm considering whether I want to glue it, or perhaps inset a neodymium magnet on the shelf back so it would hold to the bracket.",4
Love the design and the fact that it melts the candle without getting smokey or sutty. Much safer than an actual lit candle. Just be careful when handling once it's turned on. Keep out of reach of children and pets.,4
My only complaint is that the little basket for the toothbrushes is skinnier metal than the rest and it doesn't stay on the hooks as well. The rest of them are perfect and look really nice. They hold a lot more than what we have to put in them.,4
"These wooden art signs are each a different size. When you store them, they nest inside each other. They are meant to be displayed on a table-top. They do not have hooks on the back to hang, but there is room to add a narrow one if you wanted to. The graphics are simple, in red and blue on a white background, but perfect for baseball (especially if you have an All-Stars display!). The slogans are those that baseball fans all know and love and are pretty timeless. My son is on two baseball teams, so I display these on the sideboard in our foyer with his team photos during the season.",4
I have this wreath on the front door and it will work for the summer. I have other wreaths for the other seasons. I like the way it looks and am pleased with it. I have to agree with other reviewers that the bow is very flimsy. I haven’t changed it yet but will do so in the future. Other than that it’s a nice looking wreath at a good price.,4
I have placed this near a window and the light shines through beautifully.,4
Very cute but smaller than expected.,4
Awesome pc for gaming gets around 240-300 fps in fortnite and never freezes all of a sudden. I recommend as for a first pc-,4
Wireless charger and headset plug dosent work other than that great pc,4
I like the support team response to a small issue. The repair was swift and great workmanship. My son loves his gaming computer and the lights around the computer match his room decor.,4
"Bought this for my 10 year old son. It is fairly fast out of the box. Runs his current games (Minecraft, Roblox, etc..) with zero issues. Looking forward to him getting into more robust games in the future so I can teach him how to upgrade his computer. This gives us a solid base that fits all his current needs and also allows us to build as we go. Big bonus is the looks. He absolutely loves the looks of this machine (little too flashy for my taste).",4
"it’s definitely worth the buy for the money. I’ve been playing on it for about an hour and have had no lag when it comes to opening things downloading things or even watching videos. The only thing that it can’t do (which is why i gave it 4 stars) and if you’re looking for this don’t buy, but it does not record gaming videos very well, which is what I wanted when I originally purchased, but I’m still happy with the product because it runs most of my games very well.",4
"The pc is good, third gen I5 performs better than expected even tho ddr3 ram starts to show its age, its still reliable. I only added a low profile card, The GTX 1050Ti from Zotac. It can run GTA Online between 50 to 75 fps (I cant see more beacause of the 75hz monitor), Fortnite runs perfectly on Performance mode, high settings, expect a few stutters for the few first games. For the E-sports titles such as Valorant and CSGO you'll have no problem running them. Its a pretty good computer for the price to performance ratio. I bought my gtx1050ti from Facebook Marketplace for 65 CAD$. BTW, I bought a different mouse with side buttons from Walmart for $6",4
"My previous desk only accommodated laptop. I was gifted a PC and needed to find something bigger but simple, as I had limited space. This fit that description perfectly. It's sturdy, sleek and affordable. My favorite perk is the built in power connections that allow USB and prongs. The lights are great and I like to match then with my keyboard. Very happy with this buy.",4
"Easy to build, took me about an hour total, instructions are very easy to follow. The desk itself is pretty sturdy, and holds all of my gaming setup no problem, with a good amount of arm room.I would’ve liked the desk to to be one single board instead of 3 smaller ones you combine to make the desk. Also the shelf to hold my computer is a tad bit small, with about an inch of my computer not being supported by the shelf it’s supposed to sit on, but I don’t think it will fall off unless it is kicked or bumped hard.The LED lights do not come with a sticky back, and the ones provided aren’t very good. So I’d recommend going and buying some double sided tape beforehand!Otherwise I am very happy with the product and the outcome! Great value for its price point.",4
"Bought this mic strictly because I was in need of a mic, mic arm stand etc. But what's even better is that some of my friends have the more expensive microphones like blue yeti and the 100-200 dollar mics for podcasts/recording music etc. and this one is right there with them I feel like. Maybe i'll notice more fractional differences down the road but as a overall mic, its great.The voice quality is very clear, it sounds crisp, no cutting out, no distortion, just a smooth voice with very little background noise. I use it for gaming, talking with friends on discord, even recording some vocals to see what my voice can really do lol. I guess I'm a singer now! It actually sounds better than I thought.It has soft touch buttons to turn volume of the mic up and down, holding it mutes. It just feels like such a satisfying touch.The design is clean, its the same size all around basically, doesn't feel outdated, too big and cheap, it feels like $100+ mic made with good durable parts and nice edges. Love the basically all black design.Overall, like I was saying, now that I have the mic, I would have just paid that much for the mic itself but since I was in need of the mic arm stand mostly, I went with this. Also though, I got a shock mount which actually is nice for not hearing any noise from things touching my desk, etc. I didn't know the value of this until I tried with and without it. The mic arm stand is nice, does exactly what it needs to do, use to have a super cheap 10 dollar one and it just wouldn't move smooth and this one just feels like a crane and its nice.Definitly will buy again, going to pick another one up soon for my girlfriend, built her a computer recently as well and it will be a good combo to have.",4
It's a Christmas gift for my daughter so it hasn't been opened but the pricing and shipping were great,4
"Shipment was delayed supposed to come in on sunday came on Thursday. Did come in thought UPS not amazon. At first of putting in power cord and HDMI cord ( HDMI cord did work) it would not turn on, but after inserting and plugging the power cord of the xbox off and on several times it did eventually work and then turned on. When it turned on it did restart itself twice but after worked completely normal. After all that no issues came from the xbox. Games like college football and Jedi Survivor has worked smoothly and download speed runs fast. Actually would recommend especially during prime day. A Xbox S 1TB was 350 no shipping while this on prime day in 2024 was 400 with shipping so definitely worth but can be risky with all the other reviews in place. Risk it though because this is way more worth it.",4
"If you want the new gen Xbox’s but can’t get the X, this is for you.",4
"The media could not be loaded. I bought this as a surprise for my son, as I was redoing his media room. Not only is it aesthetically pleasing, but super multifunctional. He can charge many things on this device. We love the lights on it. You can keep it one solid color. You can change it to a rotation of the colors too if you like. This has been great for minimizing cords and chargers and cables. Also, it keeps my son from just tossing his headphones down in a chair. This actually helps them last longer.",4
"Well, I wasn't planning on getting an 8th gen console. I was really in the state of thought, that it wouldn't be much of an upgrade from 7th gen to 8th, like it was jumping from 6th gen to 7th, or 5th gen to 6th. But. I had to reconsider since there where games coming out for the 8th gen consoles I really wanted, so I went on ahead and pulled the trigger. You only live once, amiright? My opinion about the leap from 7th gen to 8th is not that huge, is still the same. It really isn't that much of an upgrade. Just the likes of Xbox One and PS4 has smoother textures and graphics, and can handle more AI and activity than their predecessors. But hey, we're reaching the climax of how much we can do with this technology so it's a given.Now, that I have my views of 8th generation out the way, lemme get to the main course. The Xbox One.I enjoy it. I'm still trying to work around it and get to know it. Know the little new features that is. It's kind of like a 360, but with more. More downloading than the 360 as well. Just to play a DVD, I had to download an app just to make it work. I know. It isn't about watching movies, it's about the gaming. But still. Since previous systems just let you pop in the disk and play your movies, without having to worry installing features is kind of the point. Pop movie in Xbox. Movie plays. Pop movie into 360, movie play. Pop movie into Xbox One. Opps! You've gotta download an app for that! I know it's free. I know it's quick. But it's still stupid. Apps also have a knack for freezing sometimes. Like the youtube app. I'll be in the middle of watching a video, and it freezes. And I can't shut the tab down. The only thing left to do is to shut down the console and turn it back on. Scrolling threw the dashboard has a bit of a lag to it vs the 360. Maybe do to more plastered content? I don't know. I know. Stupid thing to nitpick about. Grain of salt people. But I'm sure these things won't matter with a few more patches and updates.Now that I've got the kinks out the way. Lemme get to the meaty part. The gaming experience. I haven't put too much playtime into it. But so fair, I say it's fun factor is very good. I had a good time playing Forza 6. More games are on the way so I can give this system some more playtime and open it up. This is going to be short since I just the console a few days ago and I need to get more in depth. But so far. No problems with the gaming aspect. Kind of funny thinking back in 2013, people where saying the Xbox One wasn't ""for the gamers"". It most certainly is.physical durability.Unlike last generation, within I year I would start hearing horror stories of reliability issues with the consoles of old. 2 years has already passed since these consoles had been out, I haven't heard any REALLY bad problems with these consoles yet. A few PS4's and Xbox One's bricked at launch, but only a slim few. The rest of time was smooth sailing for these consoles. Sure. The Xbox One isn't the prettiest looking thing in the world, but certainly isn't the ugliest. Like the original Xbox, this thing was built to last. There are huge vents everywhere. From the top to the sides, so no worries about overheating from hours of gameplay. Plus, the thing is really quiet. It doesn't make a peep. Unlike the old Xbox's, the One is so quiet you could hear a fly fart. The 360's fan roars more than Mufasa from The Lion King. I love how I can finally have some peace and quiet, when I have a console on. That's a welcomed change. Controller is not that shabby either. Although the 360 controller will always be my personal favorite. The 360 controller feels better than the One's by leaps and bounds. But when not compared to the 360 controller, the One's controller is really comfy and fitting. No huge complaints there.The verdict.I've only had the Xbox One for a few days, and I'm already loving it. It's not perfect. But it's not horrible like some people want you to believe either. (I'm looking at you PS4 fanboys.) The Xbox One is a fine investment that will give its owner hours of fun playtime for casual and hardcore gamers alike. Don't be expecting huge graphical leaps with these consoles. But don't think it's under powered either. The Xbox One certainly has redeemed itself, after it's horror show of a launch two years ago. So many people expected it to fail, but here we are. People are warming up to it and nodding in respect for Microsoft and the Xbox One turning around for the better.4/5",4
"I've been obsessed with it since it arrived. The seemless user interface and sleek design is absolutely captivating. From 10 percent, the phone will take 4 hours to charge if you have a regular adapter. It will hold a charge for a great amount of time. Pairs very well with Echo Buds, which I also highly recommend for audiophiles who look for balance between their music and their surroundings. The phone does come alone, without the promo for the $100 gift card, so double check your cart to make sure you chose the correct option.Update on having the phone for two months:This one of the best phones out there! The functionality is superb. However, it can heat up when fast charging and when using a couple of high functioning apps at a time. Fast charge take an hour and a half. The phone does not slow down, but the heat makes the phone a little uncomfortable to hold after, even with a case.",4
"I got this smartphone as an alternative to a.) Getting my iPhone 12 pro scrubbed.b.) buying another iPhone.To explain, I got hacked while using my iPhone and my bank wanted me to get it scrubbed in case there was some sort of malware on it. So rather than driving 40 minutes and paying $190 to get that done along with the paperwork certifying it was done, I just bought a brand new Samsung A-15 from Amazon. It performs well and satisfied my bank. Price is probably the .ain't factor in my purchasing this phone. I think I owned a Galaxy S-21 before, and I like this A-15 better. It has no water resistance, one speaker, but it has decent cameras and is fast enough loading internet sites. It's a tad big and heavy, but the + side is a larger screen. There is no inductive charging, but it uses a 25 watt charger that makes charging relatively fast. Also, the battery lasts a long time. I think it's 5000 miliamps. I've had it last over 3 days, so that's a plus. If you are an iOS user and have Apple Mail, that can be challenging, but once you set everything up, it's no big deal.",4
"I received this yesterday and have tried it out for nearly 24 hours now. I will be using this as a back up phone.The pluses.Nice big clear and bright screen.I like the case and the color. It looks and feel quite decent,Good, responsive touchscreen with good colors.Good wifi and bluetooth. On screen keyboard is also easy to use.Large battery, I charged it to 100 % last night and its still at 70%Good sound quality and fairly loud speakers.Negatives.There is some lag but that is in comparison to my “high end” main phone but I consider it to be more than acceptable.The cameras have great colors are appear to be over processed.If this was for use as my main shooter, it would not be acceptable but for the bargain price, and considering that this is budget phone, both front and rear cameras will suffice.Not too keen on the side finger print reader, it does work and actually responds quite fast, I don’t care for the location.So as a budget back up phone, there are some negatives but I can live with them all.Not; the first two photos were taken with the rear came at high resolution. The third was taken with the front facing camera. The last two were taken indoors in a restaurant setting on high resolution.I quite like this phone. I had been considering a 5 year old phone for a back up…. It still had really good specs but I was concerned about the battery and how much longer it would work. Also there would not be any security updates on an older phone but this is from 2024 and has already done several updates since I first powered it on, and it is due to be upgraded to Android 14 later this summer. ( I mention this because there are surely other folks looking for a budget back up phone.)Also, since I don’t play any games, I cant offer any opinions in that respect.For a back up phone, its ideal and I recommend it!",4
A budget phones serves all your needs for a second phone. Bit slow.,4
"Except the provided wireless controller. The left control stick was not functioning correctly and the controller would shut off on it's own.No problem as i had perfectly functioning controllers on hand.The important part was the console itself which happened to function perfectly. No issues or hiccups. I can now enjoy my 360 games again as my old console has been dead for several months,...though it provided over 11 years of service....i hope this renewed unit can provide the same.",4
A liked it but was a little on the small side and only red color.,4
"3D best in a dark room, less dark equals less crisp design. Best to have at eye level or looking at it straight on, when deciding where to place.",4
My grandson loved this.,4
Definetly works but you have to apply so much and one coffee and your back to stained teeth,4
Definetly works but you have to apply so much and one coffee and your back to stained teeth,4
It lightens my teeth a shade after several uses. However when I skip any days using it my teeth go back to their normal coloring.,4
As expected,4
"I have been using this for a few weeks now, and have not seen any significant results. I do realize that there are a lot of variables, and people have different diets, different brushing rituals, etc. So maybe others will see more significant results. The taste is not bad in my opinion (slight mint flavor). I would personally not buy this at the current price point due to the lack of results for me.",4
"I wanted to try this toothpaste as I do not want to spend a fortune on tooth whitening, and because I wanted to try a milder version of the dark charcoal toothpastes that have been around for a bit of time now but shouldn’t be used everyday because they have the potential to damage the enamel.The toothpaste comes in a simple tube with a screw cap and an initially sealed opening. The expiration date is on the box it comes in and is well into 2026, so no worries about taking a bit of time to use this paste.Expressing the toothpaste is almost too easy as the toothpaste seems thinner consistency-wise than other toothpastes. It seems to do a good job cleaning teeth, and although I wouldn’t say it has a pleasant taste, it is also not a bad taste.Rinsing it with just a bit of water by swishing it around gets rid of the paste quickly and I must say I am surprised that all the grittiness from the paste washes out just like that. I am not sure about the whitening effect yet, but my teeth feel clean and my mouth refreshed after each use.",4
"We loved this when we first got it. Our kid has a hard time opening toothpaste caps but this made toothbrushing easier and fun for our 6 yr old. But after some uses, it gets clogged since there’s no way to actually get all the toothpaste out unless you remove and rinse it every time.",4
Tastes great. It will get stuck in the tube. Not happy about that!,4
"way too expensive for absolutely no reason, but it is the only one our toddler wants to use so....",4
"No he doesn't want to use any of the more mundane and boring easily gotten mint toothpastes, so here we have a winner! Fantastic packaging, swift delivery and great taste. This could be the difference for my 10 yr old having teeth or not by the time his 15! very happy.",4
"Right after I use it, I notice a difference, but not sure it lasts. I’m not unhappy with it… I just can’t tell if I love it. It’s a cheaper alternative to other products.",4
Really works for a quick teeth brightening! I use before a night out and it does a good job for a quick touch up. Doesn’t really have a taste.,4
"This is my second jar. The taste is something to get use to. The essential oils do not cover the taste. You have to get use to baking soda. The perks, it’s great for sensitivity. Clove is wonderful. No foam, hard to brush that way but you adjust.",4
"I'm not a cheap person. And though this stuff works great, I'll be looking elsewhere for a cheaper, but comprable quality.",4
"Some of the tablets have partially disintegrated in the jar or broken into bits which is unfortunate, but the ones that are whole work well, very strong minty flavors. When you chew the toothpaste up only chew like 2-3 times the toothbrush will do the rest for you. It's definitely different to get used to but it works.",4
"I wanted to like these. I didn't mind them. They suds nice. I just felt like they fell short. I would consider buying them again, but at the moment I am shopping around. They do clean your teeth, are better for the environment that tubes, and they're great for traveling.",4
"This product is well-made and has excellent form, but the function was off for me. That being said, the product description is accurate; it's an ear irrigation flushing system, nothing more, nothing less. The tip disperses three streams of water that quickly empty the water cup into your ear canal. For me, at least, the process was not messy as the exiting water fell into the sink and not on my clothing. There are two buttons on the machine; get familiar with their function and positions if you're operating the machine by yourself. Otherwise, you might accidentally increase the pressure or prematurely start the machine, spraying water all over your bathroom.Now, back to the function: I was expecting something more, like pulsating or spiral streams of water. I believe I have clean ears, and I did not see any earwax removed after using the machine. After using the machine, I was able to extract earwax manually with an ear canal scraping wand. I don't think water alone would remove this ordinary earwax unless it came into direct contact with a pressurized water stream. Since there are only three fixed streams, only three spots on the outer ear canal are directly exposed to the full stream cleaning effect; the rest of the ear is exposed only to a water flush. If you are the in the market for ear flush irrigation machine this is the product for you.",4
"This ear irrigation system is compact and portable enough to take with you on vacation. The water chamber is emptied out the spout in 3 streams of water that do not rotate, pulse, or in any way agitate the earwax. The water gets warm, but not really hot enough or strong enough to dislodge stubborn wax. But this is probably a good thing because if it was too strong or directed into the ear drum it might cause damage and we wouldn't want that. It is good enough to help warm and loosen the wax so you can get it out with a scraper or to help assist the stubborn wax to come out of your ear when you can't get it with an ear scraper. My son had a heavy wax build up when he was small and the irrigation system the doctor used was huge in comparison to this item. If I would have had this back then the process would have been so much easier. But just remember to take it for what it is, an ear irrigation system. It just heats up and pushes water into your ear. It isn't a jet stream or a power washer.",4
"Doctors were flushing my ears once a year, because of a family bend in the ear canal. Still not perfect but helps and is easy to use.",4
"They work like advertised. Its bristles are about as stiff as a hard bristled toothbrush. The different sized heads are useful as well. The smallest head was especially useful for corners. The only reason I didn't give this a five star is because I really couldn't use it with the Pink Stuff. The bristles or motor just wasn't strong enough to cut through the pink paste. It works great with Ajax or Comet, just not the Pink Stuff. (I love the Pink Stuff btw.)",4
I love the ear wax removal micro camera for getting the places and seeing what's built up in the ear. I have had really itchy ears so this is great to get in and help clean out the itchy areas without causing harm or losing the tip of a cotton swab. I love the accessory tools that come with this for extra cleaning ability.,4
"This Ear Wax Removal Tool Camera is great to have as getting the inner ear visual is super cool and it includes different tools to remove the wax. However, this is an easy way for people wanting to dig deeper and deeper into the ear, which can cause a lot of harm to the eardrum -- leave that to a professional. It's neat to own and, for other purposes, great to have a micro camera.",4
"My opinion is that this steam cleaner is perfect for anyone who is looking for a method of cleaning their house that does not involve the use of chemicals, particularly for removing tough filth and grime. The fact that it comes with a variety of attachments is a significant advantage since it enables the cleaner to be adaptable enough to deal with a variety of surfaces and chores. The fact that this steam cleaner is both lightweight and small is one of the things that I particularly like about it. I believe that the mobility of this product is a significant benefit, particularly when it comes to cleaning areas such as restrooms or even the inside of your vehicle. It is simple to transport from one room to another. The deep gray color gives it a sleek appearance, and the ergonomic handle makes it easy to use for extended periods of time, which is ideal for cleaning applications. I am grateful that it warms up in a relatively short amount of time; it requires just a few minutes to get ready for use, and I did not get the impression that I was waiting around to get started. The set consists of twelve components, which include nozzles, a brush, and attachments that are designed for a variety of surfaces. The results of using the little brush to clean the grout in my bathroom were extremely impressive, and I am quite pleased with the outcomes. Because of the pressured steam, I was able to remove the filth that I had previously battled to remove with more conventional ways in a short amount of time. I believe that the steam is strong enough to remove debris that has been adhered to surfaces without the need for an excessive amount of physical effort, and I believe that it makes cleaning more effective in general.",4
"Works very good in getting down in the vent area. Was surprised at how much lint it cleaned out, which is comforting as I don't want a dryer fire.",4
These are long which works well. I use one for cleaning the dryer vent. I’ve cleaned it from inside the machine & from the outside vent. I use the other for cleaning out from under the fridge & the oven. The only negative for these is that they are difficult to clean all the lint & gunk off of the bristles.,4
"The Holikme 2 Pack Dryer Vent Cleaner Kit is a game-changer for anyone looking to improve the performance of their cloth dryer and safeguard their home against potential fire hazards.

By doing so, it not only enhances dryer efficiency but also reduces the risk of fire hazards in your home—a critical consideration for maintaining a safe living environment. But the benefits don't stop there. This versatile kit can also be used to clean dust and pet hair under furniture and appliances, making it a valuable tool for overall household cleanliness and maintenance.",4
"I love that this bends at different angles and that you can use it as a short handle or long one. The quality is great and it is very sturdy. It doesn’t bog down at all while you’re using it trying to get grime out of corners but I feel like the bristles could have been better. After one time of use, the bristles were pretty bent up and some were coming out of the brush. It is pretty powerful and lightweight. It’s a great value for what what you pay for it. There are multiple speeds but I feel like the highest speed works the best. It definitely gets grime off of things without having to hand scrub them but if you have a tough job, it won’t work well.",4
"This item gets a 4 because it is a great concept, long pole with a head that shifts so you can clean baseboards and a reusable head that you can remove and clean. Well, someone can remove and clean, not me. The cloth is really stuck on there. The plastic head is very flimsy and unscrews itself from the pole as you use it. I had to stop and screw the head back in three times while cleaning the baseboards.That said, the baseboard cleaner does a great job on a difficult task. The head could be more study and the cleaning cloth easier to remove, but the concept is a winner.",4
"It is handy to do baseboards with but flimsy pole, lean too much on it and would break.",4
"This gizmo does save one from bending to clean the baseboards. I do have a complaint though. The cleaning pad is really difficult to remove from the unit as the Velcro is incredibly strong which makes it difficult for arthritic hands. Secondly, even though I squeezed the water out of the pad before attaching it to the pole, I found that, when applying pressure to the baseboards to clean them, water dripped out of the pad necessitating having to get down to wipe up the wet. The cleaning pad is made out of some unusual fabric and it does not want to hold the water you put on it.",4
Seems to actually work. Not painful. Easy to use. Would buy again.,4
"Smells like chemicals sorta, not super intense and it’s gone once it dries but still, not what I would expect. It does peel really well and my skin does feel great.",4
"First of all, I want to say that these are EXTREMELY cool. I have never seen anything like this and for someone who will lay in bed to binge watch an entire series on Netflix, these are super nifty for avoiding any kinks in your neck. I actually thought it was a fluke because there is no way you could watch a show clearly with something like this, but IT IS LEGIT. The image is a bit smaller though.Cons:- Heavy -- considering these are to be worn like glasses, they are relatively heavy and can be super uncomfortable if worn for too long, so it's not ideal for long-term use.- Vision impairment? I am not sure how to explain it, but since you're technically staring at a reflection, it kind of messes with your eyes, in my opinion. I am not sure how it is when reading, but if you wear them while watching tv, then it almost feels like you're going cross eyed. Again, only happens if you wear them for too long. I've actually used them before bed if I couldn't fall asleep because it almost makes your eyes feel droopy and tired...Overall, it's super inventive and a really unique product, and despite the cons, I would still recommend it considering how inexpensive it is! But if you are prone to getting headaches, I wouldn't buy it.",4
Great buy for the price will buy again.,4
"These glasses are really pretty slick. De to the multi-focal lenses, I can wear them with or without my contacts, so I don't have to have different glasses (yes, my contacts do not completely fix my reading...)They don't sit quite right on the nose, so they do leave a mark when you wear them for any length of time. And they are NOT fashionable! They do, however, work great, and the price is very reasonable. Definitely recommend.",4
"For the price, these glasses are a steal. The materials feel high-quality and the craftsmanship is excellent!So far So good!",4
A good value but not very sturdy s little more fragile than expected. But great price so are more disposable,4
"The instructions specifically said not to walk around with them on, but the kids couldn't resist. They're a bit heavy on your nose but they did really help with neck fatigue while crocheting for long periods.",4
"This review is for: Virtegasas Horizontal Lazy Glasses Bed Prism Spectacles Lazy Readers Glasses Periscope Eyeglasses Upgraded Prism Glasses - For Reading and Watching TV in Bed While Lying FlatGot these yesterday. Pretty wild! They really do work. I have to say that it's pretty wild how your vision is separated through these two tunnels and your eyes still put the two images together, perfectly, like it's one image. Just a fun anatomy thing, I guess.I tried them two ways, close up and more of a distance. Laid flat in bed and looked at my phone. Vivid and crystal clear, just as if you were looking directly at your phone. While you can see a little but of something down the center of your vision in a way, it doesn't interfere with the object you're looking at and you can still see it clearly.Then, while still laying flat in bed, I tried watching TV. My TV is on a wall that is probably about 13 feet or so from my eyes. Still, the image was clear and I could see it perfectly.The only reason for 4 stars is that in both cases, the image is smaller and seems farther away than it is. I think this is just the physics involved with the image being reflected and there is probably no avoiding it. It's not too bad, but it is very obvious that the image you're looking at is smaller and farther away, seemingly. Maybe it's not fair to dock the product if this illusion is unavoidable, but 5 stars on these might convey that they reflect the image just as if it would be if you were looking at it directly, but it does not.Price is very reasonable at (currently) $13.99.I feel that these could be extremely useful in certain circumstances where mobility is an issue! If someone had neck troubles, etc., this would be a great solution.If I could give these 4.2 or 4.5, I would.I hope this was helpful.",4
"I love these and definitely recommend to anyone and everyone! Kind of heavy on the bridge of my nose and on my ears, but I'm not used to wearing glasses regularly so that is probably the cause.",4
"These bifocals stickers are good quality, rigid material, not flimsy and work great.......once you get them to adhere to your glasses. I ordered 2 sets and three of the stickers adhered fairly easily but the fourth one would not stay stuck. I had to reapply several times, which was easy to do, and the top edge of the sticker just will not stick. I finally decided it was as good as it was going to get and since I could still see thru the bifocal to read etc. I just quit trying to get it perfectly stuck. These are basically like putting a screen protector on your phone or tablet and have the same issues such as bubbles. There is also a definite right and wrong side to the sticker because they have a slight curve to them. If you have completely flat lenses on your glasses, not sure these would work. But once I got the stickers to adhere to my sunglasses they worked fine and I am happy with my purchase.",4
"They’re al little cheaply made, but perfect for what I wanted and the price. I use them all of the time. There are some blind spots and my glasses have fogged up, but I do recommend them!",4
"I bought these 2.5 diopter flip glasses for doing electronics work. I was tired of having to search my messy work area to find the other pair of glasses when I needed to change between reading my computer screen and being able to see what I was working on. That meant switching between some 1.5 glasses and and my 4.0. Since my search skills are horrible (I swear I can't find my own feet), this ate up a lot of time and patience.I love these! They are convenient and clear. They are easy to put on my drug store reading glasses. They work just like having two different pairs, without the searching pain.Yes, they are a little heavy. What would you expect. They don't have an anti-gravity mechanism to make them weightless. I had to tighten up the ear pieces on my 1.75's so the assembled pair wouldn't slide down my nose. But, they're not so heavy that they are uncomfortable.I need to get my wife her own pair for her beading work.",4
"I bought these lenses in January 2018. It is now August 2018 & I need to replace them. So I got about 7 months of HEAVY use for just under $13 -- not bad at all, but not quite great.The glasses are reasonably scratch resistant. Fairly light in weight so... comfortable to use. I flip them up & down a lot -- down for reading, up for conversations & other activities. The spring holding the lens when flipped up is still working just fine. However, the spring that holds the lens in place when it is flipped down, so as to be against my glasses for reading purposes -- that spring has lost some power. As a result, the lenses ""sag"" away from my glasses, just a quarter inch or so, when I tilt my head to read or do cloose work. It's a minor annoyance but spoils my concentration at times. So I just bought a replacent pair of lenses.The lenses themselves are great. Flip lenses are a good idea for people who, like me, make frequent shifts between close work & other activities. With lighter use these lenses would surely last longer. Even so... 7 months of heavy use for under $13 -- I can live with that.Aloha to all from Hawaii.",4
I do wear these all the time. I like that they have a pair of sunglasses too because I am always reading outside.I can use them only in my home for the 'one power' like looking up at the TV from my computer or book. It does not work when I'm driving at all.,4
"These are built pretty well. Not sure how they work. They do not seem to adjust from low to high, but I can wear them all day or just to read, and all is in focus. A mystery! Still a huge value here.",4
"These have lasted the longest Ive ever had a pair...going on 3 years hanging on my shirt collar every day. a little pricey, but you get what you pay for.",4
"The glasses fit great and work well for my intended purposes. The only problem I had was that the left temple was bent and almost broken. I was able to fix this without breaking the temple. The packaging was a ziploc bag inside an envelope, with no real protection against being crushed.",4
Fit well and and are as described. Non- Bi-focal readers that allow for ease of use.,4
"They look good, but the plastic lenses are definitely lower quality and blurrier than glass.",4
These glasses fit the description. They do have hinged eat pieces and open & close smoothly. They come with a pouch to keep them in. The only thing I don't like is the lack of packaging/shipping protection. They shipped like the picture above in a thin bag inside a standard Amazon envelope. If the glasses don't come with better protection I would have appreciated they be in a bubble wrap bag. Because of that I'm giving them 4/5 stars.,4
"The color and style are pretty. Because the glasses are big they are heavy. They are good quality for the money. They slip too far down my nose, so that is why I gave them 4 stars. Maybe my nose or face is too thin for the glasses not sure. For me the nose arch could be thinner to stay up higher on my nose and face. I’m going to try to get used to them, because the are pretty. Also they come with a small amount of accessories like a neck cord, and a lens wiping cloth.",4
They were just what I wanted. Ty,4
"While these were super cheap, I love them. I've looked for rimless, round readers forever. They are very light and I realize not particularly sturdy but for the price they are well worth it. I plan to order a couple more pair when the first pair inevitably breaks. I'm rough on glasses...",4
"These are REALLY Nice glasses, and I'm really pleased. They have a real professional/ executive look to them, which is what I was going for. The lenses are crystal-clear, with NO reflections whatsoever. Everything is very much in FOCUS! I just wish the arms were a bit more substantial.. because as they are, they are just thin wire-like arms. So I have to handle these with utmost care, because they seem very delicate. So I keep them in the case whenever I'm not using them (or in the shirt pocket). Otherwise, I do recommend these Nice glasses.",4
no side rims to block your vision area which is why i got them.,4
They work and come with extra batteries. They do make fine work easier but definitely mess with your vision if not focused on something near by.,4
"I like to work on crafts and my aging eyes make having reading glasses essential to being able to see close up. Adequate lighting is also important. The Lighted Reading Glasses seemed like the perfect combo. The glasses come with their own storage bags and cleaning cloths. The set also includes extra batteries which is a nice addition. Over all the glasses feel cheaply made. The frames are fairly flexible and feel like they would break without much effort. The lights however are bright and do light up the space right in front of them. The lights work independently from each other allowing the wearer to use either light alone or both together. The on/off switch is a little switch the sticks out on the underside of the arms and is moved back and forth from the on and off position. These will work nicely for up close crafting, but I don't think they will replace my usual cheap dollar store readers for every day use.",4
"The media could not be loaded. I decided to give these magnified readers a try to see if they might be a good option for reading or working on an art project in bed while my partner is sleeping and not wanting to disturb them.I didn't expect much but these exceeded my expectations. They are bright wherever I am looking but are not bright off to the side. A light on each side behind the hinge has a small switch to turn the light on and off. One light is more than sufficient for most tasks.The temples are a bit bulky, especially near the hinge they aren't something I notice in my field of vision or feel any noticeable weight difference when wearing. The frames feel like low-quality plastic so I don't expect them to hold up long term. The magnification works well and surprised me as I always find this to be the biggest issue with magnified readers. I don't find myself straining or sitting closer or further away than I do with my regular readers. Each pair comes with a nice drawstring eyeglass case, too. It's a decent set if you're looking for this type of feature.",4
"My first try with progressives. I got tired of the ""on and off"" of my glasses in class. So far these are wonderful! Wish I had tried them earlier. These particular frames are much better than I had expected. I was expecting fairly poor quality, but good enough to try at such a low price. If I had not liked them or if progressives did not work for me, I would not have felt badly about the cost. However, they are cute, don't slip off my face, and seem well-made. I will be buying another set! No need for more expensive frames, Recommend.Update: afterwards I realized I had ordered the wrong magnification. Exchange was very easy and now I have the correct magnification. Appreciated the great customer service!",4
These glasses work great for the computer and sewing. Much better than trying to make do with bifocals. While the distance vision is not clear mid and close up are perfect.,4
"I got these to save my neck while crocheting, and they are excellent. The only thing is the lenses are quite heavy, and the nose piece area isn’t very curved, so they don’t sit on my nose as comfortably as regular glasses and the weight puts pressure on my nose. I may get a different pair if I can find a lighter option, but otherwise I’ll be using these and taking breaks for my nose!",4
They work great! Such a relief on the neck when reading or crocheting for long periods of time. Slightly heavy but great value,4
They put the sticker on the arm and I cannot get it off.,4
The sunglasses were super cute. I loved them. I dropped them once on my kitchen floor and they broke past repair. Not the plastic but the cheap metal hinges.,4
"They look vintage, fit comfortably and are made well. Was disappointed that they did not come with an eyeglass holder. Not coming with a holder/ case just added an additional cost on my end. Most readers/ cheaters I have purchased on Amazon come with their cases/ sleeves. I was lucky the glasses arrived in one piece because they were shipped in a plastic bag inside an Amazon bag with nothing to protect them in the mail.",4
"Added these to that collection of reading specs you leave lying here and there in your workplace and home. With their tortoiseshell frames, these achieve the retro-professor look I wanted. Non-adjustable bridge still fits firmly further down my nose, for the imperious glower. Optical glass perhaps not the best: lenses are a bit loosely mounted, the reason for deducting one star.",4
"Good overall, a little heavy on the nose",4
"I liked the idea of this product because I like to read in bed, and the idea of not having to roll back and forth for comfort was appealing, as was the idea of not having to hold my phone above my head to see. Unfortunately, it makes me a bit motion sick to use it while reading, and the glasses are quite heavy, so laying on my side is awkward. It is great for watching TV shows while laying in bed though, for some reason the motion sickness doesn’t affect me with that. I liked the product though, and it’s a fun gimmick to mess with your family.",4
"I have received several compliments, but they really don’t get dark enough to call them really good sunglasses. They are very good glasses for reading.",4
"I had to have the 1st pair replaced...the frame mounts for the nose pieces was lose..a rivet kind of attachment and not a screw so there was no way to tighten. The replacement pair seems fine in that regard. My issues are not major but are perhaps more about how I need for them to work. The bifocal part is fine...but the clear portion of the lense above the bifocal is if anything distracting. Granted, at this price I don't expect perfect optical clarity but they just seem to not be in the right spot all the time. As for comfort, they seem to be a little tight on the back of my ears but I'm betting an adjustment will help with that. Again...this is probably more me and what I need for them to do. They are extremely light weight, seem to be made well, and for the bifocal part are great...",4
"Obviously prescription sunglasses would be best. Having said that, they do enable better near vision than nothing, when, like me, you don't really need glasses for daylight driving.",4
Seems cheaply made. Yet clarity is good. Serves the purpose as readers.,4
"I ordered a pair of SOLPRO Super Light Reading Glasses, but I'm a bit disappointed in the quality of the lenses.",4
"I really liked the low profile of these reading glasses. I needed them to put under my safety glasses at work, and I thought these might work out.Although I liked the design, they were not the right fit for my safety glasses, which have a more rounded contour over the eyes and forehead.I decided to keep them in my purse, for the off chances when I need to read a menu or sign something. However, when I last tried to use them, I pulled them out of my purse pocket to find them broken. They had snapped over the bridge of the nose.Oh well. (I ended up going out and finding some readers for work at a local budget store.)",4
"I bought this before the summer. Now, the summer is totally ended and winter even begins, I want to share some about this AC. I put this AC in my less than 200 ft^2 living room; however, when the sun really burns during noon on the hottest days, you can feel the coolness and only where it blows cool air. To be honest, if possible, I really want to return this item.",4
"Just received this unit.. big & heavy, but it sure does cool nicely! I am using it in a small bedroom and it can make the room chilly in a matter of minutes.CONS:- Air conditioning mode requires the fan running 24 hours a day. Doesn't matter if the A/C is only active 1 hour a day. You can't turn the fan off. I was hoping for something like a hotel air conditioning unit. Kicks in & makes noise while cooling (a small price to pay) but then remains silent the rest of the time. I realize this increases efficiency (circulating air in the room) but I wish it was an optional feature. If you want A/C, even in standby, expect to have the fan blowing all the time.- No Canadian warranty. The instructions say the warranty is only for the continental 48 United States.PROS:- Wow, this thing cools fast. I've tried it in single host (2nd hose optional) and 2-hose configurations, and it works fantastic.- Compressor is pretty darn quiet. I've owned my share of A/C units and can tell you that this is a refined product. Good quality. Someone totally new to A/C might not realize this, but compared to other options. this unit has decent sound control.- 2 hose unit. It is more efficient to use 2 hoses (prevents less warm air being sucked into the home, and therefore better cooling) but it's not required. If you just want one hose going outside, this unit will still work just fine.",4
"The product is great, so far. I have bought this same c unit and it ran for 3 yrs no problems. I havnt had this one long enough to know the longevity but it puts out good air flow.Thos is the 2nd order due to the first arrive very poorly packed and was broken, but that could have been UPS and not the company packing. No problems with shipping on the 2nd delivery. Thumbs up!!",4
"This item cools very well. However, the instructions report that the collars are attached upon delivery. They are not. I am a novice and I found it very hard to get both collars on. I had to use duct tape to get them to stay. The instructions also said that foam insulation was included. Not so. I used materials that I had at home to try to complete a tight fit, and duct tape of course.Other manufactures provide the insulated stripping so the fit is as tight as possible.I purchased Honeywell because it is an American product. I was disappointed that other manufactures made installation much more complete and easy. Thanks Rita",4
"This unit BLASTS cold air for a great distance. With the louvers set to “swing”—my whole living room gets cool very quickly. In fact—I had to turn it off a couple of times—and sit shivering under a blanket!I was also impressed at how quiet it is. I’ve only run it on the highest setting so far—and it’s right next to where I sit to watch TV. It doesn’t bother me at all.The remote control, and the WiFi connection to the app, were super easy to set up.The only problem (and it’s a BIG one) is the window installation kit. It only extends to 68.5 inches. My sliding glass door is 91 inches tall. Even using TWO complete sets of kits didn’t help. For one thing—all of the included panels don’t universally ‘mate’ to each other. As a result I had to use 2 panels with the opening for attaching the hose—and then mount another full panel behind the upper one, to cover the hole.The photo—taken after some of the upper panels came crashing down—shows how it buckles, and pulls the hose out of its panel, leaving enormous air gaps. Waiting for my favourite contractor to return from vacation to fix this mess!I ended up with a leaning tower of panels—with gaps you can put your fist through. Within a day—the various joints began to buckle—and the top 1/4 came crashing down.I think the window installation kit would work perfectly with the average hung or sliding window—making this unit an excellent choice.However, if you have to install in a sliding door—be prepared to construct a custom window kit, using wood.",4
"I have set up my airconditioner with the help of a friend. I was concerned that the item delivered was sent with the venting adapter for a hung window. That was a lot of plastic. And my window is a casement window. Fortunately a friend was able to use the adapter sent to me. Where I live, most apartments in any buildings built from the 1970s on tend to have casement rather than hung windows. It would be helpful to be able to opt out of receiving, and paying for, a vent adapter one can't use.I have given this a/c a test run. It is still too cool where I am to be using it for any length of time, so I can't give you an account of how satisfied I am with this purchase.",4
I bought this for a studio so the area is much smaller than what it's designed for but I have no seperate rooms to seal up. Bought it with the intention of keeping it for a few years when I'll hopefully move to a bigger place.Unit has definitely been getting louder as time passes and I honestly feel like the filter isn't going to be enough to keep it maintained long term. Will definitely need to be opened up and cleaned out after a year or two.Works super well though and relatively easy to set up.Be careful with the ventilation hose/pipe. Easy to split the corners of it when extending to the window but I'm planning on insulating it anyway so not a deal breaker for me.App won't work with it on 5ghz wifi so make sure you have dual band or 2.5ghz if that's a dealbreaker for you. Personally I'll be buying a new router as my Shaw one doesn't work with most smart devices.Definitely recommend the AC unit.,4
vents could be better designed. should be adjustable but i made a deflector to direct air upward.BUT it really gets cold.noise level isnt really loud about same as hotel room unit. BUT had intermittent vibration issues which is really annoying at night. turned out to be copper piping from compressor which i fixed by pushing a tube just a bit and isolating vibe with a large rubber o ring attached to another pipe to another part of the unit to keep it taught,4
"Okay...this is the first portable A/C unit I've owned. I held off purchasing one for quite a while as I couldn't figure out how to set one up with the window that I have (tall, swings out at bottom). But after finding a window seal that is set up for windows that swing out at the side, and adapting that, I was able to set up this A/C unit. I placed it in my bedroom (approx. 11x12) and have to say that the difference in temperature was almost immediate as soon as I turned it on. I live in a city that can get very hot and humid in the summertime (Ottawa, Canada...high temps can be upward of 40deg Celsius), and I have a dog who doesn't tolerate heat very well, so - after a failed attempt with a swamp cooler (does not work in high humidity areas) - decided to put my money on the De'longhi. And so far, no regrets.I love the remote that comes with this unit. I love that the air conditioner takes almost no time to cool down an 11x12 room. I love that it isn't that much of a space hog (a bit, but to be expected with portables). And I love that it has a noise dampening option. Personally, my hearing sucks. I wear hearing aids, and when I take them out at night to sleep, a bomb wouldn't wake me, so noise isn't an issue there. But in the evenings where I decide to run the A/C in my living room (vertical slider in that room, the window kit that comes with the A/C works perfectly in the window) the A/C needs to be quieter so I can hear the tv. On 'whisper' mode, it's perfect. Yes, the A/C still makes some noise, but not enough to interfere. I also love the fact that it doesn't require emptying of a water reservoir. Well, so far none....but even if it did need to be done once or twice during a summer season, thatThe only con that I have so far with this unit is that, while it is portable, it is very heavy and makes it rather difficult to move from room to room, esp. if thick carpeting is involved. However, this is such a minor annoyance that it's hardly worth mentioning.Time will tell if this A/C stands up to long-term use...so far I've used it 7 or 8 times - but for now, I'm really pleased, and really glad that I bought it.*Update: Within the first few months of using this A/C unit I noticed that it was very wobbly whenever I had to move it from one room to another, and it started to get lopsided. It took me a while to figure out, but finally did...one of the wheels was damaged and completely missing after moving it. To me this is a 'this shouldn't happen with ordinary use'; however, I have had the A/C for two years now, and despite this one 'shouldn't have happened' defect, the A/C itself is still working fine. (My workaround, I put a book under the defective side.)It's very rare that I need to actually remove water from it, and I live in a very high-humidity area (Ottawa, Canada). Compare this to a Costway A/C that I purchased earlier this year (so I would no longer need to move the A/C from room to room): the Costway unit was used 3 times, and on the third morning I woke up to the carpet in my bedroom absolutely, completely soaked with water (and my hardwood floors underneath probably damaged).I still back up the De'Longhi A/C in terms of functionality, and would recommend it.",4
"Works as an effective fan, but in order to get the most out of the cooler you need to use cold water. Like actually cold water. Ice would be useful too but the fill port is very small and will not fit standard sized ice cubes. I refrigerate a gallon of water and then use that to fill the unit. Even when not filling with water and just using the fan feature, this effectively blows air and does a decent job of cooling the room.I have been looking for an air cooler for some time and most are super cheap and un-trustworthy. This one works well, but it does come at a price.",4
"Note this is an air cooler, not an air conditioner. I bought this to put in a small, windowless bedroom where I can’t vent out a portable air conditioner. Works great to cool the room. Knocked off a star as I wish the water intake were a bit bigger so that it would be easier to fill without spilling everywhere and that I could put ice in it.",4
"This is alright, I bought this because I live in an apartment. I get dry heat in the winter no matter if I like it or not, and the humidity is less than 10% in my place. I bought this to help prevent me from opening windows when the outside Temperature is -20 F. In the summer with 60% humidity.. it doesn't cool.. just makes it more humid. This is not an air conditioner and wasn't intended to be. The basic features appear to work fine. I'll know more come winter",4
This air cooler does cool the air in the room. I used a fan also to circulate the cool air. It does need to be filled with water a couple of times a day and the back filter needs to be cleaned every couple of days.,4
"I purchase this to air condition our camper and the installation was simple. This unit is high quality build and quite. It runs really efficiently, and reaches set temperature quickly. I have not needed to use the dehumification mode yet, so can't comment on the installation of the drainage for that type of setup. I would have given it 5 stars; but the exhaust vent tube on the back side is quite large, and you need quite a bit of space behind the unit, and in a camper that could be a little lacking. However, if you placed this in a cabin or small room of home, it would be fine. I would highly recommend this AC Unit.",4
"We've been in a hot dry (translate: drought!) situation for over two months and I deemed an evaporative cooler to be best for the situation (my brother calls them ""swamp coolers""). I'm glad I chose Honeywell; they have a respected name to uphold and this product is no exception. It cools quite well, even when it's over 30 celsius, especially when I add ice to the top compartment.. And it offers a choice of useful settings. It's a little hard to fill; and I don't look forward to draining it when the season's done. Guess I'll let it run as dry as it can and get my younger, stronger brother to lift it into the the tub to drain. Those are the only reasons for the reduction from 5 stars.",4
"This works great, but it is LOUD. It also made my electric bill jump up quite a bit. I'm glad to have it, but I'll be limiting how much I use it.",4
"A bit noisy, but doable, and keeps my bedroom at a comfortable, consistent temperature. The window kit fits a window higher than 36"",my window is 39"" and the window insert extended just fine. Haven't had a power bill yet, so don't know about it's energy efficiency. I can care less about the remote!",4
"It met our expectation during the past Summer 2021 Heat Wave in British Columbia. Easily cooled off our 400 sq. ft. main bedroom. Furthermore, it also worked well in our 800 sq. ft. 2nd level room of our townhouse unit.The only flaw of this product is the window kit. It is short when putting it vertically and we still need to buy an extra window kit just to fill the window gap.The price is also a bit high that we paid as much as $1400. The price is doubled compared to other online stores like Wayfair.",4
"For starters, if you're looking for something to cool an entire room, this is NOT the purchase to make!! That being said though, this is perfect if you need something to set up near you while sitting at a desk or something local like that. The air isn't freezing by any means, but it's definitely cool air and feels nice. It's pretty energy efficient, easy to use, and the noise isn't bad! It can get a bit loud on the 4th (highest) setting, but it's not an annoying sound in my opinion. I do wish there was a line to show the max level the water can be because when I first got it I did make the mistake of overfilling it, so make sure you turn on the light to make it easy to see the water level as you're filling it up. Otherwise, I have no real complaints about it! As long as you're realistic in understanding that it's for cooling a localized area rather than an entire room (unless that room is very small,) it works great for what it's meant to do and I'd say is worth the purchase now that I'm entering my second summer of using it!",4
"Third try is the charm. All of these stupid ads about blast chill tech is just smoke and mirrors. All these things are just fans with mist ie Evaporitive Coolers. What you want is fan power and mist power and 90% of them are crap in both categories.This one delivers with great mist and great fan power. In addition it's water tank is much larger than most. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is the fan blows upward and there isn't a way to direct the flow. So on a night stand it goes over your head. I put something under the back edge to solve the problem.This is the third one I tried and is the only one worth getting. The other little box ones, or the ones with special hexagon lattice inside, and the one which shows you a refrigerator coil which it doesn't actually have are garbage. They don't put out enough air flow or mist to do anything. Get this one!!",4
Air conditioner is pretty good but very expensive for the amount of room that It can cool down it works very well however it only works in a small space. It is a nightmare to install because the piece that goes in the window does not fit a normal window it is either too small or too big the part that you use to adjust it to the window only adjusts into a window over the normal size and if you take that adjustment piece off and then it is too small to fit in the window.,4
I'm realy pleased with this unit. It wasn't cheap but you get what you pay for. Its heavy and awkward to transport & unbox but super easy to set up with no assembly other than than the window exhaust installation. It worked well right from the first push of yhe on button. I haven't tried the phone e- connection so I can't comment on that. But it nicely cools my large living/dining/hall in 80-90F weather. I also like the fan only air filter option. Its a bit noisy on high fan but not annoyingly so. The remote is a nice extra.,4
"Yes it works great for a bedroom. Yes installation was a breeze. No it's not quiet at all.Good luck sleeping with this on, It's about as quiet as the food court at a mall on a Saturday. (Slight exaggeration but you get the point). Maybe its just because I like to sleep in silence.It would be nice if it would turn off the blower once the room temp has been reached but I have yet to have that happen. ""Night Mode"" just locks the settings. One thing to note, you may want to insulate the exhaust hose with a blanket (preferably wool for fire resistance) as the hose gets quite warm. The drain tank is not removable, it drains through a little valve at the bottom. They do include a silicone hose to drain the water which is nice.I ordered this one because my AC went out and this was cheap and had 2 day shipping. Not to mention my window is mostly blocked by a desk so this style works great.Overall not a terrible AC unit, just not for noise sensitive people.",4
"Good air flow, strong breeze, very cools with ice blocks. Well worth the money",4
Electric cord is to short.,4
Worked really well,4
"Update 11/6/2024Guess I've had my first failure after a year. The 3 speed switch or resistor no longer functions properly. No low or medium speed, but high still works at least.Know what you're getting with an evaporative cooling fan.It's not an air conditioning unit and there's only so much it can do, especially in an already humid environment.I do like the fan, there's other similar fans on the market for lower cost, but this one is green and it matches my toolboxes lol.This is packaged very poorly with only a thin cardboard box and it came a bit beaten up from shipping.Nothing major though, just some dings in the plastic, still works fine and does not leak.I'm a heavy equipment mechanic in East Texas, so there's an absurd amount of dust in our shop, extreme heat, and high humidity majority of the time.It does cool down the temperature a few degrees on the drier days, others it just makes everything feel more wet.I've only had it for a few months so far, but it's holding up well despite the dusty environment.Strong fan for the size, it will blow itself backwards unless the wheels are locked or it has water inside.",4
Hoping they both work after the looong winters here.,4
"Like the fact it does cool the living room down. It I'd definitely not quiet. It's loud. Iis a bit of idiosyncratic which means you'll be emptying the two tiny (and I mean tiny) water traps a couple of times a day and they are placed in a way that makes no sense making it annoying as heck but it does have a good fan on it. And does cool pretty good. I would suggest 3 placed about a 3br ranch style home to stay pleasantly cool all thru the home. Maybe buy some plastic tubing for continuous draining to empty into a flat, lipped container to empty at your convenience. Drains about a cup total, a day",4
"I haven't used the unit much, but it seems to work fine and was easy to set up. It cools nicely and I am happy with my purchase.",4
"The media could not be loaded. Pros: Arrived quick and packaged well. Very easy set up, though I suppose that depends on your window. It def heats your space up, and fairly quickly- which is excellent. It is a reasonable volume for what it’s doing. Used for AC for a short period, same- it cooled space well. Looks decent and exactly as pictured.Cons: the biggest negative is how the heat setting produces TONS of water in the machine that requires draining, and the drain hole is at the very bottom. A hose is provided that is useless, because you cannot create a suction, and therefore you cannot use a bucket. So, unless you elevate your machine on blocks, you only have about a half inch to work with. Ironically the water space in the machine must go below the drainage hole because you have to pick up and slightly tilt the machine to FULLY empty it. I used an old baking tray to allow continuous drainage, which looks terrible, but if the height is above the hole, then it will not drain and the machine will shut off. Like literally, if the water catching bin is the slightest bit higher than the hole the hose isn’t working, lol. The amount of water does decrease some as the machine runs, but not enough to ignore the design flaw.There is also some leakage from the exhaust tube. With AC the exhaust is hot air. With Heat running the exhaust is cold air. I recommend taping the connection points where exhaust is to reduce air escape/blow back.Unknown: I can’t comment on the price but I am certain it will be less than my electric baseboard several decades old. Saving $$ is also why I got this machine and getting it on sale def seems worth it if my monthly bill goes down significantly. The house is loads warmer too.4 stars because it works as described and looks decent. 1 star off because of the drainage being a big PITA.",4
"By ""med - large room"" I mean the difference between a reg bedroom or a living room/dining area together. I filled the tank, set it on 3 (out of 4) and the entire living room/dining area was cooled off withing 1-2 hours and I live on the sunny side of a building. It gets really hot here. I then turned it down to a 2 and that's where it 's been for a week. The ice packs didn't do much. They take up room for needed water. I put 2 - 64oz bottles of water in the fridge and pour one in the tank when it gets below half a tank. You can easily see the water level on the front. If it cools off at night, you can turn off the water pump to save water but it still evaporates over time. I like the moist air at night for my sinuses.It's not silent but it's pretty quiet. A definite positive.I really like this fan but here's 1-2 bad things.The display on top turns off (lights go off) so at night I can't see what settings it's on until you press buttons on the remote or the fan itself. If it had a motion sensor on top to light up when it detects your hand, that would be great.As stated, the ice packs didn't make much difference if you're putting cold water in there regularly. They took room away for more water.Only one issue from a handicapped/wheelchair POV: The release for the tank on the back is all the way at the bottom near the base. It's hard for me to bend that low to open the back tank but it opens easily and closes/secures easily. It's also an issue for me to see the top of the fan controls easily. For someone standing over it, it's perfect. For someone who's eyes are basically level with the top, it's a little difficult but not too bad. Just a LITTLE annoying.I still recommend it. It's the best fan I've bought in years and is pretty quiet.",4
"Bought this to keep me comfortable on the front porch during the Florida summers while I make Internet's and smoke cigars; it worked almost as well as I hoped.The bad: I wish it got a bit cooler. It does a nice job and for the most part does what I hoped. There were a couple days that a few degrees cooler would have made the difference but it still.did a great job as I would have been too uncomfortable to sit out for a few hours.The good: it blows a large amount of cool, dry, air that is very directional - a foot in either direction and you will loose the bubble of comfort. The condensation reservoir is substantial and generally will allow me to run it for 3 or so hours - in Florida humidity - before needing to be emptied. The wheels make it easy to move around; it is a bit heavy to lift but not unmanageable. I often make phone calls and conference calls while on patio and the unit is not so noisy to be noticeable or hamper patio conversion.If you are looking to solve a similar problem, this unit works very well.",4
The media could not be loaded. It's EXPENSIVE for what it is. No reason this should be over $500 (probably $300-$400) so at $744 it's high.I'm planning on using it camping. I'm sure it will work great for night time cooling. It's heavy but sort of compact. It's ok to leave in the rain they say so to me that's important for my use scenario. I'll be running it outside my tent and simply piping the cool are outlet hose it.I'm going to add an extension hose to the outlet and possibly the drain. I'll update my review when I have finished those projects.,4
"I bought this this help my outdoor dog through the scorching summers in the west. It absolutely works, and is quiet as a mouse. It puts out hot air from the exhaust side, so I don’t know how it would be in a garage, but it really only cools the spot in front of the duct anyway. 111 degrees yesterday, and my dog was cool as a cucumber in the shade with nice cool air blowing on him.",4
It is a good product.,4
"I have the cooler located in a well covered and shaded outside area for my outside pets here in the Southwest. Had to replace cooler pump at two months (June - July) of daily 14 hour use. If used a lot, or use is of any importance, I recommend keeping a new spare cooler pump on hand. Shopping around will show that replacement cooler pumps are readily available, ranging from $18 to $43. Cooler pump replacement is fairly easy with videos available online. I will have this cooler going 14 hours a day thru August, possibly September.The overall size is convenient and will fit just about anywhere. For me, supplying water via the hose attachment is an absolute necessity, but the float valve only allows the water level to rise just high enough to completely cover the cooler pump, about 1/4 of the tanks capacity. The existing float is fixed, but adjustable floats are available from Hessaire.I am disappointed in the plastic used for the housing as it seems to be brittle, so I am very careful with it. I never pick the cooler up by the provided handle if there is water in the cooler as I am not convinced the housing could take it.For the money, I think it does a pretty good job. I think I might have been happier paying a little more for a more durable, higher end, higher output model, since it is only used in extreme outside conditions (108F to 118F).",4
"I took a lot of this review from other Amazonian because I agree with all of it and it is worth repeating.""I did a ton of research trying to figure out if I even wanted a portable AC. I needed it for a room with west facing windows that gets blasted with direct sunlight the entire afternoon/early evening. Window units became very inefficient during really hot days and thought a portable solution would help. And it definitely has! But.... you need to know certain things in order to get the most out of this.Firstly, any review that mentions you don't need to worry about attaching a hose to drain excess water that builds up is 100% wrong. You MUST attach a hose for this for it to work properly. It'll turn on and work fine for short period of time until the water reservoir inside this fills up and causes it to shut off. If you're on the east coast with humid summers, this will fill up with water and will need to drain out in roughly 10-15 minutes after turning it on. I got lucky and just happened to have a hose from an old kitchen sink sprayer. It fit in there perfectly. The small holes on the plastic attachment that the exhaust hose attaches to that goes in your window can easily be widened using a scissor and slowly spinning/burrowing it to grind the hole big enough for the hose. Got my drainage hose through that hole and under the screen of my window to drain outside. Works perfectly.Secondly, the exhaust hose leaks out a bunch of heat from the hot air if fully expanded. If your plan is to get one of these and the exhaust hose just barely reaches the window there will be a noticeable amount of heat given off. The closer to the window the better and if you can find a safe way to prop it up off the ground so it's closer to the height of the window, I highly recommend that and it'll also make it easier to run the drain hose outside. I have mine setup to where the exhaust hose is barely expanded, which makes it thicker and allows less heat to escape, where the AC unit is roughly 15-20 inches from the window. I have these old wooden speaker stands I made that can easily support this AC unit and keeps it about 2 feet off the ground so the exhaust attachment on the back of the unit is even with the plastic attachment for the window. Ideally you want as straight of a line to the outside as possible for that hot exhaust air. And once you have the plastic attachment for the window installed, you'll wanna seal up any open cracks in between with tape.Last thing is using the Dehumidifier mode over regular AC mode. Mine didn't come with a manual so not sure if they both do the same thing but I always leave mine in Dehumidifier mode and works great that way. It blows out the same cold air and sucks all the moisture out of the air. Which if you live on the east coast, TRUST ME... You definitely want that. It's 94 degrees and miserable out today in Philadelphia and I'm perfectly comfortable. Look outside the window and the hose is just a continuous, fast drip. All that humidity ends up outside and makes it easier to keep the room comfortable. When I switch it to regular AC mode it doesn't seem as comfortable even though it blows out the same cold air. Not sure if it's just where I live and this room being on a 2nd floor but this works well for me in dehumidifier mode.Overall I'm happy with my purchase and this unit works well. It's a bit more noisy than I had hoped but all portable units are noisier than window units. It only makes sense when the whole thing being inside your room vs. most of it outside your window where sound will disperse away from your house. I see a lot of comments about how loud portable units are when these people don't seem to realize they're all like that. Even fancy, more expensive units will still be rather noisy. It's just how loud the fan is. So, beware of reviews by people who have limited knowledge on this sort of thing and just post their own narrowminded review of something like a portable AC unit, not understanding how it really works and what needs to happen to get the most out of one.",4
"I like the cooling of the Apex 700. It's also much quieter than my old evaporative cooler. I also like the fact that the intake and cooling vent are both on the front - which means it can be put in a corner without worrying about airflow. The hose intake is also on the back of the unit and out of the way.The unit is WiFi/app controllable, and can send status notifications to your phone. It was giving me some erroneous complaints about potential for overfilling for a few days, but those have gone away.The issue I've had with it - and almost sent it back over - is that it was leaking a significant amount of water. When I diagnosed the problem, I found that the cover for the evaporative media touches the media. When water gets to the front of the media, it wicks on over to that cover, then the path of least resistance for that water is to channel out of the unit and down onto the ground (or in my case, my patio's concrete slab).I don't know why the designers thought it was a good idea to have that front cover touch the cooling media that can have water on it, and not provide a path of least resistance for the water to wick back down into the unit rather than out onto the ground.Removing the cover over the evaporative media fixes the problem, but I think it would also work to space the cover out so it doesn't touch the media, cut the cover back, or add some kind of lip that extends down from the bottom of the grille that would wick the water down that way and back into the reservoir rather than out and onto the ground.",4
"Overall thank God for portable air conditioner. I live on the top floor and gets very hot in the summer. To make matters worse the bedroom window gets direct west facing sun all day. The portable air conditioner is BEAUTIFUL. The size, works well to move around and draws all the heat out in a matter of minutes, 9.5/10. Noise level is a little loud at first until you get use to it.",4
I will recommend this to anyone,4
effective,4
"Tired of super high prices for electricity these days and I live in South Louisiana where costs are pretty cheap. I wanted a stand alone AC unit for my bedroom so I don't have run the central AC for just me at night. Researched a bunch of these units and though I was skeptical of the price of this one, I took a chance. Here is my review:The GOOD: Very much like the standalone component of this AC unit. I wanted something portable that I could move around the house if the power goes out. This unit has WiFi and Alexa integration. About the only thing I have found useful about that is being able to turn it on and off with the Alexa. Outside of that, have not found any use for that integration. The unit cools very well for my bedroom which is a few hundred sq/ft. and the ambient noise is about the same as being in a hotel room and running the AC in always on mode. For me, not a problem. Additionally, I haven't really had to drain the internal condensate bucket and I run it every night. My room does not usually get more than 50% humidity so it does not produce a bunch of condensate. Even in the RV, didn't drain more than about couple of mL of water. The customer service was very good for the product too, when I needed it for the issue mentioned below.The NOT AS GOOD (but not terrible)1. Though the unit cools well for my bedroom, when I used it in a 31ft RV, along with the onboard AC in the RV, between the two of them they could only get the temp down to about 75* on a 95* day. At night it worked splendidly.2. The Alexa integration appears to be very limited. Other than turning on and off, I have not found any other useful features. Maybe I need to research further.3. After about 2 weeks of running all night every night, a new phenomenon cropped up. Once the unit gets the room down to set temperature, the compressor would cycle off as you would expect. The fan would stay running and then compressor would cycle back on as needed. Well after 2 weeks, I was awoken in the middle of the night by the silence, that you would expect when the power goes out. The unit went completely silent like it was turned off, but it was still on. Adjusting temperature kicked the unit back on and then randomly it would go silent again. After dealing with customer support for about a week and a half, it was determined that the unit is functioning as intended. The unit will turn the fans off if the room temp stays at the set level long enough. This may be ok for some but I like the ambient noise of the fans running. The issue is, you cannot set it to have a persistent fan unless you put it in ""Fan Only"" mode. I hope this is a feature that the manufacturer ends up programming into the unit. The ability to have persistent fan in AC mode.4. The expandable exhaust hose is versatile for moving the unit around but it does not contain the heat of the exhaust very well. The exhaust hose gets pretty warm and that ends up adding some heat around the unit. Its not a tremendous amount but I would expect an AC unit to contain the heat from the condenser a little better.Overall I am very happy with the unit for what I needed it for and the price. I would have thought a 10,000BTU unit would cool a little more efficiently but its fine. Also, I REALLY hope they put a persistent fan setting in the AC mode to keep the ambient noise and circulation of air going all night.",4
"This is my second Whynter Portable A/C unit. I find the brand comes highly recommended and my first unit has served me well in my living room for several years. I purchased the Whynter ARC-148MS 14,000 BTU Portable Air Conditioner for my home office after our record-setting heat wave in June. My home office is only 120 square feet and, by rights, I should be using a window-mounted unit, but I did not feel comfortable installing a window unit by myself in a second-story window, so I went with a portable unit. With that caveat, here are my impressions.COOLING. This Whynter works very well cooling my small space. It has a ""swing"" feature which raises and lowers the vent cover to provide an oscillating effect, which is nice.NOISE. Portable air conditioners are noisy, doesn't matter the brand or model. You are in the room with the unit, unlike a window-mounted unit where the noisy parts are outside. Because the room I am using this unit in is so small, only 120 sq ft., the noise is inescapable. If you want a quiet air conditioner, get a window-mounted unit. Running it on fan mode is a little quieter than in cooling mode, but I still feel the need to turn it off when I am on a call or online meeting.SETTING UP. Setting up the Whynter was very easy. This is a SINGLE-HOSE unit, which makes set-up a bit easier than a dual-hose unit. For performance, I actually prefer a dual-hose unit. The Whynter has casters so you can easily move it when needed. Follow the instructions, leaving your unit off for several hours after you first install it to assure best performance.PRICE. Portable A/C units tend to be more expensive than window A/C units. Given that I was unable to work in my home office this summer without A/C, the cost was worth it to me.OVERALL. I am pleased with this Whynter A/C unit. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the noise, but really, that is going to be an issue with any portable air conditioner. Whynter is my ""go-to"" brand for portable air conditioners.",4
It seems like when I put ice inside the tray it just doesn’t throw enough cold air it doesn’t matter how much ice i put in it.,4
"The media could not be loaded. I have older windows which window units wouldn’t work in. I found this floor unit and compared to other brands it was significantly less. I was apprehensive since I’ve never heard of Shinco. This little unit is great, definitely gets my room cold. I would give it 5 stars but it’s a bit noisy (can’t hear my tv since I have the unit right by my head, stupid window placement.) It’s worth the money for sure. I couldn’t use the plastic piece that the hose fits into on my window because it was too big, as a temporary fix I just popped it through the window screen and crack open my window when I use it.",4
"Now that I've had time to try different things with it I'm pretty happy with how well it cools. The instruction book left a lot to trial and error. Remote came with a battery but did not work so I can't evaluate that. The so called ""upper tank"" appears to be a way to fill the actual lower tank. No word in the instructions about the drain plug being left open or closed in the ""upper tank"" it appeared that to fill the lower tank you pull the plug and pour the water in the top then reinsert the plug for operation. Instructions say ""ice box"" can be removed from the unit and be put in freezer. I'm guessing this means one of the blue bottles that comes with it can be frozen and put in the top to aid in cooling. The instructions say doors and windows must be left open to operate. Pretty sure that would defeat the chance of cooling my house when it's 106 degrees outside. The louvers must be pried open with a fingernail or ? and positioned. After a lot of guessing I'm pretty pleased with it now.",4
"I have a West facing study room that the sun beats down strongly every afternoon during the summer months which the central air con cannot cope. The ideal solution should be a portable air con but condominium rules forbid the replacement of the window frames nor the sticking out of the exhaust chute from such a unit. This cooler is the next best choice. Whilst not as effective as an air conditioner, I measure the temperature dropping about 5°C when unit is running.However, it requires daily maintenance like emptying and filling of the water tank and the replacement of the ice packs every 3 hours. And these should be the bigger ones used in food coolers and not the toy like tubes that comes with it. If you are lazy and does not want to spend extra on some ""real"" cooler packs, this may not be for you.",4
"I purchased two costway coolers. I use them in a 20 by 20 room. It keep the room at least 10 degrees cooler than the rest of the house. I ran them most day on 80 to 90 days how ever those days over 90 you could really feel the moisture/humidity that these machines put out.Also there were a few review where people said they had odor off of their units. Since I had two I pulled one out and let it acclimate for a week or two before use, No odor at all. The second one I pulled out and let it sit for a few hours it had a small faint odor that was present first use but than was gone. We will see how it goes next season when I pull these back out. I suspect that the bad oder are from rancid water not able to escape the machine. I can't say yet.",4
It doesn’t stay on longer than 2 minutes. Poor quality.Update: the company has reached out to me to help resolve the problem. Ended up getting a refund. I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly they responded and willing to help find a solution. They offered to replace but I declined since I no longer needed the item. I would definitely give the company another chance in the future. Product was a 1 star for me but because they tried to make it right I rate it 4 stars,4
"Cools very well with awesome air flow! You can feel it from up to 25 feet away when on high. Worked great here in the central valley of California up till the temps go over 102°, then efficiency drops considerably. But it's an evaporative cooler and they all do at those temps. This unit is very light and easy to move around on hard dirt if empty of water, and if full of water on concrete. It is not loud if on low, but on high you have to raise your voice if you are within 10 feet of it. My only real gripe is the motor rusted after only one cooling season and now is locked up after only 2 cooling seasons. If the additional 4 year warranty covers the motor then it would be well worth the extra money because the replacement motor costs more than the warranty does. Did not expect this to rust so fast being a motor supposedly designed for a damp environment, I expected the metal to be more rust resistant and was surprised that it was an open housing motor (you can see the windings) and not sealed. It is obviously not a motor designed for wet / damp environment. My other recommendation is to take a drill bit the same size as the original holes where the water drips from the top channel onto the pads and redrill / ream them out then blow out with compressed air. The manufacturing process of drilling out these holes seems to leave lots of plastic remnants which slow down or block entirely the steady stream of water. Removal of the top cover during this process will ensure that all plastic shavings are removed and can not continue to clog the holes. Other than that, it worked great, while it worked. Overall, I think it is overpriced for the quality. One could purchase a residential side draft swamp cooler for 800 dollars and with a few modifications (garden hose connection for water fill valve, caster wheels), would have a better quality product that's going to last much longer, albeit much heavier and not as portable!",4
"Update 2; received a replacement unit and this one is working fine. I suspect the original unit was damaged during shipping. The new unit is quieter than the original and the noise level now is ok; louder than a fan of course but it's not so loud you can't sleep with it on. Overall works fine now. When buying one of these I would suggest you make sure to test it out right away and run it a few times to make sure it wasn't damaged during shipping.Update: after speaking with the seller the offered to send a replacement. Will update this after I receive the new unitAbsolute piece of junk junk. Only actually ran for somewhere around 12-15 hours,. The cooling output was alright, but the noise level was absurd. And then things got bad. At this point it started making an extremely loud whistling sound - picture the most annoying teapot imaginable. This was multiple times louder than than just the standard running noise, which was too loud to begin with. Even after turning it off the whistling continued for another 30 to 45 minutes and could be heard two rooms away. After that the compressor stopped working, which mean no more cooling. So now it's a $300 fan, and not even a good one at that. Don't waste your time or money on this.",4
"So 3 months into owning this unit it’s finally hot enough outside to set it up. IT WORKS! Good thing since I’m out of my return window.Background: Moved into my first home with Central Air, works great downstairs, not so good upstairs. We lack a return up here, it is a retrofit gravity system. I needed a solution to not melt myself and my wife in a relatively small room with 2 robust gaming PCs and too many monitors.Pros:Air out the top is nice and coldRemote is easy to useSetup was about 10 minutesFan blows strong and the cooling vent has a nice oscillationCons:Pretty darn loud (All portable AC’s are since the compressor is inside the room)Exhaust tube is Very Hot, which is to be expected if you have any idea how an ac works.After about 30 minutes the computer room (upstairs, old house, 11x15’, newer windows) is still pretty warm, but it is getting better.(1 hr- still not Cold, yet better. Although there is no gaming going on so that will be the true test. I will update if this LG fails that test)Hindsight being 20/20, just shoving a window ac in would have definitely cooled the space faster and not introduced extra heat into the room (exhaust tube), while also being a bit quieter.BUT - Being relatively portable and not having to screw anything into my window/frame is very convenient. I can see myself keeping this unit and not giving it away like I have 7-8 window ac units before. Also hindsight, should have kept one…Tip: Keep the vent as short and straight as possible.Unit has a dehumidifier mode, you Must attach a hose to the upper drain.No hose/drain required dying AC mode, the unit has an evap system. It will however warn you if you need to drain it.I’d call it a safe buy, reputable brand, fair price per BTU. I think I’ll get some kind of insulation for the vent.",4
The media could not be loaded. It work well nice design but very expensive I found the same thing in the store for the third of the price around $550 they sold it to me on Amazon at $1500 so I would tell you to shop around go to different stores it’s much cheaper screwed big time,4
"Great product, received on time as promised. Cool down my 100 sq. ft office quickly, still testing out in my 1st month of operation. However, one down side...noice level is loud despite rating @51 db for quietness.",4
"It is easy to install, it works, but still a bit too noisy for my liking. But for a portable AC, I guess it is as good as it gets. The price point is expensive.",4
The unit works great after the first week... the only downside so far is the REPEATED CLICKING sound when in heat mode... the unit will click Loudly (like an electrical circuit switching on and off) as many as 5 times... this action repeats several times (at least 10) over the course of a night... it is loud enough to wake you up from over 20 feet away... Note: The cause of the clicking is explained in the user manual... The unit does heat and cool well... and does not click in cool mode.,4
"It’s does exactly what it says. Not too bad for heating. For cooling, it cycles cool water to expel a cool air flow from vent. BUT don’t expect to get cool like a HVAC can if your need to cool a space (semi insulated) during a heatwave. What I find that works for me is using gallon of water from fridge to pour into bucket and cycle several ice bricks (2 at a time) every couple of hours to get small space to a consistent, tolerable temperature if you’re gonna be in the space for several hours.",4
"I bought this unit because of it’s ability to add ice packs.The hose connector was missing a piece to connect to a garden hose. However, this company stands by their product because they immediately let me know that my order must have been missing this piece and immediately shipped it to me.Despite this, the swamp cooler works great, and it gets a two thumbs up from my wife, who prior to the arrival of the cooler, refused to sit on the patio when temps went into the 90’s. Operating on high, (which is very very quiet) temperatures in the low 90’s (93 to be exact) dropped to a very comfortable 84 in Central Texas Hill Country heat. The oscillating fan cools the entire 22’ x15’ patio, and evenings outdoors are now quite enjoyable. The ice packs add to the cooling effect. Definitely would buy this one again.",4
It works great. We have a tiny house it's 250sf and it does the job keeps it cool. But we only use it in the afternoon when we are home. We use a window AC during the day. It blows out hard cold air in the afternoon Florida heat at the right time,4
Bought this unit before any reviews were posted so obviously took a chance. Luckily it worked out for me as it is blowing cold air nicely. Knocked off 1 star as the window kit was not long enough to cover the height of my window (though I knew this from the product description). I had to buy a separate window kit.,4
"The first unit I got was defective, so I returned and got this one.On ""Strong"" mode, it's full fans and cooling. In a hot room, you need to be in front of the unit to feel the cool air. It's a good spot cooler, and that's about it.I may buy another one of these for power outages, short camping trips. But mainly, it's used at home for spot cooling in a hot room.I let it run for a few hours on full blast. It burned a stead 193 watts. Not bad for emergency/spot cooling. Just know what to expect. Not a strong fan, so you have to be close. It's only half the cooling capacity of the smallest window units.In a computer room, it's great when the PC starts heating up.Try it out! Expensive though.",4
I have been looking for some time and tried the available units in store. This unit is the best I found having consideration for price and efficiency. That is to say it is affordable and does make a difference. I live in QLD Australia and the humidity is a real problem. An 'evaporative cooler' is not an effective air cooler in humid conditions. This unit is an 'Air Conditioner' and does cool the air and remove humidity. I was impressed with the amount of water it removed from the air. I use it in a slide on (truck) camper. A small space and it works. This thing is not small but is comparable with the other units on the market and is lighter which is an important consideration weight is critical. this is the pick of the market at this price.,4
"My only dislike is the exhaust system. The hose fitting is loose on the section it attaches to the back of the air conditioner. Moving the air conditioner will sometimes make it come un-attached. I mainly use the cold air so the heat it produces needs to go out of the window. The exhaust hose adjusts in length but the insulated cover that wraps around the hose is not long enough for the hose. Since the exhaust hose is exposed and very warm, some of the heat is introduced back into the room I want to cool. Wish more exhaust insulation covers were available. Maybe smaller section covers included as an extention if needed.Instructions showed it can fit a smaller window such as a 20 inch but you have to cut the window adapter to the correct size. When the two pieces of window adapter plates overlap the exhaust port hole is covered. I had to cut out the section that covers the exhaust port hole.Other than that the machine sets as cold at 64 degrees Fahrenheit, quiet, and blows fairly strong. Would buy again if I must.",4
I like that you never have to dump the water all you have to do is refill it put ice or you can use cold packs to keep the water cool very easy to use,4
"It works, just not like we hoped. Our mistake for not researching!",4
"I bought this for our tiny desert vacation home. It is a basic evaporative cooler that cools hot air by having it flow through pads that are wet with water. I fill it only with water purchased from the store because of the large calcium deposits present in the well-water in the area. It has made our small, two-room cottage very bearable, even during the hottest afternoon. It is not ""refrigerated"" like an air conditioner, but it has an area to introduce ice if you want even cooler air. The most important thing is that it's on wheels, so we can push it to wherever we need to use it. While preparing meals, we can put it in the kitchen. During the rest of the time, we keep it in the living area. Beware, however, as evaporative coolers do not work in wet climates. Only buy if you live in an area with very low humidity or it will not work.",4
This air conditioner is good for small spaces,4
"Bought 2 of these units. The worst part was putting the casters on. They did not go on easily, needed a mallet and screwdriver to slowly nudge them in. Instructions are inadequate. Had an issue with my cooler at less than a year old where the remote wasn't working properly on one, and worked perfectly on the other unit. Also, the pump was not evenly pumping water down the sides, only down the back. And I did use a de-scaler made for coolers periodically throughout its use. I also used filtered water.Contacted customer service, they were very responsive, and after some troubleshooting, they sent me a new cooler. They sent me a return label to send the old one back.This unit does the job and cools down my 15 x 25 foot studio space in 10 minutes on very hot days. I live in a hot, very dry climate. When not using the cool/water feature, the fan alove provides very nice air circulation, and I like that you can regulate the vents for the air to go where you want it.",4
This air conditioner appears to be well made. My issue was the Vent hose was not long enough and the window guard that fits exhaust peice was too long to fit the window. Allow space around unit when measuring to fit in the room you choose.,4
"For the price paid, it is a good device. Easy to start. Additional accessories are also easy to install (with user manual included). So far for a few days of very hot weather, it has been good at cooling two rooms in the house. It is over a longer period of use that we will see the quality of manufacture of this model. But so far we are satisfied. :-)I make some additions of info on this machine:It works with us from a 120 volt alternating current. I don't know if it would work well on the battery in a caravan vehicle. Additionally, this system is 28 inches tall by 12 wide; so it takes up space. For noise, it is acceptable if it is placed far enough away from where you sleep (we can compare it to the sound of a refrigerator).",4
"Plus, as the air cools i barley see condensation forms and drips into drainpipe !",4
"Like the features, happy with the venting. Most important they cool not just 1 room but that wing of the house.",4
"This review is about the VCJ Portable Evaporative Air Cooler, which i bought for our patio. I was looking for something for our back porch, to keep us cool during the summer. and we came across this Air-cooler. The Unit is about 41' or 42 in height, connects thru an AC power cord. (no batteries required.) Also included are 6 ice pks, to keep the water cool. (But you can also add ice) The water tank is at the bottom, water is pored into it from the top tray. which then goes down into the tank. the water tank fills up about 3-4 jugs. (which last a long time.) i believe 3 or 4 days, maybe longer. The unit has 4 wheels, easy for pushing or pulling, to place right where you want it. The front vents are moveable up or down. to get the cool air on that perfect spot. it blows enough air, (about 8 or 9 feet away.) Honesty the coldness is not gonna beat a real home A/C. I would say that while it does a good job at blowing a lot of air. the coldness is about a 6 or 7 out of 10. which means that you can feel it. So NO! it wont leave you sweating. or hot. It also comes with button that moves the air left and right (which i didnt even know when i bought it.) lol The Unit has a nob for power on and off, as well as how high you want it..Low mid or high. numbred as 1, 2, 3. Personally i liked it. my family likes it. even my dog loves the freash air., lol I would buy again for me or as a gift. If you are looking for a budget air cooling A/C for either indoors or out. give this1 a try.",4
I love this case! I had recently cracked the entire back of my phone due to having a non- protective case on it. I ordered this otter box because it’s cute but also provides protection. It fits my phone perfectly and is very comfortable to hold. It has protected the camera in the back and is very durable - I don’t even have a scratch on it yet!,5
"I’ve been through a few phone cases for my iPhone 14 Pro Max and haven’t found one that fits it well (particularly around the rear facing camera)…until now! I don’t understand how so many different cases don’t fit something as popular as an iPhone (especially in the exact same place and way). The magnet is the right amount of strength too, not at all weak so holds on to my car mount, but easy to remove if you are intentionally trying to remove it from a mount or charger.",5
"I love this phone case. It’s not bulk or slippery and I love the shimmer. I also use a metal magnetic mag safe pop socket and it sticks amazingly. I’ve dropped my phone several times with this case on and it protects it. Otter box is great! I just bought a new one to replace my old one, which was about a year and a half old. They last a long time but it will yellow over time. I recommend replacing once a year to keep it looking clear and pretty.",5

"I wanted to buy another laptop for work purposes but also be useful for travelling and for gaming so I saw this laptop for sale during Black Friday! Excellent purchase! Here is my pros and cons after a week of owning this:Con:1. 1920 x 1200 FHD 165Hz Display is very much an downgrade against my Legion 5 Pro 16"" 2560 x 1600 IPS LCD 165Hz Display... But I guess with the parts offered, ASUS had to make some budget cuts somewhere I guess... (for the model I've chosen and not wanting to spend more than $1500 USD).2. Automatic MUX Switching is annoying... it optimizes which option to best suit for your current usage at the time (e.g. if you ran an game vs closing the game and brings you to the desktop). The automatic switch seems like its great and all but it ruins the display setting and when an game is playing, it switches again and sends you back to the desktop and ruins the display setting/resolution once more... Its best to just set it on the dedicated GPU option so you dont have to deal with this...3. Standard SSD Capacity is too low (again with cost saving measures but literally everyone these days just buy additional SSD stick anyways)... so snagged an SK.Hynix P41 SSD 2TB stick on sale to manually install for loading heavy application and games on there; really easy to install and easy to unscrew the back; there is an empty NVMe Gen4 M.2 2280 slot for you to install your SSDWorks Great after installing correctly and no Issues now! (make sure after install of SSD, just load into Windows and open up disk management to reformat (quick format! never full on SSD!) No need to tinker with BIOS setting...Do not tighten the SSD screws too much where the stick bends! thats incorrect! screw in ever so slightly so that the stick itself wont lodge out or move at all.Pros:1. RTX 4060 8GB - 140W Max TGP2. i7-13650HX - beats my Ryzen-7 5800H on my Legion 5 Pro3. RGB bar looks awesome!4. Battery 90WhNeutral:1. RGB Keys - heard mixed reviews on ASUS's design on this; of course, the Legion 5 RGB keyboard design is the best of the best but this is just okay and its not too bad in my eyes.2. Same weight and nearly the same dimensions as my Legion 5 Pro so portability is the same-ish but way better than my old MSI gaming laptop from 2017 where you can put this in your backpack and still have room to put other accessories and such.This is all I've noticed currently but either way, its a great mid-tier gaming laptop! I can run cyberpunk all max setting without issues or framerate drops and every other AAA game titles up to this point... This laptop should last an long time until AAA games becomes more graphically intense and requiring more processing power... but again this is the best you can get for your money and highly recommend!",5
I like that's nearly the quietest laptop compared to its competitors with same specs. also I'm impressedwith the GPU performance.maybe there's some coilwhine yeah but very minor to notice.overall I really like it!!,5
"The laptop performs well, with about 4 months of usage and it is still rock solid.",5
"I invested in the Amazon Basics Stainless Steel Comfort Grip Knife Set, and my kitchen experience has been nothing short of wonderful. This 18-piece set is a complete arsenal for all your culinary adventures. With each knife designed for a specific task, it's like having a professional kitchen right on your countertop.The first thing that caught my eye was the sleek design and the comfort grip handles. These knives not only look gorgeous on my kitchen counter, but the grip is so ergonomic that chopping has become a less tedious task. The brushed stainless steel handles offer a secure and comfortable grip, making the knives easy to control even during demanding tasks.The high carbon stainless steel blades are the stars of the show. They are stain, rust, and pit resistant, which is a testament to their durability. With a satin finish, they glide through ingredients with ease. The variety of knives in this set is impressive, catering to all kinds of food prep tasks like chopping, cutting, slicing, peeling, and much more.Now, while the knives are sharp and ready to use out of the box, I did notice that they might need frequent sharpening with heavy use. The good news is that the set includes a sharpening steel, so keeping the blades sharp and ready is not a chore.The rubber wood block that houses the knives is compact and stylish, fitting well in any kitchen setting. The set includes a chef's knife, bread knife, ham knife, santoku knife, utility knife, vegetable knife, paring knife, sharpening steel, and eight steak knives, all neatly organized in a rubber wood block.The affordability of this set is a cherry on top. It's a budget-friendly option without compromising on quality or functionality. The Amazon Basics Stainless Steel Comfort Grip Knife Set is indeed a valuable addition to any kitchen. The quality, the range of knives, and the price point make it a commendable choice. I highly recommend this set to anyone looking to upgrade their kitchen game without breaking the bank.",5
"I needed some knives for a horror movie I'm filming. I don't want people to die but I love making movies about it. I needed a block of knives that weren't good chef's knives but that we could use to film.They look GREAT on camera!!! Not the best for cooking if you're a chef but you already know that. They came sharp and even made the ""shink!"" sound when pulled out.If you actually care about good knives, get good knives. These are fine as a movie prop.",5
"I love the price of these. They're very basic, run-of-the-mill knives, but the product is well made. I needed a new set of knives on a budget (my old dull ones weren't very practical) and these showed up on my page. Very nice product for the price, allowed me to get a new set of knives on a budget",5
Great value for the money! You get alot of knives in this set and also many different types depending on the use you need. They are VERY sharp and cut beautifully,5
I am really happy with this knife set. The block is beautiful on its own and the knives are terrific. I would highly recommend this high-quality knife set.,5
Very sharp and pretty set,5
i got these to replace an old set that was missing(thanks honey) pieces. it's true apparently they don't make good gardening tools. I've been using them for a while now and can vouch for their build quality. they work very well and i use them every day. it's a lovely set and perfect for someone on a budget or a gift for the child who finally moved out... just saying.,5
"I love these knives! The block is nice, the craftsmanship really shines, and was sooooo happy with how affordable they were. Just be careful cause they’re hella sharp!",5
"No negatives. This faucet was super easy to install, and it looks great! I needed a way to dispense water from the under counter filtered water system without drilling a hole in the granite. This faucet is the perfect solution. It easily connected to the filter system (Aquasana) without any additional hardware. To dispense the filtered water through the cross bar simply pull the lever straight down. The quality of the faucet is high end, heavy duty and sturdy. I love the way the black and brushed nickel finish goes with my countertop. I also love how firmly the nozzle retracts and stays up without sagging down.",5
I wanted a nice looking faucet that I could use for reverse osmosis & regular water. This fit the bill. Gorgeous & functional! Don’t hesitate to buy it.,5
"Looks great 10/10 and a very easy installationLove that it doesn’t smear or get dirty fastFeels very durable and solid , water flow is amazing high flow and doesn’t leak at all",5
I have made the mistake of going the cheap route with kitchen hardware because brands like Moen and Kohler are always beyond expensive. Kraus feels like a well established brand that continues to try and sell quality products at a great price point. I also got a sink from them (amazon open box) and both looks amazing compared to what we had before. The filtered drinking water option is also a godsend.,5
"Great faucet, absolutely love it. Wanted to save on counter space so needed a faucet that combined RO into the same faucet. Have it for a while already and works great. No complaints at all.",5
Easy to install and very nice quality. Looks great in our kitchen.,5
"Have been using this for over a month now, and it's been great! Good build quality, looks great, and having the filtered water built-in as opposed to needing to drill a separate hole in the counter is really convenient (and works well)! I would highly recommend this faucet.EDIT: Following up again 7 months later, and this faucet is still great! It remains sturdy and still looks great.",5
"Very few kitchen faucets that include a dedicated separate filtered water tap. This saved me the toil of drilling a hole on my ceramic sink for a separate filtered water tap.Works well and is well built, albeit somewhat pricey. Mine was discounted as it was used, otherwise I would have been hesitant. In retrospect I would not have greatly regretted paying full price.Installation instructions were easy to follow.",5
"Perfect product if you have a RO system under the sink and you don't one an extra faucet. Looks really good, and minimal it's easy to install and to use.The colour is a true champagne gold and not as ""yellow"" as it looks in the pictures.",5
"This faucet is awesome for those who wants to add RO water to without drilling a hole. The nut design is super easy to install, it has two Philip screws that does the final tightening; brilliant.For me, I took the old RO water hole and turn it into a glass rinser.",5
"I'll cut to the chase for anyone who simply wants to know if Vitamix blenders are worth the investment. My answer is yes. Unequivocally.This is my second Vitamix. My first one (the 6300) is about 7 years old & STILL going strong, but I was happy to have the opportunity to try this new Ascent X4 because of the presets for many of the things I commonly blend. The 5 presets (smoothies, frozen desserts, soups, frozen cocktails, and last but not least, dips & spreads) take the guesswork out of which settings to use for many of the types of foods & beverages that I make on a regular basis.So far, I've used the presets on my Ascent X4 to blend smoothies & frappes and to clean my container when I've finished using it. (Btw, not that it was difficult to do this manually with my 6300, but I love the self-cleaning feature!) In addition, even though there's no preset for it on this model I was still able to make a great, super-smooth batch of almond butter with help from the ""dips and spreads"" setting, too!More things I love about the Ascent X series:- 10-year warranty -- almost unheard of these days- smart technology that tells me when I should use the tamper (if I'm not already using it)- clever tamper storage that conveniently fits on either side (I'll never need to hunt for it again!)- ability to blend manually without using a preset and includes a ""pulse"" feature- additional 15 seconds can be added with one touch on the ""15+""- motorized base accepts all self-detect containers, including a food processor (I can hardly wait to get that one!)- container is dishwasher safe (it self-cleans exceptionally well but some might like this option)- easy to see when it's *powered on -- lights appear on the display, or off -- no lights (*Btw, the power button is hidden on the lower right side of the base beneath the edge. I say this because I had trouble finding it myself, lol.)I'll end with the fact that Vitamix stands 100% behind their products and the company has STELLAR customer service. If there's any issue with your blender or its components it's easy to contact them by phone. Not only do you get to talk with a real person, but those who answer calls are friendly, knowledgeable & helpful. I speak from experience.",5
"I bought a Vitamix in 1999, and it's still going strong to this day. I have used and abused it over the years and it just keeps on going. I wanted to get a more modern version that has electronic optionsfor pre-programmed features like smoothies, etc. I have to admit that I was a little concerned that Vitamix would follow the trend of many popular, formerly high-quality brands by making products *look* better while lessening overall quality. I'm relieved to report that as far as I can tell, this machine is still a high quality machine that I would expect from Vitamix. The base and motor sounds feel and sound familiar... like an old friend. I love that even though there are pre-programmed functions, you still have the option to run the machine like an old Vitamix. That is, on/off and a dial to hone in on the perfect speed for what you're making. You can turn it on and go without having to navigate menus to find a ""manual"" mode. For professional chefs and experienced home cooks, this is important.The pre-programmed options are great. Combined with the extensive recipe book, you can make flawless recipes! If you're a beginner home cook, this machine could change your life.One thing I made all the time in my previous Vitamix is hummus, so that's the first thing I tried in the new one. And when I say I make hummus, I start by making tahini from sesame seeds and oil. The Vitamix handled this step flawlessly. In seconds, I had a beautiful tahini base for my hummus. Next I added chickpeas, lemon, salt and a bit of water. This Vitamix made a beautiful, super creamy and smooth hummus. I know some people like hummus that's a little rough, but I prefer a super smooth one and that's completely doable in this Vitamix.I was kind of hoping that in their years of R&D that they would have found a way to make it easier to get thick food like hummus out of the canister more easily, but that's a big ask. So I did have to use a spatula to get all the goodness out of the bottom.I have made some smoothies, mayo and potato soup -- all things my previous Vitamix did effortless, and this new model handles all these tasks without complaining. It truly is a beautiful machine and I'm really excited to keep using it and trying new things.My only concern for the future is the electronics side of things. I hope they engineered that as well as the motor and other physical aspects. With the old Vitamix, there are 2 switches and a dial. There's not much to go wrong as long the motor is working. And Vitamix makes powerful and quality motors, which is why my 25 year-old Vitamix shows no signs of slowing down today. Since I can't really test the electronics side of things, I'm really hoping they did put the R&D and build quality into that side of things as well.Overall, I'm super happy with this latest professional grade model and am so happy that Vitamix is still making high-quality and user-friendly products!",5
"I can now make dinner in a flash - and saves my sanity when chopping broccoli.No more mess in the kitchen, it works great and is of really good quality.Blades are sharp and I love the tool to protect your fingers which does not come with the other models I have seen.Does require some strength though - my kids struggle with harder veggies so I had to help.Popped everything in the dishwasher after use and made cleaning up so easy. We love it so far.",5
This chopper is awesome. I have a single chopper but this was is so fast and easy to use and clean.,5
"I have almost nothing to complain about with this kit. It cuts effortlessly compared to the cheaper one I used to have. Doesnt really matter what, onions, peppers, apples, carrots, potatoes, all of them go through it like a hot knife through butter. The ergonomics are great, I will say that I have yet to use the mandoline portion on top. Just haven't had a use case yet. But if the blades in that are as good as they are in the chopper, I don't doubt that it will have just as good as an experience. The storage for the blades is convenient and well thought out. I especially love the little comb that you can use to clean out the plate that pushes things through the blades. It makes cleaning up much easier than any previous chopper that I've used. My only real complaint about this is that the container that the chopped food enters is a bit too short. This both limits how much you can chop before having to empty the container, and it also prevents you from being able to fully close the chopper up with all the blades in their storage recepticles. Its a bit of a nitpick honestly. But it would be nice to have everything securely in one spot without having to worry about anything falling out if it gets tipped over.Other than that, great buy, highly recommend. Also I love the color!",5
"It’s sharp, easy to assemble, and saves time chopping vegetables. Highly recommend!",5
"I got this dicer for 50% off, I think, paying only $30 or so for a normally $60 dicer. This is the first dicer that I have ever owned, although I have used a friend's dicer, and I will say that this cuts through about anything that you would need to dice in the kitchen. Like most dicers, stuff gets caught and stuck in the blades and the platform thingy, and it's a little hard to wash, especially because those blades are seriously sharp. An onion stands no chance against those blades. All of the different tools/slicers are really awesome and work really well for the most part.It isn't quite as big as what I thought it would be when I purchased it, and to give you an idea, most of the time I need to quarter an onion in order for it to be diced correctly and not smush out of the sides. If it's a small onion, you can fit half of it in the dicing area and get it done that way. I am extremely happy with the purchase overall, especially at that price, and it has taken away a lot of frustration and time when I cook. Next time, I will probably get one that's a little bigger, but this is most definitely a game changer by itself. Highly recommend this dicer. Just be careful with those blades! They are super sharp and got two of us bleeding within the first three or four days. Lol",5
"This chopper is just awesome . Nicely built , no cheap plastic . And all blades are sharp .",5
Solid and great quality. The blades are thick and the plastic parts do not feel flimsy. Very useful.,5
Highly recommended,5
"The media could not be loaded. I recently upgraded my kitchen with the CAROTE 11-piece Non-Stick Pots and Pans Set, and it's been a game-changer for my cooking routine. The cream white color gives my kitchen a clean, modern look, and the non-stick surface truly lives up to its claims. Food slides right off, making both cooking and cleanup a breeze. I love that I can use less oil, and even delicate foods like eggs don’t stick, which makes every meal feel healthier and fresher.One of my favorite features is the removable handle, which is incredibly practical. It snaps on and off easily, so I can transfer pots from stovetop to oven or fridge without taking up extra space or needing separate storage for bulky handles. This space-saving design has been perfect for my small kitchen and would be amazing for anyone with limited storage or even an RV setup. Plus, the set is induction-compatible, which opens up a lot of versatility, especially if you have mixed appliances.Overall, this CAROTE cookware set has been an ideal addition to my kitchen. It's lightweight but durable, easy to clean, and does everything I need it to do, from stovetop to oven to fridge. It’s been a worthwhile investment, and I can tell it’s going to last me a long time. If you’re looking for a practical, stylish, and space-efficient cookware set, I highly recommend giving CAROTE a try!",5
"Absolutely amazing!!! Best purchase I’ve done in a while. The coating makes it super easy to cook and food really doesn’t stick, even with small amounts of oil or similar. The removable handles are great and easy to apply and remove. The color is lovely, the little dots give it a little extra something that looks very nice. The fact that you can take them from stove to oven to the table and they still look cute it’s definitely a great extra. Heat distribution is amazing! Everything cooks very evenly! The stacking makes is easier to store and they are also super easy to clean.",5
"I bought these to save my time in the kitchen, and the results are better than expected. I like the detachable handles, since they allow me to squeeze more pots on my stovetop, while eliminated bumping a handle and spilling the contents. They nest well in a drawer, using less than half the space required by my old pots. The non stick coating has held up very well, and I am saving more time than I planned when cleaning them",5
"“I am absolutely thrilled with this CAROTE Pots and Pans Set! The non-stick coating works flawlessly, making cooking and cleanup a breeze. I love the space-saving design – the detachable handle is such a clever feature, especially for storing everything neatly in my small kitchen and even fitting them in the fridge! The cream white color adds a touch of elegance, and the set is versatile enough for all my cooking needs. It heats evenly on my induction stovetop, and being oven-safe is a huge plus. This set has truly upgraded my cooking experience – I can’t recommend it enough!”",5
I've been looking at these for a while and finally gave in and got them. I have an issue with my pots and pans not being able to fit into the cupboard properly number one because they don't all settle into each other perfectly and the handles stick out. So far they seem to cook through very evenly they're heavy weight and easy to clean. They're very pretty looking and it's super convenient to have the handle store next to it. Also the lids are nice that they function is a cover and the whole pan and lid can be put into your refrigerator together or take into another person's house. It eliminates the need for Tupperware. For the price I have found these in extremely good buy and would recommend them to other people,5
"As an avid cook, I’ve been searching for the perfect pots and pans for a long time, and after trying many, I can't believe I didn't discover these sooner! These pots and pans are lightweight yet durable, with a non-stick surface that makes cooking and cleaning a breeze. I ended up discarding half a dozen of my old ones after using these. What I love most is how they store in my cabinet – the detachable handles allow me to stack them neatly, saving so much space. Plus, the inclusion of high-quality felt sheets for protection shows they really care about the product’s longevity. The price is great, and I will definitely buy these again as gifts!",5
"The media could not be loaded. I recently purchased the T-fal Ultimate Hard Anodized Nonstick Fry Pan Set, and it has quickly become a staple in my kitchen. The nonstick coating is impressive – even with minimal oil, food slides right off without sticking. This makes cooking so much easier and clean-up even faster, as I can simply wipe the pans with a sponge and they’re good as new. Another thing I love is how evenly these pans heat up; whether I’m cooking vegetables or frying eggs, there are no hot spots, so everything cooks perfectly. The set feels durable and well-made, with comfortable handles that stay cool while cooking. Overall, this set is an excellent value for anyone looking for quality, user-friendly frying pans.",5
"I'm doing an initial review of this cookware set. As it's being used, my intention is to come back to this review with updates.I ordered this set after doing a bit of 'googling' on what is the best cookware set for 2019 - I wanted something for our gas range. I think it's something to take into consideration when choosing what you're going to buy. An example - on a gas range - if the setting is high and your cookware has some sort of enamel-like finish, and the flames are coming over the sides of the pot/pan - it's going to discolor the finish after a period of time.I looked at the top 10 bracket, the top 5 bracket, I went to reviews, Good Housekeeping, Consumer Reports, just to name two of several, and surprisingly (at least for me) T-Fal was a set that kept popping up as one of the best. I've always thought of T-Fal as one of those starter cookware sets that someone might purchase when they're moving into their first apartment and starting out on their own - it is/was inexpensive - a set for a person learning to cook and therefore not requiring something more 'higher-end.' If you have/had those thoughts as well, you might want to set them aside, at least with this set..Upon pulling everything out of the box my first impression was they look really nice. The set is light weight - the handles are riveted, silicone encased and can withstand up to 400 degree oven temperature. The lids are heavy tempered glass, each one having a small vent hole, and the handles are also silicone encased as well. The design of the lid-handles seems to take into account the use of pot holders since there's substantial space between the glass and the handle itself. All of the lids in my set fit nicely onto their respective pot/pan - no warpage or bent rims. The pots/pans are dishwasher safe (mine aren't going to see the inside of a dishwasher), and this particular set you can use metal utensils (I personally ain't-a-gonna do it). It comes with a steamer that is designed to stack on top of the large pot (not the dutch oven). When you're done steaming, grab some pot holders and lift the insert out by it's handles - no muss, no fuss. It's a much better option than the collapsible steamer I currently using.It comes with instructions on how to care for your cookware. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS! Why you may ask? This set is replacing a Calphalon set, and yes Calphalon was/is rated highly as well. But why replace it? Because being the knuckle head that I am, I didn't read the instructions. I knew Calphalon had to be hand washed (at least the set that I own) - but what I didn't know was what high heat does to the pots. When you read the instructions for T-Fal, and because it's aluminum, it'll say something to the effect of using low to medium heat (because aluminum conducts heat really well). See … I didn't know that about anodized aluminum and what I ended up doing was burning the finish off of each pot and skillet bottom of my Calphalon set - right down to the bare aluminum and of course this affected the non-stick surface on the inside. So please, read and follow the instructions. One other thing before I wrap this up. When I was doing my 'research' I came across this one video of an owner showing how an empty T-Fal pot didn't sit level on her stove. Seems the handle was heavy enough that it caused the pot to tip. She said this was a problem - and I guess it could be if you're in the process of putting something inside the pot in preparation of cooking. I do get that - but I placed an empty pot on the stove, centered over the burner, and it sat just fine - although I'll say my stove grate is different than the stove in the video - it also sat level on the counter top. Perhaps this might be something to take into consideration???So initial impression is the set seems to be of good quality, looks nice, and I'm looking forward to putting this set through it's paces.UPDATE:As of December 4, 2019 I have to say that the T-Fal set has held up extremely well - cooking with this set is a breeze. I keep the burner setting usually at med-high if I want to bring something to a boil - and it doesn't take long for that to happen. The pots and pans conduct heat really well and there's practically no sticking. Usually I can pretty-much rinse off any food residue left behind using just running hot water. I'm pretty good at using either wooden or silicon-type utensils when cooking, though on occasion I've used metal spoons to stir, and there are no marks inside any of the pots/pans. I'm not one of those cooks adept enough to shift a pan around and flip the contents briefly into the air (my cool-factor is not that high) so ""skating"" the bottom of a pot/pan over the cast-iron grate has not taken place, so I can't say what would happen to this set if I were to do so. If I were to hazard a guess, I would say that more than likely there would be some marring of the bottom since cast iron probably trumps aluminum. Overall I'm very please with this purchase and the performance of this cook set.",5
"I try to wait on reviews so that I can provide an accurate and fair review. This was a great purchase. These pans look amazing and are very sturdy. Stick fee is 5 stars. Durability 5 stars. Look new after 6 months. Easy to keep clean. After 6 months no scratches or marks. I will admit that I an very careful about cleaning and us only cloth or sponge as I have ruined other, more expensive brands in the past.",5
"We all have some of these: chipped, scratched pots and pans that wobble on a range because of being WARPED. I've had enough with my pans and began research on cookeware sets. I will note here that my current cookware is the high end non-stick, with my fry pans being those bought after watching some fool on TV melt candy in a wrapper in the pan and then wiping it clean. (These pans by the way are only 8 months old and are already WARPED). For new cookware, my ONE main requirement was that they were or would be NON-WARPING. The second requirement was that they be non-stick. After some research I settled on the 14 piece of T-Fal non-stick / non-warp set. Item came well packaged and unpacking the items I was impressed with the feel of each piece: not too heavy or light even with a lid. I also noted the non-stick interior surface and the very nice looking anodized exterior. Very nice touch with the vented lids (an actual hole in the glass) and the FULL insulation of the handles. Now I mention this insulation because I have (had) cookware items that had decorative (?) metal ends on the handles that would occasionally get very warm while being used.( Nothing like grabbing a pot or pan handle that want to cook your hand medium rare.) I washed each piece and WITHOUT SEASONING, took the largest frying pan, placed it on the range on MED HEAT (about 5-6 on an electric glass top range) and let it heat up. After 2-3 minutes, I noted that the T-FAL center emblem in the pan really didn't look like it changed much. I expected it to go from the T-FAL logo to a full red dot. Didn't happen but it was no biggie as in the past several months I began preheating my fry pans for about 3 minutes due to their warped exterior. Next I added magarine as I was going to cook sunnyside up eggs. I was impressed to note that the margarine melted quickly AND when spread about the pan, little bubbles began to show up over the ENTIRE pan surface. This meant that the pan was heating up evenly. In went the eggs and after placing a lid on the pan I turned away to get something off the counter. Now, with my older warped fry pans I could do this same act, return to the range and begin to slowly rotate the pan to get even heating on the eggs. Not so with this T-Fal fry pan. I noted the whites turning opaque quickly and the yolks getting their whitish color meaning they would be just slightly runny. In short, these eggs came out perfect and in well over 1/2 the time from my old cookware. Even my other half was impressed. Now my next ""adventures in cooking"" will involve sautéing, making my alfredo sauce, grilling (this set came with a VERY NICE grill pan!) and frying. So far I am following the instructions by keeping the range heat at MED or just a bit more. Noted is that one foray into frying eggs does not provide enough experience with this cookware to turn cartwheels in the kitchen. But so far, with eggs being one of my more difficult items to make because of my other warped pans with uneven heat, this T-Fal pan is impressive. So, my rating of 4 is tentative as I will update this review within a short time after I try other pieces of this set.UPDATE:First this disclaimer: I HAVE NOT and AM NOT an employee of T-Fal or Amazon, and I have NOT been hired to write a raving review. That said, now for the update. I have had this set now for over a month and have used all but one of the pans. The total experience has been incredible. I cook out of self-defense (the other half is banned by the EPA from boiling water) and am pretty fast in the kitchen when I am cooking.- WEIGHT OF PANS: I thought the pans were a bit on the light side until I started using them. Whether it was thought of during design or not, the pans are heavy enough to withstand various cooking requirements but light enough where you don't break your wrist when lifting.- NON STICK SURFACE: Come on now! Who in their right mind melts plastic spoons or uses an electric beater on their non-stick cookware! I believe surface of this T-Fal would take this abuse with no problem, but I happen to like my food without the taste of plastic. I've used nearly all the pans and found them all to be amazingly non-stick as well as sturdy. I still use butter/olive oil when sautéing or frying. I have had nothing stick to the pans nor have any of these pans lost any of their non-stick capability.- HEATING: This is the BEST part of this cookware. If you cook/have cooked with slightly warped cookware, you know the problem with hot heat spots or very little heat at all. Thus, you have to move the pan around a bit to get yours items cooked. Each of the pans in this T-Fal set has VERY even heat distribution. There is a ""plate"" on the bottom of the pans that distributes the heat evenly. I have found that because of this, I've noted shorter cooking times on various items AND I now cook on a lower heat settings NOTE: This T-Fal cookware set will cause you to change how your cook and for how long. The even heat distribution is stunning. ALSO, I do preheat my pans (except for boiling water) and use only wooden or high heat tolerant silicone utensils..- STORAGE OF THE COOKWARE: I don't stack this cookware. Instead I hang it up. This simply helps prolong the life of my investment.Overall, I am very impressed with this cookware. Even my other half (known for making ANGRY little pellets called hamburgers), has begun to learn that this cookware can even make her a decent cook. And yes, I bit on the late night adverts showing the frying pans melting plastic spoons and candy in wrappers and magically not sticking. I bought 3. Within 90 days they either lost their non-stick capability, began to warp, or both.Some people are gourmet cooks; others have trouble boiling water. This cookware will holdup very well and serve both very well. My motto is that you get what you pay for. And you WILL get more than you've paid for this set. I raise my rating to 5 stars and I do recommend as a BUY.",5
This set of pots is amazing!! They are truly non-stick which makes cooking and cleaning easier. They are worth the price. I would recommend this set to others.,5
"I've had these for a few months now and they have been fantastic. They seem very sturdy, they are easy to clean and everything I've made in them has cooked evenly and nothing has stuck to the pans. I am very happy with this purchase.",5
"While I can't give you a review on durability yet, I can say they seem nice. All parts cake in that I know of. The silicone seems sturdy, I like the fit of the lids and it stacks rather nicely imo. I don't see how a bowl wouldn't be functional, there's really no way to mess that up. I ordered black and think they look pretty sharp. The tools that came with it are small imo also but I wasn't expecting much, they were just kind of a bonus to me really.Enjoy",5
"These bowls and lids are great. I love the shredder and slicer and they clean up easily in the dishwasher. I recommend placing the lids on the top dishwasher rack to ensure the lids maintain their shape but even on the bottom they maintain their shape and seal if you place them on the bowls and leave them on for a while. The sizes allow you to measure, mix, and store right in the bowls. The silicone base is the best feature and provides a firm foundation as you mix vigorously. The extra measuring tools and silicone utensils are a nice bonus. Would buy again as a gift!",5
"Great set of bowls, the rubber bottom really does a great job of keeping it from sliding. Nice variety if sizes, the lid seals well enough for me to use them for storage as well as mixing. I have been washing them in the dishwasher since I got them with now issues. They store easily as well.Some issues with scratching on the insides if the bowl but not a concern",5
"I've been trying to get rid of my glass mixing bowls and I wanted something durable that wasn't plastic. I saw this set and I gave it a try. Best purchase I've made in a while... I LOVE THEM! Durable with a nice rubber bottom. The lids fit like a glove and they are perfectly stackable. The bonus... is the bowl with the slicing and grating attachments. All I do is open the covered hole on the lid, add the attachment and I slice and grate in the bowl. Save me time and clean up. It came with some silicone utensils, measuring cups and spoon. This was a true bonus buy!",5
They look nice! They fit in my cabinets perfectly. They are good quality and can be used for many things. They work good and are easy to clean. I would recommend these if you like to bake they have many sizes.,5
"I got this to take camping. It works great, love how the bowls stack together. Love the non-slip bottoms. The extras - utensils, measuring cups, etc - where great to throw in our camping tub. The lids aren't water-proof, so if you are bringing stuff home in a cooler full of melting ice, keep that in mind. Otherwise, we love it!",5
"There are many items included with this purchase. The utensils are pretty small, but it all works. The use of the cheese grater and other items is nice to have.",5
I love the size and colors,5
"This is the second one I purchased for gifts; I use one myself in the kitchen. I'm a knife collector, as far as chef knives go. A $200 one will not be better. It has a VG 10 core for edge retention. It looks good. Its high chromium/ Nikkel content makes it rust-resistant. It's full-tang, and, best of all, it's very sharp. Quality, appearance, value, weight, balance, comfort, ease of use, ease of cleaning; It's all there. This is a knife every kitchen should have. Highly recommended.",5
They seem to hold an edge and sharpen well also. a good medium priced tool.,5
I started home cooking and got this knifeIt is smooth cutting meat and vegetablesIt’s almost 3 months but still works like the first day,5
Gorgeous blade and exceptionally sharp that holds an edge even with an aggressive bevel.Full tang blade and is surprisingly weighty but no so unwieldy as to be clumsy.It will be the first knife in the drawer you reach for. We all have that one tool that just makes your life easier.,5
Wonderful cutting edge. Also it is sent in a beautiful box which works well for storing the sharp blade.,5
"I seen a few negative reviews about rust, FYI moisture is the worst enemy to this type of steel.Here is how to care for your Damascus Blade. I collect Katanas, which are all Hand Forged blades.FYI: the picture of knife darkens the blade so you can see the Design.When heat treated and used in a blade this combination holds an excellent edge. The blade will gain an attractive patina with prolonged use as with any Carbon steel based blade. The colour and character of the patina is determined by the type of ingredients and food the blade is used to cut. For example, cooked red meat creates a beautiful blue-grey patina that will be familiar to anyone who has encountered heirloom carving knives.Caring for your blade:Caring for a Damascus steel blade is much the same as for a Carbon steel blade - moisture is the enemy. Once the blade has built up a patina it is much more forgiving, but a fresh Carbon steel based blade will begin to rust in a heartbeat.Never, ever: NEVER!Leave the blade resting in standing waterRest the blade on a damp tea towel, wash cloth, etcStore in direct contact with leatherWash in a dishwasherTo help your Damascus steel knife become a heirloom, there are only a few things you need to do.After use:Rinse clean under running water and wipe dry with a clean clothLightly oil using food safe oilStore in a dry placeWhile your blade is still developing a patina, it is a good idea to quickly wipe the blade down before moving on to a food preparation task not involving the knife.Oiling - (I use Japanese Sword Choji Oil)- https://www.amazon.com/The-Institute-of-Asian-Arts/dp/B0061LS2SY?th=1&psc=1A common mistake when oiling a blade is to use something like olive oil that will go rancid. I recommend Choji oil, as it is food safe, cheap, and readily available.WashingMany people new to Damascus steel knives approach washing their blades with trepidation. Cleaning your knife is straightforward: rinse it under running water, give it a wipe with a lightly soapy dish sponge, rinse it again and wipe dry. If you’re familiar with the term “Bachelor Wash” (or can decipher the connotation), this is all it takes.Refreshing the patternThe Damascus pattern will fade with use - this is normal and easy to rectify. Hot black instant coffee (cheap, nasty, and mixed at a ratio that would kill a large animal) is a mild etchant that is used as the final stage of the Damascus etching process. It is element of process that contributes most to the blackness of the pattern.Here’s how to refresh your own blades:Brew a batch of the cheapest and nastiest black instant coffee you can get your hands on. You’ll need enough to immerse the blade in.Wash the blade, then thoroughly wipe it down with methylated spirits to remove oils and contaminantsImmerse the blade in the instant coffee, heating the coffee back up if it’s gone cold (heat increases the rate of reaction). Take care to avoid getting coffee on the handle.Expect the process to take anywhere between 15 minutes and an hour. Check the blade every 15 minutes by removing it from the coffee and allowing the coffee to drip off. Do not touch or wipe down the blade at any point.When the desired results have been achieved, remove the blade from the coffee then wash as normal before oiling and storing.",5
Very good Quality,5
"The media could not be loaded. The best part is the smooth gliding RAZOR edge this knife has out of the box. It's a Chinese made VG-10 steel, damascus style (I can't verify how many layers this really has), but VG-10 steel has a great reputation. The knife shipped OVERNIGHT and by coincidence, I bought fresh Walleye AKA Pickerel today at the grocery store. I've used a survival knife to do this before, but it left way too much meat on the skin. This knife just slid right through. If you're OK buying a knife made in China, I'd pick one of these up. The hype is real.Downsides:1) Nobody can really say if this is damascus or just damascus style, nor have I used it for more than one task, but without seeing the manufacture process, it may or may not be.Fun facts:The VG10 steel is native to Japan. 9CRMOV10 or whatever the top rated Japanese knives are made of is a Chinese steel, copying the VG10. How can a genuine Japanese chef knife (like most of the top rated ones) be made out of a Chinese composition steel, yet still be Japanese? This Japanese STYLE chef knife is made from higher grade steel than any of the Chinese 9CRMOV10ABC steel used in most top rated competitors and it's cheaper.Good stuff gets made in China, and so does junk. For the price point, VG-10 steel and quality so far, I'd have to say this is an excellent knife and not junk.Update Several months later: I can still shave with the blade. To be safe and remove any micro burrs, I dragged it through a ceramic v shaped sharpener for three passes, applying no pressure other than the weight of the knife. The blade is still scalpel sharp and glides through EVERYTHING. USE A WOODEN CUTTING BOARD! ANY blade will eventually suffer damage if it's slammed into a glass cutting board or countertop enough times. I didn't HAVE to use the ceramic either. Removing any micro abrasions from any blade helps them stay sharp, but not essential for this knife. It stayed razor sharp on it's own, so I take good care of it.The hamon line on the edge and damascus pattern in the blade are incredible! From one steel worker to another: great job! Worth EVERY PENNY!",5

"The KitchenAid All Purpose Kitchen Shears have quickly become a staple in my everyday kitchen tasks. These shears combine durability, precision, and convenience, making them a must-have for any home cook.Right out of the box, the quality is evident. The stainless steel blades are sharp and sturdy, perfect for cutting through a variety of ingredients from herbs to poultry. The comfortable handles provide a secure grip, reducing hand fatigue during extended use.One of the standout features is the protective sheath. It keeps the blades safe and clean when not in use, and the built-in blade guard adds an extra layer of safety, which is especially important in a busy kitchen.Versatility is another major plus. I've used these shears for everything from trimming vegetables to opening packaging. The blades are easy to clean, and they remain sharp even after repeated use.Overall, the KitchenAid All Purpose Kitchen Shears with Protective Sheath are a fantastic investment for anyone looking to enhance their kitchen tool arsenal. Their combination of quality, versatility, and safety makes them a perfect addition to any kitchen. Highly recommended!",5
"Ultra sharp (cause it’s new) but I have high hopes. I particularly love the large handles for bigger hands. These kitchen shears cut through anything and at a reasonable price. The best park is since they are like regular scissors instead of that serrated crap, you can sharpen them if they get dull. I started using then to cut herbs and lettuces with great success and no bruising to delicate leaves. I highly recommend.",5
"These kitchen scissors have quickly become one of my most-used tools! They’re super sharp and make quick work of everything from cutting herbs to slicing through packaging with ease. The grip is comfortable, even for long prepping sessions, and the blades stay sharp, handling heavy-duty tasks like a pro. Cleaning is a breeze too—just pop them apart for a quick rinse. They’ve truly replaced a lot of extra gadgets in my kitchen drawer. If you want a versatile and durable pair of scissors, these are a must-have!",5
"These kitchen shears are a huge improvement over our last pair of Pampered Chef scissors from over 15 years ago. They're comfortable in hand, nice and tight, and sharp while not letting the food slip away from being cut. The blade cover is sturdy and snaps securely in place over the pivot for when you're not using the shears.",5
Very sharp and work well,5
"The KitchenAid All Purpose Kitchen Shears are an absolute must-have for every kitchen. These shears are incredibly, versatile and solidly built. The sharp edges make cutting poultry a breeze since I’m mainly using them to cut trim unwanted chicken fats and cubing them for stir fry.Cleanup is effortless and I just use soap and hot water and they come out looking like new every time.",5
"Bought these to replace the Fiesta ones in my knife block. These are sharp and made well. Have used them for months and they are still as sharp as when I got them. They are comfortable and easy to use, even for a left handed cook! No rust from the many washings either.",5
I've had this model for over a decade. It's great. Holds up. And I put it in the dishwasher probably 3-5 times a week and it doesn't rust and continues to function as expected. highly recommend.,5
"Great product from Kitchenaid, delivered ahead of schedule and in excellent condition.",5
"I have been ordering these for years! Great quality! They say you get what you pay for with trash bags, but these are a great buy. Scent free. They fit my standard kitchen trash can perfectly.",5
"Great in cost, and the drawstrings are very sturdy and easy to use. Fits our trash can perfectly.",5
"I have repeatedly bought these bags. They last a long time (the box). The bags hold a decent amount , definitely a sound purchase.",5
"I love these bags. They are sturdy and easy to open. I like the idea that there are 4 rolls in the box. White, no sent and very stretchy. Great price!",5
Great bang for your buck! I’ve been using this brand for years at home and my place of work. They’re amazing! Great quality!,5
These are the most durable and reliable trash bags. My husband and I have been ordering them for a few years now and will never use another trash bag. So great for the price and almost impossible to break.,5
"Good enough bags. I bought on sale thinking they are bags, kind of hard to screw up, and if they are bad well, they were cheap. This is good logic and I am glad we went with it. We have already purchased a second set. No leaking, no tearing. No regerts. They are bags and they work as advertised. Will likely continue to buy.",5
"We fill this with ice and the beverages of the event and set it on the counter. Looks nice and inviting to have glistening ice cold beer, soda or water ready for the taking rather than digging in a cooler. We’ve also used it for a few bottles of wine with glasses at the ready. Very happy with it.",5
"I bought the Twine Rustic Farmhouse Galvanized Beverage Tub for my Christmas Eve Party, and it was an absolute hit! Not only does it look gorgeous with my Christmas Decor, but it’s also super functional.",5
"The handles are very sturdy. The size of this is great. Do be aware that condensation does happen. I love this tin and use it as storage, but have used it to hold ice and drinks when hosting friends. It works great both ways I use it. I love how the twine does not start unwinding like other ones I have had. I would recommend this to anyone!!",5
These are great when entertaining and needing somewhere to keep your beverages cool.,5
The ice melted pretty fast but it didn't leak and it looks nice . Would buy again.,5
"I bought this to make a going away basket for a coworker. I was able to fit quite a bit of gifts! Although lightweight, it was very sturdy and did the job!",5
"This thing is so easy to use! My little 14yr girl was baking COOKIES like how we dreamed of as a kid. Remember those toy oven on TV?Plug it in,place parchment paper on the baking pan,add premade cookies cubes 2” apart,place pan on the “Bake” line,Set oven to “Bake”,Set Temp,Set Time,Press Start/StopWatch magic happens!Remove cookies when golden brownBoom! Good memories!I did have the wattage meter to check the status. On idle it’s 0.2W. On bake it’s ~1,300-1,500W (same as a bedroom space heater). This thing is pretty cool. Toast really well. Got it on sale at $150 during the Amazon Day once a quarter of something. Has been on my wish list for a bit until recently. This thing with right out of the box. Relatively minimal noise level. Can replace the oven, air fryer, and toaster to reduce Valuable countertop real estate. The oven is basically another storage cabinet. Definitely recommend!",5
"I've never owned a toaster oven before and this one has worked very well for my family. It's very versatile as I have used it for an air fryer, rotisserie and roasting so far. I haven't tried dehydration yet but will. This thing doesn't generate a lot of heat so my kitchen doesn't get to hot. It has been easy to clean. Even though it cooks food quick, I am still able to smell the food around the house. I only wish there was a storage drawer for all the pieces that come with it.",5
"It heats up quickly, maintains correct temperatures, is easy to use & keep clean.",5
"The media could not be loaded. My Instant Vortex died just short of 4 years. I opened it up and reset the thermal ""fuse"". It worked but only for about a minute, giving me the E1 error code. Time for an upgrade. The non-stick trays are also in a sorry state.This upgrade is worth it if only for the exterior stainless steel and the cute French door. Air fryers that open the door down always bugged me. Why can't they have a door like the microwave? Everything drips on the door hinge and the door. I had to get another tray to put on top of the opened door as another drip tray. But when I detached the door of the Instant Vortex, there wasn't much grease dirt accumulated there.The door isn't just cute but fully functional. You can open it with one hand, doesn't matter if you are left or right-handed. You need a little bit of clearance on the sides for it to stay open because it's spring-operated.The interface and buttons are superior. There are only 6 buttons including start and cancel. Others control what the dial is used for, setting time, temperature, cooking mode, etc. The buttons are quality sensor buttons with no moving parts. The rubbery membrane buttons are always the first thing to go in any appliance. The little display manages to tell you if you have a preheat mode and where to put your trays.The basket and rack are quality stainless steel. A short time will tell if they are not. The trays look like aluminum which most baking trays are made of. The grill plate is solid steel with ceramic coating. Many will not buy telfon like non-stick utensils. Many will not buy stainless steel utensils. I'm going for all stainless steel in the kitchen. They are easily cleaned by boiling in water with some washing soda. It's effortless to maintain even a mirror finish.Even the tray handle makes a lot of sense. You don't have one for the Instant Vortex. The rotating mechanism is also all metal.My only hesitation is that it doesn't have a rotating basket. My last use of the Instant Vortes was to roast peanuts, overheating in the process. Since this fryer is much bigger, you can spread the same amount of peanut on the flat basket in one layer. An air fryer is supposed to fry evenly.The Instant Vortex basket can be modified to fit the new host. Unscrew the black supporting blocks for the old rotisserie bars. All you need is a thick drill bit to grind off the rivet holding the old rotisserie bars, take them off, and enlarge the resulting hole a little. Screw the supporting blocks back. The new rotisserie can be put through the holed at the two ends.",5
"This thing can literally do everything... even ""hardboil"" eggs! I purchased specifically for the air frying and because a frozen pizza can be easily cooked in it, but I am amazed by everything that it can do - and how well it does it! The pizzas turn out great and it's easy for even my teenagers to use it when they get hungry. While it can fit a full frozen pizza, I don't feel like it takes as much counter space as some other comparable units (Looking at you, Breville). It's easy to clean. I usually just line the bottom tray of the unit with aluminum foil to make it lickety split. Really glad that I purchased it - it does make dinner a breeze and saves me from having to turn on and heat up a big oven if I'm just feeding myself.",5
"I have fallen in love with this thing! You can hear the fan it turns off once cooled down, the beeping is loud but appreciated. It's so easy to use and very versatile. I say it's worth the cost.",5
"Recently my range/stove had broken. Instead of replacing it, I opted to replace it with this oven. This oven works perfectly! It does what it says and more. The air fryer is wonderful for those frozen items and potatoes and the rotisserie works a treat. I’ve used it for baking as well, though I have had adjust cooking times. It will overcook if I follow the instructions on the packet. It is easy to clean and looks aesthetically pleasing in my kitchen. Highly recommend.",5
"Over the years I had several air fryers/ovens/toasters including a Kalorik none of them can measure up with the Emeril Lagasse air fryer 360. Precise temperature on all fonctions, easy to use and clean.We just love this oven which is larger than most.Great purchase!!",5
"I had a slightly smaller model of a different brand that had a plastic outside case and door and it broke into pieces and the door feel off from poor quality plastic.This is all metal and glass except for small non structural pieces on the handle.The only downside is the door can get a bit hot from being made of metal. Be careful not to burn yourself. I think it will last longer as a result though. And it works great.My model came with the grilling plate and I love it.The drip tray is removable and catches crumbs well, but to help keep the inside clean for many types of cooking, I also recommend getting third party stainless steel 12.5x9.5 inch baking pans that come with raised baking grills. It will let the air fryer circulate while catching more significant amounts of sauce and greasy drips.",5
Awesome product…… cooks amazing,5
"Good quality, warm, and soft",5
"The measurements in the listing are very accurate. However, you should check your measurements to the measurements in the listing. The pics will have you thinking this will drape the floor. On a twin the sides hang down about 12-1/2"" and 25"" at the foot with this laying flat on the mattress. It is all about personal preference. Depending on bed size, height, and other factors I have gone up or down a size.This is a great quilt with the look of a bedspread.It is very soft and comfortable and I slept under it all the way through the past couple of nights, something I rarely do.I washed and dried it according to the care instructions and it held up just fine with no shrinkage or wrinkles after immediately taking it out of the drier.Great product. Great value.",5
"I recently requested the Velvet King / Cal King Size, Black Quilt Set, and it has truly transformed my bedroom. The dual-sided velvet is incredibly soft and adds a touch of elegance to the room. The heavyweight feel of the quilt provides warmth and comfort, making it perfect for chilly nights.The box-stitched design not only looks stylish but also ensures that the down-alternative fill stays in place, providing consistent comfort. I appreciate that the set is machine washable, which makes it easy to keep clean and fresh.One of the standout features is the rich black color, which adds a sophisticated touch to my decor. The quilt and matching pillow shams are well-made and durable, promising to last through many washes without losing their softness.Overall, this quilt set is a fantastic addition to any bedroom. It's perfect for anyone looking to add a touch of luxury and comfort to their home. Highly recommend!",5
"This Great Bay Home velvet quilt set in navy is a dream come true for anyone who loves a touch of luxury with their comfort! Right away, I could feel the ultra-soft velvet material—it’s incredibly cozy and has a nice, comforting weight that makes it perfect for cold nights. The dual-sided velvet feels extra plush and indulgent, so no matter which side I’m snuggled under, it’s like being wrapped in a cloud.The heavyweight, down-alternative fill is another plus, providing warmth without overheating. The box-stitching is not only elegant but also keeps the fill evenly distributed, so there are no cold spots or clumping. The navy color is rich and deep, adding a sophisticated look to my room while remaining neutral enough to match various decor styles.For anyone looking to elevate their bedroom with a bedding set that’s as functional as it is luxurious, this quilt set is an absolute winner. It’s a perfect blend of style, comfort, and warmth—exactly what I wanted for a cozy night’s sleep!",5
"Wow, I'm so stoked about this quilt set!First, the color is a beautiful, bright brown. It almost has a slight gold sheen to it. It's also incredibly soft to the touch and the velvet is a fine, smoother velvet. It's great thickness, warm, and feels truly luxurious!",5
Love this Yankee candle! I think Yankee candles are the best as far as scent goes. This balsam and cedar candle reminds me of Christmas. It just makes me smile when I smell it. And Yankee candles last a long time too. I prefer jar candles because they are so much neater and do not drip. I’ve never had any glass breakage with one. Just be sure to trim the wick to a quarter inch every time you light it.,5
So I bought this because I thought it would smell like a christmas tree. To me it doesn't smell like a christmas tree but what I will say is that this is the first ever candle that to me smells like warmth and home. That was the only way I could think to describe it is warm. UPDATE so I decided today I was gonna just leave the lid off and since I have it smells more and more like christmas!,5
"Yankee candles are the best, but I hate their original jars. They look so dated, like they belong in Grandma’s house. The 22oz tumbler is a welcome change. The two-wick candle burns evenly across the top. To ensure this, on the first burn, allow the candle wax to liquify across the entire surface. Don’t extinguish it before that, otherwise you’ll never get an even burn.Trim wicks before each new burn & always burn long enough to liquify the entire surface. You’ll never have puddle burns, again.The fragrance of this candle is like a nice forest of fresh fir trees. 🌲 It’s not too strong, but just right.This candle is unbeatable for the Christmas season.",5
Smells amazing. I love that they burn slow and are not over powering. Yankee candles are the best!,5
"This is a true Yankee Candle! It's just as advertised and the smell is very nice... Pleasant, calming.Would definitely buy again. The price was a bargain!",5
"For me, this is the best candle there is. Yankee Candle always delivers on scent, and this festive candle just always makes me think of Christmas and wintertime. It has a nice long burn time, and I will always get one of these for the season.",5
Very nice fragrance that you can smell long burning,5
"I love candles and tried a lot but Yankees candles are the best . They smell great, and last long without any lighting problems.",5
Scent is just right - received within timeframe given,5
Aromas of Yankee candles are awesome 😎 and the enlarge candles smell good 😊,5
"These lights are AMAZING. The Govee app has plenty of preset lighting options/ colors but you can also customize your own. I have two sets and they are EXTREMELY bright for what they are. Definitely help lighting my living room. My only gripe is the adhesive tape they include to mount these panels to the wall leave much to be desired. I’ve had about three panels fall off and had to replace the adhesive. Overall not a big deal. Very happy with my purchase, I only wish I could buy more!",5
Really neat and easy to install. It feels solid and you really do have to put some pressure on the center. I found that once they stick decently I could pull them off and press further on the center for good measure. Overall it looks great and Installation was super easy. I love how adjustable the colors are on a whim. Totally worth everything and fun to play around with. The App was also easy to install and updated the profile to whatever layout you pick.,5
"lets start, these lights are very pretty and ate pretty decent sized. I used all 10 lights and they are very bright and the app is simple. DONT HESITATE TO BUY THEM. Although it did take a bit to install it was definitely worth it.",5
"I cannot stress this enough. Please do yourself a favor and watch the instructional video before you attempt to assemble them lol. These lights are better than the nanoleaf lights I bought prior, I can light each panel a separate color and the app made designing a layout a breeze. My only complaint would be the panels are a bit too tight in the wall mount, so it pulled the adhesive right off the wall (along with some paint and a portion of the drywall). This, of course, could have been avoided if I had taken my own advice and watched the instructional video before assembling. The panels are slightly smaller than the nanoleaf brand, so I was able to fit a bigger design on my small space that I wasn't able to do with the nanoleaf panels.",5
"***UPDATE: I was blown away by the Govee customer support after reaching out to them explaining the issue. They were extremely quick to respond (within about an hour) to my inquiry and immediately took steps to rectify my problem. They sent me a replacement that arrived in less than 48 hours, and the adhesive on this batch seems much better after setting them up. I was extremely impressed with the customer service and as I stated in my original review, the actual lights are beautiful. This has made me confident to continue purchasing and recommending Govee's products to friends and family.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I hate to write this review, as I love all of my other Govee products, but this really was a disappointing purchase. I have bought near $1000 of Govee lights over the past couple months and this is the first one that really was a terrible experience.As for the lights themselves, they are absolutely gorgeous. And the actual instructions for setup were fairly easy so no problems there. But oh god, the adhesion I would give a 0/10 if I could. I spent about an hour perfectly planning out my design, measuring for perfect placement, and very meticulously leveling each light panel as I followed the instructions on sticking them to the wall. In the morning I carefully cleaned the wall with isopropyl alcohol just to make sure there was no residue on the walls, then in the evening when it was time to actually install the hexa lights, I followed the instructions and wiped the wall with a dry cloth and then for each light I applied pressure for 60 seconds just to be safe. As I finished getting all the panels up and calibrated, one of the hex lights came unstuck. I wiped the wall again where that specific one fell off, reattached it, and went to sleep. Overnight, 2 of the 10 lights fell off the wall and were disconnected. 3 of the remaining 8 on the wall were not attached, but were just hanging from the support of some of the other lights.This whole installation has been a disaster from the start and has been an horrible user experience, which is a shame because the light quality for these themselves are great. So now I have to make the decision if I need to go and pay out of pocket to buy a bunch of command strips and reinstall all of these completely over again, or I am going to return them. I still haven't decided, but I wanted to provide this as a warning to all others looking to purchase this particular light.",5
"The media could not be loaded. One of my favorite products, the size and quality is solid. The mounting and serting of your design is much simpler than what I saw through the videos. The configuration is pretty quick. Just have a cleR design on mind or lay them on the carpet and play around until you get the right configuration for you. The colors are super and the panels are Super Super bright. On the pictures and video they were set at less than 5% because otherwize the reflect of the light doesnt allow you to take a clear picture or video.My only call out is that you will have extra "" cable"" between each panel connection as expected so you can have wiggle room, however the panels aren't heavy and the adhesive is pretty averga so depsite that I did spent 30 second pressing each one, as requested in the instructions. However, after a day or two de bending extra cord hidden in the back and the ""average"" adhesive, does not held the hexagons in place. them very well so it end up adding an extra double sided tape so they could stick nicely.Love the quality, size, functionalities,and price its a great product! Go grab yours!",5
I've had these for over 2 years. Really happy with them. I have quite a bunch of Govee products and these (and the smart plugs) are probably my favourite! Assembly was easier than it seemed also. I recommend!,5
"PRO's: Absolutely awesome, so many different configurations and boy do they ever get bright,, so much so that I have to keep them turned down to 20% at the highest, mind you my whole room is full of different Govee lighting on every wall.Super easy to use from the app with so many different colour patterns to choose from who of course you can DIY and works with T1 and T2 display systems, are RGBIC so you can get pure white out of them up to 6500 K or down to around 3000 I believe.Super easy doing install and comes with many suggestions on patterns or of course you can choose your own, so many options with the assignable LEDs inside each hex, let alone the combination of them working in harmony. Great value as they often go on sale for 40% off or so and are much better value than Phillips lighting without trading off any quality, in fact in my opinion it's superior in most cases.CON's: (TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE)",5
"Take your time, do the design on the floor before you tape to the wall. Measure 3 xs to make sure you get it right. The apps is awesone. Easy to understand. Like anything if you have experiance with electronics you will be fine. If your a NOOB just take your time and you will succeed.I purchased a grey cover from amazon to hide the white cord.Its VERY bright when you turn it up. I will light up the room for sure.Works with google home no probs.You have UNLIMITED designs, just leave it to you imagination.",5
"I have to agree with other reviewers, the fragrance and the strength of the smell is just about perfect for what I need. I placed this on my entryway bench and when you sit to put on shoes or you're getting the dogs collars and leashes ready, it gives off a pleasant smell. But it's not so strong that I smell it all the time or can't burn a candle in the living room without the smells competing. I will likely purchase another one, maybe 2, for other small spaces in the house. Great value, too, since you get the extra fragrance bottle.",5
"Beautiful item that is appealing not only to the eye, but fills a large room with a fresh, light, yet masculine scent that smells almost seductive. The glass jar comes pre filled, yet also includes a large bottle for refills. My entire family has complimented the scent, in a room that usually has an odor of dogs (being my two large dogs sleep in our bedroom). It is strong, yet not overpowering. I cannot image I will get tired of the scent as it is that good. 10/10- will be purchasing again!",5
Smells great and lasts long,5
I'll order again next time,5
"This Gonjahon Reed Diffuser Set is a pleasant-smelling reed diffuser with a whole lot of essential oil. There is a main glass bottle which apparently has about 112ml of essential oil and a plastic refill bottle with 200ml more for a total of 10.55 fluid ounces of essential oil. The sales listing mentions the essential oil should last about 120 days or 4 months. And the set comes with 10 black reeds or “rattan diffusion bars.” The smell reminds me of a gentle cologne which apparently is labeled as “early morning.”There is not much for instructions. The box shows removing the reeds and flipping them apparently every 48hours. But beyond that, there is nothing more except for a lot of Chinese Kanji.This is a good essential reed diffuser set. And the glass bottle is elegant enough to place out in the open for guests to admire. As to whether this would turn out to be your favorite fragrance, that is hard to predict since everyone’s taste is different. But it is a gentle, pleasant scent that most people would likely enjoy.",5
"I recently installed the BAYKA Floating Shelves in my guest bathroom, and they’ve been a game-changer! Here’s why:Perfect for Small SpacesSince my bathroom doesn't have cabinets, I needed a way to store extra toilet paper and other bathroom essentials. These shelves are ideal! They fit perfectly on the wall without taking up too much space, and they gave me the extra storage I was looking for without overcrowding the room.Great Rustic LookThe rustic wood finish on these shelves looks fantastic. It adds a warm, charming touch to the bathroom, which is exactly what I wanted. The natural wood grain blends really well with my bathroom’s decor, making it feel cozy and stylish.Easy to InstallInstalling these shelves was super easy. The instructions were clear, and it only took about 15 minutes to get them up on the wall. The mounting hardware was included, so I didn’t need anything extra, and they’re securely attached now.Sturdy and FunctionalDespite their sleek design, these shelves are really sturdy. I’ve got toilet paper, hand towels, and some decorative items on them, and they’re holding everything just fine. No wobbling or issues with weight at all.Great ValueFor the price, these shelves are a steal. They look more expensive than they are and add so much character to the space. Plus, they’ve freed up some much-needed counter space in the bathroom.Overall, I’m really happy with the BAYKA Floating Shelves. They’re stylish, practical, and easy to install—perfect for adding storage to small spaces. If you need some extra room in your bathroom or any other room, I highly recommend these!",5
These are made of good quality material. They were easy to install. Look great and the finish was nice. Yes I would buy these again.,5
Exactly as advertised. Very easy to install and the shelves come with everything you need to hang them. ( screws and anchors) They look very nice on the wall.,5
"My room is really small so I needed a way to make space and make it look clean. I have a ton of books so I decided to get these floating shelves and it looks so beautiful! I really love the shelves. My dad did help me install them. You definitely need a measuring tape, a drill, and some patience. It wasn’t the super easiest to install but it wasn’t bad either. Worth the money for sure",5
"Thanks to the reviews here, I purchased metal plaster anchors to install. Much sturdier. This is easy to install. Get yourself some metal anchors first. Amazon sells them too.",5
Love this candle warmer! Its a great size and works so well. Very attractive design that could look good in any room in the house and works with several decor styles. I like that it has a timer and the light does radiate a nice glow. It does have an adjustable pole to accomodate candle height.,5
"I first encountered one of these at a boutique and so glad I did! It is attractively made and works so well with any type of jar candle. It also makes a great night light and as an added bonus emits a great smell from the candle. No more worries about starting a fire! I have given these as gifts and received so many thank-yous! That speaks volumes about the product, that's for sure!",5
The glass lampshade is vey pretty and the lamp seems to be well constructed. The light bulb melts the candles quickly. The timer is a nice safety feature.,5
"We absolutely LOVE this candle warmer that we got for our housewarming present! It's so much safer than burning candles and in my opinion, the scent stays longer and steadier than a live flame. And while it might not be as cozy as a flickering flame, it is so much safer for our home. We have a child who always has friends over, and the candle is always a concern - we don't want kids burning themselves, and now we don't have to worry about it. The candle warmer escapes notice. I did notice this size of candle warmer works best with single wick candles or smaller candles - I think I would need a bigger one for three wick candles, but that's fine. I think this also helps the candle last longer as well!",5
"Works like a charm. This adjustable lamp makes it easy to adjust for different size candles. While it works for fragrance, it also has ample brightness needed in the area just like a candle. I like the option to control brightness, which you can’t really do with a simple candle.",5
"I adore this candle warmer! I was looking for a way to help reduce some unpleasant scents in my office at work (joys of being located near a loading dock in a large city) and I didn’t feel comfortable with an open flame because I often have to leave my office to address issues in other departments. I love that this gives me a safe way to use my candle stash and that it does so in such a pretty way! People stop in to comment on the great smell from the candles it melts and ask me where I got this great little lamp. I also love the timer feature because if I forget to turn it off before I leave for the night, I know it will shut off on its own!I love that this lamp has an adjustable height to work with any size candle and that it helps my candles last longer than traditional burning! 10/10 on all fronts!",5
Just as pictured! Works very well and it’s nice you get an extra light bulb. The timer setting is amazing! Very happy with my purchase.,5
"These shower racks are sturdy, the construction wire is thick! The racks are so spacious I was able to use them for 2 showers. They were easy to put them up and the adhesive is so strong. My showers walls are fiberglass.",5
"We ordered these a few month back for our standing shower. I was expecting to have to anchor these to the tiles with screws, but the adhesive backing is far stronger than i ever expected. The clips are mounted to a singular plate that fits behind the baskets and really provides support. Due to the design, the clips all contact the baskets evenly and spread the weight all the way across. It took longer to prep the surface than it did to install the baskets. Start to finish install was under 5 min total and they have held up perfectly.",5
"These are wonderful. It was super easy to install, didn't break the bank, they look wonderful. I love how it's not suction cups! The adhesive sticks super well!! I have those bulk giant bottles, they fit perfectly and nothing has fallen, kids haven't torn them down. I'm very happy with this purchase! Follow directions, clean your walls, once it sticks.... It's not moving so be careful. Great value!",5
"I love these ""shelves"" so much I bought 2 more! I have them in both of our showers and bought the 3rd for my parents' shower! The finish (black) looks great. Easy to install - just have to be able to wait 24 hrs to put the shelves on. They hold quite a bit and dont feel like they will fall off the tiles. I am using the one thats supposed to be for toothbrushes?? for my combs, etc in the shower and it works out so well. I definitely give this a 2 thumbs up!!!",5
"The only negative I have is, if you've got an apartment sized tub/shower these might be too wide and you'll end up bumping into them with elbows or any body part that's aligned with where you've installed them. However, that's not a design flaw, therefore I didn't take away any stars. They seem to be very sturdy and has great stickiness (I did thoroughly clean the shower walls, rinsed them well, then wiped the areas I was placing the hangers with alcohol. Then I heated the hangers with my blow dryer, used a butter knife to make sure I got around every edge. Then I waited a full 24+ hours to attach the baskets and put items in them. I have huge salon sized shampoo and conditioner bottles with pumps that withhold their weight and me pumping to get the product. I really REALLY want to love these, but having to contort my body every shower is annoying. I will see if they have replacement sticky adhesives and if changing positions would work (shower walls have 2 ""seams"" that stick out, so I don't have unlimited space).",5
"We just renovated our tub/shower surround and it didn't come with shelves, so we needed a solution - hence this purchase. I used a level and frog tape to get these exactly where I wanted them, then lifted the clear panel up and carefully removed the backing, keeping the frog tape on as a guide. Pressed down firmly, then let the adhesive cure overnight before putting the shelves up. It feels like these aren't going anywhere. The install was so easy and perfect. They hold a ton of weight and feel very sturdy. The instructions say warranty is 2 years, so that's encouraging! I will report back if they fail.",5
"These shelves are great. Very study, attractive and the adhesive WORKS! Nice storage, easy to install. Very pleased with product and worth the cost which was very reasonable.",5
"Batteries included, how great is that. I set the timer and they come on automatically every evening. Made very sturdy and easy to use. The flickering lights are very real looking. They are perfect.",5
"These flameless candles are a fantastic addition to any home! They offer the ambiance of real candles without the worry of an open flame, making them perfect for households with children or pets, or for anyone who wants to enjoy candlelight without the fire hazard. The flickering flame effect is incredibly convincing, mimicking the gentle dance of a real candle flame. This creates a warm and inviting atmosphere. They are made of real wax which enhances the realistic look and feel. The timer function adds convenience, allowing you to set the candles to turn on and off automatically at your preferred times. The remote control makes it easy to operate them from a distance, even across the room. No more worries about accidentally knocking over a candle or leaving it unattended. These flameless candles offer the perfect blend of beauty, functionality, and peace of mind. Highly reccomended!",5
"Luminara candles are the best ever. The flickering flame is so realistic! - More than any other I've purchased. It creates the best ambiance, especially during the fall/winter/Christmas season. The battery life is good, the remote control works great. The only negative is the price. 🫤 I wish they weren't SO expensive. Because of that, I hesitated getting them. But -I'm glad I did!",5
I love the Luminaire real flame candle trio and it includes a ready to use remote. A beautiful burgundy color great for any season or occasion. A great value and excellent quality.,5
"These are terrific, look like real candles. The outside is real wax. Working perfectly. I use them every night. I have two sets of three, total of six. Great for the living room. I can operate all six from one remote control.",5
"I’ve wanted to buy these candles for a long time. They were pricey, but they are lovely.I wish I would have bought them years ago. They give off a beautiful flickering glow. The control makes it easy to turn on and off.",5
Love the remote and realistic flickering Beautiful addition to our room.,5
These lights emit a cozy light to any room,5
The perfect decor for the perfect fan. Three cute shadowboxes with baseball slogans-perfect,5
"These are well constructed and look very high-quality. We use these to decorate the cake table at my son’s sports themed birthday party. However, he has now commandeered them and has them as decorations in his room.",5
These signs are well made and very cute. The sayings are perfect for baseball season and have blended well with the other baseball themed decor that I have.,5
Such fun summer decor for my home!,5
"Ordered the baseball set. My 10 yo is having an amazing season on All-stars this summer. This is a small is size set of 3 nesting boxes. While they aren't huge and would awkward hanging on a wall, they will look super cute on a shelf, desk, or dresser. As he plays baseball all year long with Fall Ball, Sprink Ball, and now All-stars, these will be able to be displayed all year long.",5
"If your a child of the 80’s-90’s “You’re killing me smalls” was a part of your vocabulary and might still be. When I saw these, I just couldn’t resist! Will pair perfectly with 4th if July decor and make me smile whenever I see it.",5
"These are the perfect little decorations For summer. It’ll work for Memorial Day, during Fourth of July and carry me through the summer. They are made really well and stagger in sizes. The print is adorable and printed on clearly. Totally worth the values.",5
Perfect for my front door the magnets stay on great nice and light weight but great quality and there are so many changeable attachments for all the seasons and holidays,5
Purchased this as a housewarming gift for our good friends and they loved it! I was honestly shocked at how good the quality of the sign and adorable different interchangeable holiday pieces it comes with. Literally couldn’t have exceeded my expectations more. It’s the perfect housewarming gift and a total steal for the price it’s set at. Could not recommend this adorable sign more!! Worth every penny!,5
So cute!!! Great quality! Perfect for our new home!,5
"Finally starting to get into our new place and finally being able to put up signs that we picked out and that are ours alone was a feeling we thought we'd brush over. Honestly it feels amazing to have a place that's ours. It does tend to wobble but it doesn't really fall off if you secure it right, the pieces stay on and everything, lovely signage!",5
"I love it the fact that I can switch the welcome sign according to the season! Not sure if its a good size for the main entrance door, I use it on the side door near my car garage which is the door that we use the most. great quality and get a lot of compliments.",5
"This was super cute! The quality was good. It was lightweight and looked nice. The greenery at the top was a little sparse and looked a tad fake but overall it was a great value for the cost, and from the front door it doesn’t look fake/bad a distance. The changeable pieces are cute and there are a variety of holiday options as well!",5
Looks very nice,5
"Colorful, good quality stones. When opened looks beautiful, perfect size to fit any where. Adds beauty, and tranquility to any room.",5
"I received a handcrafted Tree of Life for as a gift from my son. I am very impressed with the colors and meaningful thought put behind this tree. I was also very impressed to receive a card from Neha (who made this beautiful tree). Neha is from Rajkot (India) and tells a bit about herself as well as her children and goals. Not only did I receive a very unique gift, but the proceeds are helping those striving to make a better life for themselves and their family.",5
"I’ve been wanting one of these for a while. I love the size it’s perfect, it’s small and this fits in my decor. The stones are a beautiful color and I love the personal note that was attached with my purchase.",5
My boyfriend got me this as a gift and it is super cute. the bottom is heavy enough to it stand its ground. it was really easy and almost therapeutic spreading the branches apart,5
I gave this to my wife for her birthday and she absolutely loves it!! Excellent hand made quality!!,5
Just as described. Fits well on my wall unit,5
"Beautiful, good quality, arrived very quickly.",5
"Very nice tree of life. It has helped me in various situations like health, money, harmony. I believe in that and the tree is beautiful.",5
put them around the house,5
"I couldn't be happier with this adorable turtle statue! It adds the perfect touch of charm to my garden. The design is incredibly detailed, and the succulent on its back looks so realistic.

It's solar-powered, so it's completely hassle-free—just set it up and enjoy! This tortoise statue makes a fantastic gift idea or a lovely addition to any outdoor space. Highly recommend!",5

This looks beautiful in my yard. Works great at night with solar charging and has a strong built for cold weather. Very lightweight and good priced.,5

This turtle garden decoration is super cute! I love it!,5

"***There Was No Compensation For This Review******EDITED REVIEW**I've officially owned this machine for over 2 months now. All I can say is WOW. The negativity following this machine makes me wonder if these are other issues that could be causing problems versus the machine.. I read a review *Top Critic* and it sounds more of an internet connection issue versus the machine. The capability of this machine has been amazing. I use this machine now mainly for gaming/fun. I have 3 monitors with peripherals setup (mouse, keyboard, microphone, headset), and have no issues with connectivity or software issues. The machine can handle me streaming on two different platforms and in the same action playing a high demanding game on ULTRA settings and a recording software going at the same time. My GPU is still only around 70-80% and the CPU is running amazing. The cooling of this machine is great and have not had 1 issue since purchase. I would take the critic/negativity reviews carefully.. Don't let those scare you away.. You COULD end up with possibly something wrong but that could've also been from shipping or anything.. If you're looking for a budget PC that can perform very well, than I HIGHLY recommend this PC. Hope this helps!----------------------------------------------------------------Original review belowTo start off, this is a review on the item:Manufacturer Part#: ST-NEBULA-0819-B-AMProcessor: INTEL Core i5 13400F 2.5 GHz (4.6GHz Max Boost) CPUMemory: 16GB DDR4 RAM 3200 Gaming Memory with Heat SpreaderVideo Card: NVIDIA Geforce RTX 4060 8GB GDDR6X Graphics Card (Brand may vary)SSD: 1TB NVME SSDOperating System: Microsoft windows 11 Home 64-bitCase: Skytech Nebula Gaming Case, BlackWiFi: 802.11ACFans: 4 RGB Fans for Maximum Air FlowThis PC so far has been great for gaming as well as working from home. The functionality right out of the box has been great and it has been a breeze to get setup. The PC has a folder that comes with it and it shows the step by step guide on how to setup your machine as well as how to troubleshoot if need be. There are many Pro's and few Con's so far since I have owned the Machine.Pros:Packaging for shipping was over the top on making sure it was coming to me securely,Comes as described with little setup needed,Performance has been stellar,Quiet Machine and fans,Case has great airflow,Quality of the product is over the top for the price of this machine.Operates many games on ULTRA settings with 0 issues.Cons:The machine comes with 16gb of DDR4 ram installed and this is a great starter amount but for full potential I would recommend upgrading to the minimum of 32gb of DDR4 or higher.(I upgraded to 32gb DDR4 3200mhz with the 4 available slots)One of the Ram sticks seemed to be not fully clipped into position but took minor adjustment to get setup.The rear fan was loose and rubbing against the case which had a small clicking noise but was an easy fix.Trouble connecting the DisplayPort to a Monitor after trying multiple cords, but HDMI does work well.Cord management inside could be much better, the cables seem to block some of the ports for the RAM and would recommend using some zip-ties to hold them out of the way.Games:GTA-V - Runs at highest settings with 0 issues and high FPSFortnite - Runs at highest settings with 0 issues and high FPSBattlefield 2042 - Runs at highest settings with 0 issues and high FPSWar Thunder - Runs at highest settings with 0 issues and high FPSMinecraft - Runs at highest settings with 0 issues and high FPSCan handle many applications open on multiple monitors when working from home such as, Tableau, Excel, Zoom, Teams, Talend, PowerPoint, Multiple query applications (Coding with no issues), Video editing, Streaming.The PC at the price point is worth the purchase, after doing many researches without wanting to build my own PC this was the best Pre-Built machine money can find. Many have i5-13400F processors with 3060's or lower processors with similar 4060/3060's for more cost. At $850 USD this machine will tackle most of what you will need to do unless you're into heavy editing or a big streamer or using extreme applications. This PC is great for overall use.",5
"Ordered this PC from a store called MXC tech because it was on sale it turned out that place was a scam (MAKE SURE TO ORDER IF IT IS SHIPPED AND SOLD BY AMAZON.COM)Been using a decently old laptop GTX 1650 and I5 12450H reason I bought this was because someone broke my main. The jump from those computers to this is actually incredible I’ve never had a computer with an RTX Series card.To the main lighting, when pressing the RGB button it will download the program all RGB in the case is customizable and bright. The size is pretty small the width is a little chunky not going to like but overall smallish pc. Do not let the size fool you it’s powerful I’ve played 3 games on it so far I will give my FPS and stats during using itFortnite - epic settings direct x12 I was running about 60-70 FPS it had a few stutters but that is normal I would say.Went to performance mode on all medium settings ran a constant 238-240 FPS kn the ground while deploying from the battle bus it stuttered a little at the start then eased on, temps never went over 60°C on the GPU. I do keep my room quite cold so that can maybe affect it a little bit.Rainbow six siege - ran around 300 fps I capped it to 240 as it wasnt the most consistent when it was unlimited frames. Constant 999 FPS while in the menu lol.Roblox - anywhere from 140+ depending on the game using max graphics.The keyboard that came with it I didn’t use but it looked like some good build quality.Mouse that came with I didn’t try either.I had 0 issues so far with the computer booted right up I was worried but to my shock nothing went wrong this is my first day using it and it works super good.The value for this computer is really good the parts all together is around $850-$900 so it’s a steal.**Again I rebought this computer from shipped and sold by Amazon.com even if it looks like a good deal do not buy it.**Came with 3 display ports and 1 HDMI on the graphics card.No issue with startup it was simple and easy pressed a few buttons logged in and that was it.Overall this pc is a pretty good computer especially for its price I recommend buying it if you don’t want to break your wallet with prices of computers these days.",5
