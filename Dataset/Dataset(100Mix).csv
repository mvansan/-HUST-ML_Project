"The case was very nice for a week or two and then stretched so bad that my phones corners were constantly popping out of it. I had to pop the phone back into the case every time i took the phone out of my pocket. Also the more rubbery part of the case (the sides that stretched) yellowed a lot after just a couple of weeks of use. Could not return it to Amazon bc i didnt have the original box so I submitted a warranty claim on the Otterbox website. They asked for photos and said that my case might qualify for a replacement and i need to ship it back to them. They said that they couldn’t provide a shipping label but my shipping fee will be waived on their side. Liars. So i go and spend $30 on shipping it back, send them the receipt and they say they are not going to reimburse it now. Would not even give me a gift card for that amount. So i end up spending $80 on a bad quality product that i dont even have anymore. I ask them if they can at least send me a replacement in a different color so there is no yellowing problem to which they agree (they said they would make an “exception” for me). But then they ignore me for days. FedEx said that they received my package on Dec 9 but on Dec 19 Otterbox said that they dont have anything and they cannot track my package bc the tracking website didn’t work which of course it did. That was the last email I received from a human. On Dec 22 I received an automatically generated email that my package has been received (13 days after it actually arrived) and that was it. They have been ignoring my emails and not responding. $80 and a lot of my free time down the drain. I would not recommend doing business with them to anyone. I trusted their reputation and I should not have. This is the worst customer service experience i have ever had.",1
"This item looks good, the 2-in-1 separate filter line is useful, and installation was straightforward.Unfortunately after 18 months, the faucet started leaking from inside the metal housing. Even when the faucet was turned off, water would leak slowly from inside the housing, down the line, and dripped over a few days. It ended up ruining my cabinet and the drywall on the ceiling of the floor below.The manufacturer, Kraus, claims a ""lifetime limited warranty"", but within the warranty text, the faucet hardware is only covered from defects for 1 year and 5 years, with more limits. After 1 year, they will also charge you for shipping the defective item back to them.I understand that I should have read the warranty terms in more detail before purchasing the item. However, I didn't expect a kitchen faucet to fail within such a short time frame, given how expensive it was. I also take issue with companies that try extract shipping fees from their customers when their products are defective and under warranty.Since I wasn't interested in paying for shipping to have a defective item repaired, and no longer trusted the manufacturer, I asked about return options. The agent condescendingly answered, ""honey, we're the manufacturer, you'll have to call Amazon about that"" and abruptly ended the conversation.I understand that defective items will occur from time to time. However, I do expect that companies stand by their products and provide support for their customers when it happens. Unfortunately Kraus is not one of those companies and I had to go through Amazon to get help with this situation.I'm sure most people who have bought this product have a faucet that's working fine. However, in the off chance that you get a defective unit, just know that Kraus will not be helpful. You're better off buying from another company for the same price range.",1
The handles fell off the replacements,1
It’s not like the pictures. No metal thing to hang it on. Looks homemade.,1
"These candles were lovely until one totally died even after battery replacement. It won't work at all. These are way too expensive to only last 4 months. I turn them on about 3 times/week for an hour, not every day. Disappointing!",1
"Dollar stores have a better quality then this product, and 10 times cheaper.",1
Keyboard is cheap looks like a disco . Slow,1
POST beeps indicating corrupt bios. Returning.,1
"First boot, saw the windows logo, then BSOD. Couldn't get it to recover as it didn't have a recovery image installed. Couldn't boot safe mode, error stating couldn't install windows in safe mode. BSOD after BSOD after BSOD. Additionally, Amazon customer service was lacking in this experience.Returned for refund. Gotta love the new 30 days to refund on higher priced items like this. Maybe I can order one next month.",1
"ive had this pc for a good 3 and a half years already bout it to play games, but after realizing the hardware was 10+ years old i couldnt play nothing on it so i just used it for school work and ext. Out of the 3 and half years ive had it most of the time ive had it it was either not working at asurion getting fixed or on and not even being used cause itll crash every opportunity it gets. I really wished i refunded when i had the chance but i was to ignorant, after these 3 years ive seen plenty of videos on these pc scams and ext and you can get this exact same computer for a quarter of its price. dont get scammed just because it looks good and has LED lights this computer is literally useless. For 500$ you can find a computer wayy more advanced than this one and last way longer. im truly upset on this purchase its the worst of my life (i just got done paying it off)",1
"Several times it shut down with hardware erro4s and is not compatible with Windows 11. And I constantly have to unplug the keyboard and the mouse and plug them back in to get them to work. I have to do the same with my camera. The box looks great but what a crappy computer it is slower than DialUp they give you a little USB to plug into the computer to have Wi-Fi. It’s the same size as the USB square that comes out of your wireless mouse. What an awful experience from the very first week I bought this computer to the last right now. It is completely shut down I’m in the middle of a business everything I have is on this computer on the cloud to return which I don’t have access now , it’s just horrible . Look at the second picture behind my computer, you’ll notice that the only things that are plugged in are the monitors, keyboard and mouse. And if you look at the first picture, you’ll notice the errors card via storage device, such as an external USB drive, which we don’t have faulty hardware such as a hard drive or CD ROM, which apparently we do now just awful.",1
This computer was marketed as a new gaming computer and never worked at a level for gaming. After a year of trying to make it work we brought it to a professional and they said the components were 5-6 years old and we were better of buying a different computer vs trying to update/fix this one. Thanks for making a kids dream Christmas gift a complete lemon.,1
"This computer is garbage! Parts are from 2011. You'll spend more than what u bought it for to upgrade it to work for ur games! Do urself a favour, save ur money & DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER!",1
"I want a full refund of my money you can’t even use the internet without it lagging, can’t even load fortnite let alone play it got into one match with 4 fps with everything to the lowest I will not stop emailing until you have refunded me",1
"This PC was great to look at, and that's about it. The Wifi was terrible/damaged idk. We even used a third party wifi adapter and it was still awful. We have a 330mbs internet and all my other devices ran fast, so that wasn't the problem. Afterwards, it didn't detect my monitor. I ran it for a couple of minutes and nothing. It sounds like a jet engine while it's running as well. Over all, this PC is not worth the headache I went through. Save your money and look for another option.",1
"The monitor support bar didn't fit .. then once we rigged something together and set it up it kept restarting, wouldn't get past initial set up. DO BETTER !!!",1
The media could not be loaded. The pc and the monitor would not connect at all. The monitor would flash on and say no signal then turn off. The desktop itself from the moment of turning it on made that very loud motor boat sound. The advertised keyboard and mouse were not included a standard set was.I called support who advised they would try and connect me with a IT Person and that took over 30 mins. IT kept telling me to unplug it and plug it back in. Return support was not helpful either please don’t waste time or money on this!,1
Fine for the first few times that it was being used but now is laggy or completely shuts down. Only purchased in August of 2023 and it's now January 2024 so only had it for less than 5 months and it isn't even used heavily. Disappointing.,1
"product is very very bad packaged , LED not working with a very very very small electricity output cable . i literally had to get a power source 5CM beside it to make it fit and still LED not working",1
"This console was a brick the day it was released. As usual, Microsoft is years behind its competitors. I don’t even know why I was stupid enough to purchase one. The biggest issue is that in order to play games you purchased, you must constantly update them. That’s ridiculous. Why? It was working just fine. The other issue is that it continues to take up more and more space. I regret few things in life, but purchasing this junk has to be on the top. Save yourself some headache and buy a different system.",1
"I bought this ”refurbished” console in July, and it stopped turning on in November. This was sold as an “Amazon Refurbished” console. The customer support at Amazon told me they wouldn’t replace it, and they wouldn’t take a return on it. The “warranty is for 90 days,” and the console turned into a brick at 120 days, so there’s nothing that Amazon will do to stand behind their product. They told me to contact Microsoft for help. The warranty that Microsoft gives is from the original purchase date of the console. In my case the “Microsoft warranty” ended on Nov. 21st, and the console quit working on Nov. 25th. So lucky me the only thing I can do is pay Microsoft an additional $300 to get this console replaced. So because I’m one month outside of 90 days and 4 days past a warranty that started before I even owned the console I now own a $450 paper weight. And if I want the company to fix or replace it I get to own what will be a $750 console. All because I trusted Amazon to sell a working “refurbished” console.",1
I thought I’d give this a go seeing as it was Microsoft refurbished. Looked brand new when opened. Everything was great. Then while installing games and watching a movie it locked up. I rebooted and it would lock up then shut off. I reset it several times. Same issue. Safe to say the SSD failed. Spend the few extra dollars and buy new. Waste of time and money.,1
"Picked the referbished unit for the savings. Worth the price. Came with the full warranty. Controller looks new. Was the price of a used one on the local buy and sells, and has warranty. A no lose situation.Update, controller drift after 40 days. Amazon will not accept return and Microsoft will not warranty. DO NOT PURCHASE****",1
"I bought this as a gift and unfortunately was left extremely disappointed. The controller didn’t work, the console freezes during game play with almost every single game we tried and then one week later it will not turn on. Well, it turns on, but nothing will display on the TV other than the Xbox logo. Extremely disappointing and embarrassing given it was a gift. Seems that buying a new one may be worth the money if this is the best alternative. Returning asap and will be using the money toward a new console from a legitimate seller.",1
Product failed on second day. Returned!,1
"Package arrived early, which was nice, console turned on and worked fine, until it came to reading the discs. The console did not work any further than the home screen, super disappointing. And upon trying to clean the disc scanner, the console was customized so there is no access to this point of the hardware; a part allowing you to go further is missing and replaced with a custom piece that won’t move, meaning if it is broken, its broken. There’s no hope in repairing it yourself. Was looking forward to it but was let down",1
I understand this item was not going to be brand new. That said the quality is very poor. Rusted insides not refurbished at all. Does not power on. Oveall disappointed that they would even take someones money and be ok with sending this out.,1
"This phone was not usable on Straight Talk Wireless. Straight Talk informed me that the phone was locked and could not be used on their service until it was unlocked. This phone is listed as unlocked and usable on any service. I contacted Samsung because these are new phones, they had me do a factory reset on the phone and said that would fix the issue. This did nothing to fix the problem.",1
"UPDATE: After having this phone for months I have to say it's the biggest POS that I've ever had!! More glitches than I could list. I took 4 stars away because I'm so angry at all the glitches. Now I'm going to go back to my A10E, at least that was reliable!!I decided to wait to write a review because I was on the fence about keeping it or not. My previous phone was a Samsung A10E which is not a very heavy phone. The A15 is considerably heavier which I am (still) not very comfortable with. Comparing the 2 phones as far as memory is concerned is markedly different. The A10E has 32 gigs of internal memory. The A15 has 128 gigs of internal memory. Considering that I have alot of pics on my phone with several different albums, this makes the A15 a better product. The battery life is quite good. The appearance is beautiful. I purchased the light blue phone. I have a clear cover on my phone. This is my 4th Samsung cell phone. Samsung never disappoints with quality, durability and performance. I love the Samsung Smart Switch which makes moving your data from one phone to another fast and super easy. They don't provide a SIM card or micro SD card so you need to make sure to move your cards into your new phone. The software is similar to previous Samsung phone with a few tweaks. For example, to get a screen shot for the A15 you need to press both power and volume down button simultaneously. What makes the A15 different from any of my previous Samsungs is with the A15 you have to press each twice. There is a feature that would put a floating icon on your screen and open it and tap screenshot then you will get your screenshot. Now, what sold me on the A15 is a neat feature where, upon your approval, they will block all spam/scam phone calls. So no more annoying spam/scam calls!! It's a neat feature!! Like I said, I love Samsung phones!!",1
"How many apps do you think you have on your phone? 40? 50? how about your phone from 2 or 3 years ago? 15-20 tops? LOL ah, yes the days when we got excited to get a few free apps or games on our new phones... alas those days are OVER bro! get you a variation of the moto g device family. Out of the box, she is pretty amazing. I didn't have a single complaint really. Super fast, tons of storage, great camera, new updated apps, lots of customizing, etc. JUST WONDERFUL. After a few months it happened, the dreaded update in April I think it was, maybe March, I now have 400+ apps. (I will attach a pic, it shows 399, there have been about 30-40 more that have trickled in since the initial dump, which took about 5-7 days to finish up... and 75-80% are ""system apps"" (bloatware from any and every carrier in fact.... ALL. OF. THEM.) For example, a bluetooth app for t-mobile, & verizon, & sprint, & metro, && cricket. Before you say, ""just uninstall them and move on!"" - I did. I have. I've factory reset twice and they're just BUILT INTO THE phones disk memory. There simply is no ""delete"" them. Some of them, as duplicatory as they are, messing around with them can still brick up your jawn within a few clicks... and before you even start, you are not a dev... so chill, I mean neither am I... but you just stay out of that menu, that app, and that folder. Really, who knows why they name everything in tech sketchy stuff like ""com.sys.IM-WATCHING-YOU-PAM.000"" and ""<%real/secret/23-LISTENER999>... but anyways... JUST PROMISE ME, YOU WON'T GET INTO THAT APP, OR FOLDER.... okay?So Motorola should reimburse me for having to put myself through IT school to teach myself to operate on this phones guts and remove all these garbage apps manually to create the phone I thought I purchased. All you can do is force stop and disable them. Buuut I still feel like they are gathering data, bc, why wound't they be. Its not just this model either, my partner has the moto g stylus 5g and its even worse on theirs. the play store basically never gets a break from constant updates (and then theres the transferring of precious data to the mother ship)yeaaaa we also had to upgrade our home internet plan and router because of all this. We couldn't both use the wifi at the same time doing anything at all. it was crazy. allllllso the apps are gathering intense amounts of data and ALL WANT crazy permissions that have nothing to do with the app itself. like the calculator wants camera permissions... nuts. The sheer number of apps that require making system changes or having total device control... it was too much. I would almost ask for a refund, but from what I see these days most phones are leaning that direction, making money off our god given ones and zeros.... and then still try and look at us in the eyes while they sputter out the retail price of the next generation of your favorite device. can't even hold it down on a free case or something..THEN - - when you finally get a break from force quitting and removing permissions that, somehow keep TURNING BACK on... you might have a few minutes to enjoy a quick photoshoot. NOPE. the camera app it comes with stinks, it just soooo basic.. so then you think, oh, i'll download a cool camera app off play store... NOPE. theres a fricking governor on the camera. That makes it so NO 3rd party camera app will get full usage of ALL THE MEGA PIXELS YOU PAID YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY FOR (48 megs to be precise, which is overkill, but still, you will be lucky to get to use 10 or 12 MP!!)Seriously. And JUST as google starts conveniently implementing the awesome 2 step verification, and authentication keys.... JUST in time for you to have to answer to your wife about why you don't have as much info in your google takeout as she does... yikes... oh and squeeze on some more of that exact same conversation about your FB activity as well.. yaaaaay.So, let me get this straight... I now have to REMEMBER ALL MY UNIQUE PASSWORDS && double log in, && verify 3 ways, all to check a notification thats just a promotional email about the new apps GEWG will put out next week. AND then FINALLY the google security come forward to say they don't trust my log in (bc i've got a VPN) - - - (from guess who - G1 - duh!) and they really cant tell the difference between MY REAL actual login on my trusted device from what it must assume is a HAKKr logging in 3 states away. . . . . . E.V.E.R.Y. LOG - INNNN!at this point i am thinking about a jitterbug and some stress eating of sour worms to relax.but yeah the phones cool, other than that.",1
"This was my 2x trying Amazon Renewed. This time I purchased the LAST stated available 2023 described as ""In OEM box, Box shows wear from opening"". The Moto Razor Flip phone was described as ""Like new"". Immediately upon arrival w/o even opening the box I knew it was wrong as the package was far too light. I opened it & there was a Moto Razor w/obvious discoloration on the case from use + a CHIP in the bottom screen. Packaging was similar to a top end Samsung I ordered from Amazon Renewed & fulfilled by a 3rd Party in FL 2 years ago. I saved due to credit only $20 @ checkout over a NEW One. WORSE there's NO WAY to return this immediately (There' are 2 Amazon Return 2 locations within 2-5 minutes of my house. Just came back from one & CS stated ""I've never seen this"")). Instead Amazon MAY notify me when they'll ONLY pickup from my house in 3 days.I had this EXACT same problem with a $700+ Laptop that was supposed to be Brand New. I'm beyond a coder or tech guy & ran a battery cycle count software on that as the battery lasted 2 hours less than advertised. It was obviously a RETURN, re-sold as NEW, unless Compaq sells Laptops w/over 200 battery cycles already on them. Same thing w/2 PB's & a CH Android Tablet which still had the previous User's name & account information installed. Seriously, WHO is doing QC? I'll NEVER use Renewed again. Period. Even when you buy a NEW item it's 50/50 now you'll get someone else's return sold as New! eBay here I come again. Worst thing this was supposed to be a gift. OBVIOUS Screen CHIP really ticks me off. Since 2022 I'm now 2 for 8+ on purchases of tech devices. Buy with caution!",1
The system worked well for a few days .Then multiple issues launching any game arose.All games were bought new .Very aggravating.Not sure what to do now .I guess I just threw away money for a game console that barely works .Hope other people have better luck .Take care .,1
"Ever since I got this thing it’s been a source of frustration. It picks and chooses what games it allows me to play. Whenever I put a disk in it won’t read it, it’ll say open tray as of there isn’t even a dick inside. I have to open and close the tray 5+ times to get it to work. Sometimes it doesn’t. Some games it won’t play at all. I have a feeling that whoever inspected this thing before resale just looked it over and said “looks fine to me” and pushed it down the line. Piece of junk",1
"Not sure if I received a defective batch, but this set was horrible. All the “slimes” were sticky like glue and watery. Not useable. Waste of money.",1
"Well where do I begin? The tray door wasn't opening, handled that. It's not playing any of the games at all. This game system specifically said in good condition not seeing that at all. It's not even reading any of the games at all. So basically I just wasted $367 so I definitely feel like I have been scammed. This is so ridiculous. Ordered through Amazon I thought was a reliable place. Never had any problems before through them. So I figured why not? Well this is the absolute last time I'll be ordering anything that's refurbished or used. This is pure junk Xbox 360. Wasted my money and time. So thank you for that.....I hope this helps the next buyer plz beware of the scams.",1

I also didn't realize until I READ on the product info itself that the effects you might get if you're lucky will be for ""that day only""... purple cancels out yellow or something like that. This is a gimmick and was a complete and total waste of my good money. Can I get my money back? Please, I bought 2 bottles. I can send them both back one unopened.",1
The purple toothpaste does not dissolve (lather up). Good fall into sink from mouth while brushing.The purple color makes it appear whiter for a few moments only. Used for about 2 weeks. Waste,1
Don’t buy this buy Mint InstantPurple Color Corrector with nHAp. I haven’t bleached my teeth in a year since using that. I tried this to save money big mistake. This doesn’t even bring out the white at nothing. Plus the dispenser pull gadget inside became unhooked so it doesn’t work I have to shake the paste out after four days. Pure garbage.,1
I tried this product and can confirm that it does not preform as advertised. Day to day use did nothing to help improve the look of my teeth.If anyone has had any experience that was better than mine then great for you.,1
This product rendered useless as the product doesn’t pump out and there was no straw in the pump like most purple teeth whitening products in this category.,1
An explosion of toothpaste from every crevice but the one intended,1
It’s either very loose or just doesn’t fit. Trash.,1

Received the tube- it felt liquid when I picked it up to use- so I shook it quite a bit. Opened a bunch of liquid squinted out everywhere. put cap back on and shock it- get a little bit of pasty white material like toothpaste. Has been ongoing issue- tube usually only squirts liquid so it does not stick to toothbrush. Can't return it. Waste of Money. Going to make m y own!,1

I figured I was in trouble when a typo is prominently featured on the back cover, but the first page of the book removed all doubt. Wait - maybe I'm missing the point.

I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot, that I decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling. Please don't waste your money. I too, believe that the good reviews must have been written by the author's relatives. I will not put much faith in the reviews from now on!",1
"Rather than scratches and insect droppings, this one has random pixelations combined with muddy light and vague image resolution. Probably the cue should have been the packaging is straight out of your street corner bootleg dealer.If you've ever seen a reasonably good condition film copy, you know the defining visuals of his film are the crystal clear lighting contrasts in black and white. The surrounding countryside and 'old home' scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright, clear, and immediate.Here everything is dull, dark, and clouded. Or, if you remember the timbre and enunciation of Captain's commands, so are the visuals.After that, it is hard to believe this award winning, critically acclaimed film's best presentation is on YOUTUBE. Somewhere ""out there"" is a DVD that comes up to the standard of a 16mm public library reel.Just none of them appear to be on Amazon.",1

"I ordered the cake topper June 27, 2010. I was given an estimated shipping date of July 1-7, 2010. Those dates came & went with no cake topper. I contacted the seller twice with no response. I filed a claim with Amazon. I did end up receiving a cake topper on July 16, 2010; however, it's not even the one I ordered! The seller did refund my money, but has never contacted me or apologized for the mishap. I will never buy anything from the seller again. I looked at the seller's feedback & I'm not the only person they have done wrong, so buyer beware!!",1
"I am disappointed in its performance. It seems underpowered and is constantly trying to read CDs, half the time unsuccessfully. I am going to try to return it to Amazon.",1
"I did not know this was the audio cd of the game, I thought it could be used on the playstation. Maybe the other guys are from the US or somewhere where it is actually easy to get the game,and play it,but this was all in japanese and was not compatible with my machine. I am deeply disappointed as i love the arcade game, but the Dance stage euromix (Dance Dance Revolution equivalent) is lacking in decent tracks, many are jungle-y and are difficult to dance to them. Also, most of these tracks are unheard of here and are therefore not very enjoyable. However, my favourite are Keep on moving, make a Jam, and Video Killed the Radio star. But it gets a bit pedantic if you keep playing on these tracks. If anyone is in the same situation as I am, or those of you who are lucky enough the play on the newest version, can you please let me know where I can order one? I am in dance deprivation/boredom!",1

This book vaguely breezed across history and went into various types of timber structures. The mortise and tenon joints that were illustrated were fascinating but not practical for a home builder.,1
This product smells when you open the package and it appears one of the gel cushions leaks so I spent $10 and havent worn then. I wouldnt buy this product again. Dont waste your money on something you may not be able to use.,1
"I first tried buying this tape from a Marketplace seller. I sent it back because the tape quality was poor and the packaging looked unprofessional. After returning it I bought one from Amazon proper and . . . it was the same quality tape and the same packaging. Since I'm now sure this is not a bootleg tape, all I can say is . . . some videos are better than others.",1
"I should have read the prior reviews of this record before buying it. Although it appears to be a collection of new wave singles from the 80s, these are just cover versions sung by the ""Starlite Singers"". The description of the record says that it is by ""various artists"" implying that they are by the original artists, but this is not true. Total garbage. The one bright spot is that I got a prompt refund when I returned it.",1
"This is one of those cheesy compilations where they find session bands and similar sounding artists to sing the songs. These are NOT ORIGINAL SONGS BY THE ARTISTS. If you loved K-TEL CD's and don't care about hearing the artists originals, and don't care about cheap sounding synthesizers playing the music or that fact that some of the vocalists are pretty bad, then you might like this cd. But if you are a fan of the 80's and the amazing music it produced, then buy other collections and don't waste your money on this schlock!!!!",1
Bought this camera for Christmas. Had her open it first so she could film the nights party & NO TAPES ARE INCLUDED! Of course all stores are closed Christmas day so the thing is USELESS until the day after. Shame on Sony. How much would a tape included in the packace cost them ? Not included Battery chargers are ....,1
"If you purchase this data cable, you need to know that you will receive no real directions or information regarding what to check if nothing works. As directed, I downloaded all of the files from the SE site (70MB on dial up!), and then downloaded all of the user guides. Everything seemed to install ok, but nothing would make my phone be recognized. After that I scoured the SE site for troubleshooting info on their branded cable-in the hope that something would help me figure out the problem. After 2 full days of beating my head against the wall, I finally threw the cable and the useless CD that came with it in the trash.If I had used my brain I would have paid the extra $$ for a SE branded cable and software (and the support that comes along with that). I now have the real deal (SE data cable and software), and guess what? Yep, installation was a breeze and it works beautifully. You really do get what you pay for.",1

"Molly Myers, in her review of ""My Name is Rachel Corrie,"" describes the ISM as ""an organization dedicated to non-violence.""

You get what you pay for. This pillow is stiff and smelled like drying paint for 4 days. I thought I was getting a non name brand version of the Temperpedic pillow. I bought the real pillow for my mother years ago and paid many times the price. This thing doesn't even come close.,1
"The pillow I received is nothing like the one in the picture. The pillow that I received is approx half the size (in thickness) as the one I received. I am not happy with the seller (Moshelle's). I will never purchase from this company ever again. I am currently deployed Military and I feel that this company is very disrespectful and does not show it's Military members the proper courtesy when dealing with such issues. Do not buy this pillow, you will not be satisfied.",1

It worked about 40% of the time when I was standing less than two feet from the outlet. When I moved eight to ten feet away it worked about 5% of the. I would not recommend it.,1
"I never write reviews but I just felt compelled after I saw this video. It's 70% listening to parents and kids think about Thomas and maybe 30% Thomas related. What is worse is that you have to fast forward through a bunch of the rambling in order to see what amounts to a 5 minute story. And, there is only one song in the ""Sing A Long"". I really liked Thomas stories after watching them on PBS with my daughter. Next time, I will try to find those stories on video. They actually last about 15 minutes and do not involve mindless prattle from people I don't know.",1
"Unless I missed something, there are only one or two actual episodes on this DVD. The rest is a long commercial for the Thomas the Train centers and an ode to Ms. Allcroft. Waste of money.",1
"My 2 year old son is huge Thomas fan. This DVD has long introductions to each story in which children and adults are interviewed - my son couldn't care less. He just wants to see trains! We have a portable DVD player, and it is a big pain to try to fast forward past these introductions, and he (and I) just ends up frustrated. My advice - pick another DVD.",1

"This is one of the worst written books I have ever read.I wish I had saved my money and my time.The book is full of superlatives. Everything is ""the best ever experienced"" again and again.The characters NEVER become embraceable. One male character is pathetic while the other is a jerk. The female lead is portrayed as perhaps innocently unaware, but is really just stupid. Her friend is promiscuous, which is all we ever really get to know of her.The writing is at a level well below that of an adult reader. But, the content could not possibly be meant for a younger reader. Very inappropriate.Not sure who would really like this book.Maybe someone who really likes descriptions of food and does not care about plot, story development, characterization or any other facets of literature.Find yourself something with a little more substance, and I think you'll be much happier.",1

"I listened to the audio version of ""Cruel & Unusual"" on a recent trip to New Jersey and back. The first 2/3 of the book kept me on the edge of my seat, then... the whole thing collapsed in a heap at the end. Would have been much better if the author had stuck to writing a taut thriller instead of trying to drag in everything from evil Republican office holders to Nazi war criminals, all dumped into the mix at the last possible moment. After all the buildup, the ""who"" of the whodunnit ends up being... nobody in particular. And the fate of the evildoer? Nothin' much. Disappointing. Won't bother with Dr. Scarpetta or Ms. Cornwall again.I'm a little baffled by all the reviews that say, ""great book, bad ending..."" and still give it 3 stars or more. Isn't a mystery DEFINED by the ending, by how the author ties up all the loose ends and red herrings?",1
"In a word, Lacking. Her style of writing left me unable to appreciate the underlying story which, as a result, I found rather vacuous and inauthentic. So much so that I felt compelled to come write a review of this book so others might avoid making the same mistake I did. No offence Patricia.",1
"This movie was not only NOT funny, but it was excruciatingly boring. I think Adam was channeling the Aristocrats. Whilst Aristocrats was not as funny as it thought itself to be, it was still better than this garbage.",1
Entertaining in places but spoilt by lots of crudeness and dirty talk that degrades woman. In the end I found nothing memorable or funny about this film. Sad for Adam to seem him in such a trashy film.,1
"I used to enjoy Sandler's movies but this one is just....jeez, how to put it? Well, UNFUNNY.All characters are if not stupid, shallow and egotistical...Don't care how 'dramatic' was this supposed to be, his misogynistic prick persona is the worst ever. Just, don't watch it, really...You'll want those minutes from your life back.",1
Looks good. No leaks but this is NOT as advertised as being able to hook up to most reverse osmosis water filters which is why I bought it so save more counter top space. I have reached out to the sellar to try to troubleshoot shoot but no response,2

"Looks good but I was expecting 2 controllers And A headset. That's what they advertised when I got ahold of am. Azon, they were like sorry, yet their personal guarantee is on this that you will get everything so disappointed.",2
Yep 360S had some internet connection issues which forced me to buy the adapter which is fine. But major problem is some OG Xbox disc CAN play on this but you need the original official hard drive that contains the code. Which forced me to buy and hunt for a new official hard drive ! The hard drive in the picture is a knock off version which contains no special code ……,2

Not worth the hype in my opinion. There was VERY little difference in the before and after for me and my daughter.,2
I bought this item because of the 5 star reviews.I’ve used this several times with absolutely no difference in my teeth color. I would not recommend.,2
"I was super excited to try this carbon toothpaste that also whitens! The packaging is great and the color of the paste is pleasing to the eye. Here's the thing though, I don't think I'm the target demographic because it did nothing for my teeth. I'm trying not to blame the product because my teeth are pretty stained from when I smoked for years and also coffee. So I didn't notice any significant or even insignificant change to the color of my teeth when I used this but when I switched back to my usual whitening toothpaste, I of course noticed it immediately. Perhaps someone without the wear and tear of my dental history will have better luck. This could work on someone with only light staining on their teeth but unfortunately not for me.",2
"Tastes of grape, that's all, doesn't whiten teeth",2
It did not attach to the toothpaste tube tight enough.,2
"The product comes out as a foaming mess that has a disgusting feeling in the mouth. I tried it anyway, to give it a chance. Absolutely no difference in teeth color than before. Don't waste your money.",2
The seal was broken and the product was very moist from humidity and I will not be using.,2
If I had seen that these tablets were foaming toothpaste tablets I would not have purchased them. I ended up having to go to the store to purchase some without that ingredient.,2
"I expected that each eye would adjust as needed; however, the one eye that I needed improvement appeared to adjust but my other eye, without any sight problem, also adjusted so now I have the same problem but the other eye. Cheaper to keep as back up then return.",2
The autofocus works fine. I just had cataract surgery 4 weeks ago and the second eye last week so I couldn't focus to even use my cell phone. The glasses are cheaply made but will hopefully last for 5 more weeks until my prescription ones arrive.,2
"GOOD QUALITY LENSES BUT THE FRAME IS BROKE IN A MONTH, LIKE I'VE BOUGHT CHEAP QUALITY. VERY DISAPOINTED , SOMETHING WENT WRONG WITH MATERIAL THEY STARTED USE , HAD MY OTHER PAIR FOR YEARS AND IT TOOK A BEATING, THIS TIME VERYWEAK CONSTRUCTION",2
The lens came off several times and I ultimately lost one of the pait. The lenses were meticulously cleaned before installation. They worked well until the lens fell out Disappointed!,2
Too Heavy,2
"While I measured carefully, the clips were too narrow for my glasses so I returned them. Lesson learned--seller refunded less than half of the purchase price.",2
"I need very light reading correction (0.5), which these claim to help since they range 'automatically' from 0.5-2.5 in strength. At a normal reading distance for me, everything is very blurry with these on, there is no 'auto' adjusting. The product name also mentions ""multi flex focus dial"". I don't know what 'multi flex' is supposed to mean, but I can tell you there is NO focus dial. As far as I can tell they are plain 2.5 strength readers, which, for me, is way too strong. Color me disappointed and shame on the seller for keyword stuffing their product name with incorrect info.",2
AFTER OPENING THE PACKAGE AND CHARGING THE GLASSES I PUT THEM ON AND THEY SCRATCH MY NOSE. I CHECKED THEM AND THERE WAS NO NOSE PIECE TO PROTECT MY NOSE. I HAD TO RETURN THEM AND ORDER ANOTHER BRAND.,2
Quality is fine for the price but I look like Mrs Claus. lol. I'm not even that old.,2
"I might have ordered the wrong magnification, but I also didn't like the iridescent coating on the outside of the lenses.",2
The lens automatically fog up when you put the glasses on and I think they are low quality lens. Love the look and the replacement batteries but I will not reorder these.,2
"I decided to try bifocals for my first readers, hoping they’d save me from constantly taking them on and off. Unfortunately, they didn’t quite work out. The reading focal area is way too low, which makes it uncomfortable and awkward to use. The focus area is oddly positioned and doesn’t blend well with the rest of the frame, making it look unattractive. While they’ll do in an emergency, the quality just isn’t there. I ended up switching to a different brand with progressive lenses for a much better experience.",2
I've been wearing Foster Grant reading glasses for years and always purchase the same model. The glasses that I ordered were to be Ironman IronFlex black/red framed glasses. Instead of shipping the ordered glasses I was sent unframed glasses blue/grey#dg1123 IM1001 GUN. I was to receive IM2002 model but didn't. Caution buying these glasses.,2
I purchased these to replace my previous pair of the same glasses. These seem to be much larger and kept falling off my head/face. Will be returning these.,2
This is the third pair of these exactly same glasses that I’ve purchased. This pair was loose at the temples on arrival and tightening didn’t resolve the issue. Kept because they arrived at Christmas just before traveling out of town,2
Don’t waste your money on these glasses! Worn for reading only and the lens falls out! The arms are extremely tight. Very flimsy.,2
I dislike the feeling of wearing them and seeing outside the frames and inside. It was very odd and disconcerting. I returned them. They made you dizzy looking up.,2
Cannot wear for a long time as edges are hard. Have to line up perfectly as not to have double vision.,2
I braved the bright morning commute sunshine to test these. (I'm just a passenger) No shading at all. Yes I gave them time sat them on my dash too. No luck. Painful. Wearing my polarized sunglasses I could see some slight rainbow staring on the edges but not enough to tint the lenses. Also the bifocal line is really pronounced right in the middle of my eyeline - and maybe that's just the size of my face I have a smaller head. If you zoom in on my pic you can see what I'm talking about. I could still use inside or at home but only while specifically reading. I don't think I could walk around with the bifocal line.,2
Attempted to catch them from falling from my face and they snapped in 2..,2
Doesn’t cool at room the size it says it does:-(,2
"I usually don’t write reviews, especially negative ones. I liked this product when I initially got it. But after using it for only two summers the pump stopped working even with regular cleaning and maintenance. Because the water is no longer pumped into the filter, it does not actually cool anything. It looks like the pump can’t be easily replaced. So I liked it in the beginning but it didn’t last. Now I just use it as a bulky floor fan.",2
Don't recommend it,2
This unit just blows hot air around and doesn’t measure the temp in the room only the temp of air it’s putting out.,2
"The ice packs would melt and warm up fast, and you only felt the cool air when you are about 2 feet or closer. The fan does not blow hard/fast enough.",2
This product cools my from 95 degrees to about 90 degrees if I’m lucky. Save your money and buy an a/c unit.,2
It stays cool for a few hours and then doesn’t. It’s also difficult to clean as you can’t remove the tank.,2
Don’t cool down,2
Does not blow cold air long even with the ice pack in the bottom,2
I ordered this to cool a bed room for my kids. It’s hot and humid.. the AC UNIT needs work and thought this would help but wasn’t worth it and ima have to return.. I don’t feel the difference from fan to AC it’s all the same the humidifier looks like it works as the vents cleaned my air in 1day the filter was getting fDirty,2
The only time you cool off is if you’re right in front of it.I don’t not recommend and SUCH a waist of money!,2
Annoying flashing lights when off. Ice packs swell too much even half full. Good for a small room but not a powerful fan. Can't complain for the price though.EDIT 9/23/2022: Piece of junk now. Swing function quit working. Pump intermittent and indicator light quit working. Cheap for a reason. Would not buy again.,2
"Received this couple months ago doesn't do much ,,fan works better .not advisable for the money very disappointed",2
I bought this for a friend and watched it with him. I knew it would be bad and it was. I guess if you like this kind of thing then it would be good for you. I on the other hand have taste.,2
"Bad special effects, a completely wooden plot nailed to cardboard characters, bad acting and cheesy gore effects do not compliment would could have been a very scary movie. Inexplicably incestious Cat people live like cia undercover agents in a small town, and stake out victims to gain energy. There is no explanation as to what these creatures are, and basically the whole thing is a solid vehicle for a bunch of scenes involving painfully conspicious latex prop limbs being torn and split while the creatures feed off of the energy of fresh victims (one scene where a man has his hand cut off actually rivals luke skywalker's incredibly unconvincing appendage loss in ""The Empire Strikes Back). The cat people themselves are reminiscent of japanese rubber suit monsters (one almost expects power rangers to jump out) and the morphing special effects look ridiculous. Entertaining enough to warrant watching the whole thing ... even If not for any reason it intended to be.",2
"Well the it starts out pretty good. the plot is alright, the actors are pretty good and the special effects are amazing for when it was done. Then in the end it all gets wacky... almost like a comedy. One scene when the seriously dissturbed mom (Alice Krige) kills a guy whit a corncob! But when it really gets bad is in the end when you see how the ""sleepwalkers really look...",2
"It's terrible! About the only thing it had going for it were the special effects and the musical score. Don't get me wrong, I love Stephen King, and I love scary movies, but this one is just plain sick.",2
"This CD just about drove me nuts. I understand that rain is to be expected in a rainforest,but after listening to this recording my pets were lining up two-by-two. This CD is for you if you love a long rain and dripping sounds. I hated it; it was monotonous and I could swear that there were portions that were repeated because the person recording it had to fill up some space and nothing was available.Save your money!",2
"This book is not an easy read; to many diversions within the story to get excited about the character. It hurt my ""head"" to try and stay with it. I enjoy reading, but this book takes the joy out of reading! It has taken me months to get to the 6th chapter",2
"Very average movie, Jonny Debbie as wonderful as ever. If you want to see it then rent it, not a keeper",2
"Yes, Johnny Depp provides another great performance here, as does most of the cast. The story line is what drags this movie down. Beyond the slew of predictable lines and scenarios, I found the message of the film a bit shallow. ""Love conquers all...including schizophrenia."" It's just not life-like. Some of the imagery and allusions are heavy-handed at times. I wanted to scream, ""OK, I get it."" Not a terrible film, but not that great either. If you want to see a more compelling Depp film, see ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape.""",2
"Benny (Aidan Quinn) is the brother of an autistic girl named Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson). He's a bit restrictive and protective of her. Sam (Johnny Depp), the ""quirky"" guy, moves in. Hilarity ensues. So, what's the problem? The moviemakers were not content with making a funny, lighthearted movie. Instead, the movie gets very serious and preachy about several points - whether or not Joon can live on her own, whether or not Sam needs to get a job, etc. These questions are presented as ones with obvious answers, because, of course, love conquers all, as we learn in Hollywood. Sam is portrayed as the truly wise character of the movie, while crazy old Benny is still stuck on backwards ideas like earning money to provide for yourself and caring for the mentally handicapped.There were a few funny parts, courtesy of Johnny Depp, but I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie.",2
"Although Johnny Depp is to be lauded for his deft physical comedy in this romantic fairy tale, it isn't enough to save this implausible film. Depp plays a somewhat eccentric young man who finds himself filling in as a ""housemate"" to a young mentally ill girl who lives with her brother. Mary Stuart Masterson is effective as Joon, and Aidan Quinn does her sincerest best but the film ultimately fails in its ignorance of reality. Julianne Moore has an early appearance as Ruthie, the failed actress who works as a waitress and befriends Benny, Joon and Depp. The movie manages to sugar coat mental illness and we're asked to believe that this obviously disturbed young girl is capable of living on her own. While its message of love conquers all is admirable, the reality of Joon's situation is overshadowed by this sentimentality.",2
"what a boring and pretentious movie! after tortured about 15 minutes, all the family members started to look each other or one another, then all agreed at the same time to reject this stupid shallow movie. depp or no depp, after twenty years, he's still playing the similar roles again and again, and never grows tired of it. but to me, and to us, enough is enough.",2
"This book was okay. It spoke about how gays deal with sexual orientation issues in the workplace. The good thing about it is that it included case studies of a gay black man and a bisexual white woman; so the authors were trying to think about diversity within the LGBT community. However, this book is simplistic and doesn't say much. There are large-scale studies and anthologies out there about gays in the workplace that are more thorough, and just better. You should consider reading this, after you've read all the other stuff on the topic.",2
"Let me just say, I loved the movie Pearl Harbor. But I found the soundtrack to be disappointing. I bought it for the Faith Hill song ""There You'll Be"" If you are like me, I recommend the single.",2
"The so-called soundtrack for ""Pearl Harbor"" is a major disappointment. The film was full of great period songs and music. None of them are on the soundtrack. Instead, you can enjoy an hour of absolutely forgettable, mediocre orchestral background music. OK, the theme song is stirring, at least the first two or three times. But the rest is a real bore. When I want to listen to orchestral music, I go to Bach, Brahms and countless other true pros. Don't get bamboozled by this one!",2
"While the movie Pearl Harbor is amazing, the soundtrack does not follow suite. It begins with a mediocre ballad by Faith Hill and the remaining 8 songs, while nice to listen to, are not Hans Zimmer's best work. Tracks 2-4 are so similar it's hard to tell accompanies the numerous TV trailers. For a 3 hour movie, I them apart. It does not include the powerful music that expected a much longer soundtrack. I'm sure we'll get more music when a follow up CD is released. One will no doubt be released so that consumers who want a better soundtrack have to shell out more money.",2
"I bought this CD for Faith Hills song and hoped the rest of it would be good also. For a movie like this, and an event like this, the music just doesn't fit.There should be some very big, building music here and there isn't. It could have been much better.",2
I was disappointed in this soundtrack. The introductory and final songs were lackluster sentimentality. I would have hoped for something more from the producers. The instrumental offerings lacked excitement and musical tension. I would have though Zimmer would have known better.,2
"Zimmer mostly just rehashes past themes from other films he's done, then throws in a track collaborated on with Faith Hill and some generic period-type music. Big deal. The film stunk and the uninspired score just had me thinking how much better the other films he's worked on were. Zimmer's better than this. The same can be said for most of the directors he usually works with. Perhaps it was just a paycheck to him...who knows.",2
"after last year's majestic score for gladiator, i had high expectations for the pearl harbor soundtrack. much to my dismay, the music no more than ""sorta pretty"". it evokes no feelings like gladiator's worldly mood. plus, with all due respect to mr. zimmer, the defining chord sounds awfully familiar to a Enya song some years ago (i think it was enya). i don't need the faith hill song...... plus, unlike the gladiator score which the listener could visualize the story, the same isn't true with this release of the soundtrack. PLEASE GIVE US MORE MUSIC WITH A SECOND RELEASE!!",2
"Having read Ms. Manning's book, it is obvious that she has somehow managed to overlook perhaps the most important pioneer and innovator of what she calls the ""free energy"" movement:JOSEPH W. NEWMANIt is incredible to me that she could write such a book without including Joseph Newman's long struggle to bring forth his revolutionary technology. Writing such a book without featuring the work of Joseph Newman is as ridiculous as writing a book about the history of aviation and omitting any reference to the Wright Brothers.I would suggest that she view his website videos at:... and perhaps she would discover the essential nature of his successful and innovative technology.Gary",2
"Unfortunately percussion has completeley spoiled all tracks.This is not Bossa Nova,not even Samba.Sorry for a great project with great arrangements.",2
"One month ago (and even earlier) this set was selling for less than half ($41) this current price ($89). While it was a great series that I thoroughly enjoyed watching as a kid, my desire to finally buy it for Christmas has been completely eliminated by the equivalent of holiday induced price gouging. I'll wait till it goes back to a reasonable price. More than a little upset with Amazon over this one. Merry Chri$tma$.",2
Unlike most SciFi shows this show had NO BASIS IN FACT. I must have been much more forgiving as a kid I remembered liking this show at least a little but after watching it again the bazaar story lines and unforgivable scientific inaccuracy I have to give this a total thumbs down.,2
"Not sure whether the original recordings were not preserved well or just our copy is bad, but the sound cuts out frequently on each episode. Would not buy this again.",2
"Even while some of the episodes are questionable and not very realistic, this is a classic show now. Having two seasons, the special effects of the time is still top-notch. While the acting is mediocre, and the story set up is sometimes way out (It was the 70's) there is some entertaining value. As a writer, I still look through this medium to see if there were any parts that can be embellished for newer ideas. What toppled the ratings of this show was the ""Mind"" entity beings that appeared on the first six or so episodes. But after that the writing started to switch to a more action oriented show. I am still looking through the DVD's as I try to remember the better episodes. Quality of picture is fine on widescreen TV's, but this is not an HDTV product.",2
"I found the book to be very general and basic. Most of the information I already knew. There are methods of retrofitting old windows I have seen on home type programs that lightly discuss these topics and which the book does not. Also, the book could use a lot more diagrams and discussions on finishes and paint. The book limits itself to actually restoring to original working condition old windows and nothing about updating. This book is for beginners except that for beginners there should be a lot more pictures. I did find some good tips but not the information I was personally hopeing to find. I am selling the book back.",2
Goes a mile wide and an inch deep. I would rather the same book but each chapter by an expert in that area with a lesson/example.,2
"The FM stereo does not pick up well at all. I cannot get many local stations. The description says it uses USB 1.1 for quick transfers. This is misleading advertising. USB 1.1 is the slower transfer method. USB 2.0 is the faster one.Where this device excels is in conjunction with a MP3 player. The rechargeable battery means you can use it away from a power supply for a long time. The sound is excellent.This would get 3 stars due to the slower transfer speed, false advertising, and poor FM. It gets 2 stars because the price is too high for a refurbished model.I got this for $19.99 directly from Philips web site. I would check there first.",2
"Ok, so I have not actually heard this WHOLE cd. I did hear Bob sing on The Bachelor show and was impressed, but then I heard ""his"" first single, Girlfriend, and was less than impressed. This is for two reasons: a) Bob doesn't really have the rock vibe, which just makes his version of Girlfriend sound wrong (in his defense, the song I heard him sing on tv was Open Arms by Journey, an excellent song, and not easy to sing I don't think). b) I can't deal with the fact that I have not heard Bob publicly credit the originators of the song Girlfriend. The July For Kings version is 100 times better than Bob's, and while I know the band probably appreciates the publicity, they are not getting all the credit they deserve. Check out JFK's cd ""Swim"" and make your own comparison, though if you like Bob's single this CD will likely not disappoint your tastes.",2
"I kinda liked this book for awhile. Some strange humor and interesting to see what is was like to travel at the time of Twain. I thought it was a litte long and boring and though (only read 3/4 of it). Not very exciting and a lot of quotes from other esoteric sources. Also, he makes reference to Arabian nights while in India. Aren't those stories set in the middle east and north africa? (kinda lame)",2
This was a great deal if it had worked. The gas regulator had leak by when set to zero. Amazon was not good about sending a new one they said the price had gone up and I would have to pay the new increased price. I just got a RMA and returned it. Could not get the seller on the phone. Tired of messing with it went to welding supplier and bought new. Some things just should be bought locally.,2
This product does an adequate job of cleaning your feet and does provide some relief for tired aching feet !,2
"I pre-ordered this foot massage spa to relieve niggling pain in my feet. Though the product operated exactly as per the manual, it was rather tame. It didn't really help reduce the pain, rather it merely tried to soothe the feet. Your feet will feel good so long as they are in the spa, but the spa does nothing to reduce the pain. I didn't think its worth spending so much money to just put my feet in hot water (& that too without salts). I've returned the product.",2
"Bought this unit directly from Brookstone over 6 months ago. Was initially great very hot water and jets were comfortable but stopped working after 4 uses. Brookstone would not replace because after it was after ""limited"" warranty coverage. This was an expensive unit and not sure if I would get another one from Brookstone or try cheaper model that hopefully won't break down.",2
I loved the idea of this foot bathbut the product leaked. Brookstone was great to work with for the return.,2
"I purchased this item thinking what I read about it here on Amazon would be true. Unfortunately the heated foot bath and Message is not what it sounds like. The heated part works ok, but as far as the message part, not even close. And the jets, come on, give me a break. For what I paid for this, over $100.00 and the most expensive one that Amazon had at the time I thought I would be getting a good foot bath. If I had to rate this from 1-10 I would give it a 3. Only because it does keep the water warm. In my opinion it is not worth the money or even half of what I paid for it.",2
"Bought this thing as a gift for my wife. She was really excited to get it. Used it twice, with out any salts, and it worked great. Third time she went to use it, the jets didn't work. Got a hold of the company who sold it, and they said no problem, just send it back. So I'm thinking they are going to send me a new one, that works. Made me pay the return shipping, and just put the money back on my credit card.If I sold a defective item to someone, I sure as hell wouldn't ask them to pay for return shipping.",2
"By the time this 9th entry in the Jason Voorhees franchise was released, the series had become tired and ultimately redundant. In an effort to put more life in it, we are faced with a Jason who is killed but like in THE HIDDEN (a far superior film), he manages to live using host bodies. Although the screenwriters try to give us more motivation for Jason's murderous rampage, there is little suspense or novelty in the movie. Jason manages to kill off a few people, and his sister is recruited to finish him off. No real acting honors in this one, although Steven Culp manages to do well in his role as a tabloid tv producer. The ending is a joke in itself, with its reference to future Jason adventures. Not the best in this series.",2
"I cant beleive they did this, they added a crapy plot, ""only a vorhees can kill a vorhees"" WTF??!!!!???!! jason had a sister? what a stupid plot, then at the end you see freddy's hand grabbing jasons mask and pulling it down under the ground (telling me freddy vs. jason is next).if you want to collect the friday the 13th film's i sugest part's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and X.",2
Yes part 9 or Jason goes to hell is a classy entry in the series.Jason's soul jumping from one body to the next might seem ridiculous but they have tried everything else.,2
"Well, I thought Friday the 13th part 5 was bad!? This is the worst ""Friday"" by far and it's only redeeming quality is the nice DVD release and the fact it opens the door for Freddy VS Jason! For that reason alone I rate it 1 1/2 stars!Unfortunately Freddy VS Jason was shelved for many years and was released after Jason X?! Which doesn't make any sense, so we have to pretend that Freddy VS Jason came out before Jason X to have this even begin to make sense.(I use the term loosely!) The only postive thing I can say about this film is that it's got a way too good DVD release and it makes Jason X and Freddy VS Jason look all that much better!I was really disappointed with this entry even though 'Jason Takes Manhattan' isn't much better! If you want to complete the Friday the 13th series, it should be seen as it does set up the superior sequel 'Freddy VS Jason'.",2
How could anyone think that Jason was dead. That killer in it was smart in saying he's not but what makes the world think he can stop Jason. I was really disappointed with this one even though my standards for Friday movies are extremely low. I really only watched this for the end part when Freddy's hand pulls Jason into hell and belive me it wasn't worth it one bit.Another horrible thing about this movie was it's cast. That fat diner owner was so stupid with the whole Vorhees Birger and Jason fries. When Jason came in there I was so happy when all of them were killed. This one was really disappointed when I saw this and it isn't even worht the two star rating I gave it.,2
"I have always been a fan of the Friday the 13th series. I'd seen each of the movies a dozen times, but had somehow missed this particular movie. I barely even remembered hearing about it.I finally got to see it a few days ago and, wow... I mean, I honestly gave this movie a chance. I really did. This installment into the series is what PART 3 was to the HALLOWEEN series. Jason is barely in the movie. When you do see him, his makeup job is so weak that he becomes more comical than imposing or frightening. Now, I love Kane Hodder as Jason, but the acting in this movie is absolutely bottom shelf. There are a few decent visual effects, yet there are more than enough cheesy effects to counter and totally eclipse the good.This is the 2nd ""mulligan"" of the series: along with part 5, fans will wish they could simply remove them from the series and forever forget them.",2
"Jason, the living, breathing essence of evil, is back for another fierce fling. Tracked down and blown to bits by a special FBI task force, everyone now assumes that he's finally dead. But everyone is wrong. Jason has been reborn with the ability to assume the identity of anyone he touches. The terrifying truth is that he could be anywhere. Or anybody.One of the weaker installments in the franchise. The one bright spot in the film is actor Steven Williams (who would later play the role of ""Mr. X"" in the series ""The X-Files""). His character is interesting, and he plays it with energy and comedic touches.",2
THIS MOVIE IS THE WORST OF THE SERIES. JASON IS ONLY IN 2 SCENES THE BEGINNING AND THE END. THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE MOVIE HE IS POSSESSING PEOPLE AND CONTROLLING THEM FROM INSIDE THEIR BODIES. THIS MOVIE BLOWS PART 5 IS BETTER AND TAT BLOWED TO 5 IS BETTER CUS THEY ACTUALLY HAD A JASON LOOK ALIKE AND U FIRST THINK ITS JASON. I GAVE THIS MOVIE 2 STARS CUS OF THE AMOUNT OF GORE IN IT.,2
"First off I LOVE THE ""FRIDAY THE 13th"" FILMS!!, but as a movie fan this is BY FAR the WORST ""Friday"" film off them all, turning one of the most popular slashers of all time into what looks like one of the ""ALIENS"" after bursting through a chest and then having him switching from body to body ala ""Invasion of the body snatchers"" has to be ONE OF THE WORST IDEAS IN MOVIE HISTORY!! About the only thing that was semi enjoyable in the film was the end and I wont spoil it for you guys that havent seen it. I gave it 2 stars, one because the movie is watchable and the other because im a fan of the series. If your a collector of the ""Friday"" films its a no-brainer to get it to complete your collection. If you're looking for a good horror flick...STAY AAWWAAYYYY!!!",2
"Now I know that horror flicks aren't supposed to make alot of sense, but there comes a point where leaving too much unexplained and unaccounted for detracts from the quality of the movie. And that is the case with this film--how does Jason have a long-lost sister? What is the Necronomicon doing in the house? What's with the bounty hunter and his special dagger? Not very well thought out.",2
I watched the special features of Jason goes to hell. They said this is the end of all Jason movies. Ya ok.... do they really think the way they ended it no one is going to think of a way for him to come out of hell. If Jason was able to come from hell to grab his hooky mask and laugh about it. I'm pretty sure that mean's he will or can come back from hell. But nice try on trying to end this movie. Which by the way is a big change out of all Jason movies. What is the big changes in this movie compared to all the others? Well Jason is able to kill living in different body's.,2
"this movie was almost as bad as ""Jason X"" (quite possibly the WORST sequel to come out of any movie ever - and ive seen major league 2: back to the minors).this movie forces you to sit through an hour and a half of boring ""weve-seen-this-before"" horror movie cliches only to find the best bit of the whole thing is the last 30 seconds.however, if youre a die-hard fan of the friday the 13th series (which means you should have seen this years ago) and actually had to pay to see Jason X, this movie is for you - but im sure youll agree with me.",2
What's wrong with the screen? It's too bright. They were REALLY struggling to keep FRIDAY13 alive by this point. So much so that Paramount gave up on it. It's their own fault for not making them better than they should have been. My Friday the 13th rewrites will be 10 times better I promise you that.,2
I expected a little more from this brand. The case fits so well and protects the phone. The sides of this case discoloured within the first two weeks of using and now looks very average. Would not purchase again.,3
The set is fine overall for the price. The metal on all knives is rather thin and somewhat flexible. Not the best quality but suitable for home use. The wood block holds all the knives but maybe could have been a darker wood. Like previously mentioned for the price its fine. How they will hold up is a test of time.,3
"This is the lamest product design ever. It does not store easily as advertised because all the stuff that comes with it doesn't fit in it. Not even the manual! I couldn't even figure out how to get it back in the box it came in. So now I have to buy a box to put it all in, so I don't lose pieces and parts. Very, very, very disappointed. This problem could have been easily avoided with a better design for the product, or if they included a plastic box just big enough to store everything in.The cutting area is pretty small, so you have to cut your produce or whatever in half or so, so that it will fit on the cutting area and you can close the unit to do the cutting. Again, lame!!! Again, the problem could be easily avoided by making the product larger in general. That said, it does cut as advertised, at least with the ""garnish blade"".I bought this specifically for making Pico. That means using the small and maybe the large dicing blades. The goal was to have a quicker and easier way to do it, rather than using my big kitchenaid mixer with the food processing attachment. That device does a wonderful job by the way, but our kitchen is very small so my wife makes me store it in the basement. My goal with THIS product was to have something I could keep in the kitchen cabinet.I didn't have everything I needed to make pico tonight, so I used it to make fajitas. I cut onions and three different kinds of peppers with it. For the onion, I had to cut that in half to make it fit in the cutting area so it would cut. For the big bell peppers, I had to cut them in half, and then in half then other way. I really expected better.Overall, the plastic is decent quality for the purpose, as far as I can tell. It also cleaned up fairly easily.I can't comment on its various other functions yet, as I just got the thing yesterday! But that didn't stop Amazon from asking for a review, so here it is.",3
"The product is not heavy but still will serve the purpose for our event. However, no screws were included and need to find replacements.;",3
Came dented and didn’t have enough time before my gathering to get a new one. Otherwise it works fine,3
"I expect a fluffy quilt. This is a flat blanket, nothing more.",3
"I love the scent, but the scent didn’t last. I’ve shaken it and added more stick, flipping everyday. I wish it was better.",3
The media could not be loaded. The color and shelf itself is pretty. I expected to be sturdier for prize. The concept is smart but they needed to add possibly another bar within the shelf to actually support better. Limited use for shelf because when adding additional items the shelf starts to lower in front part and looks like items will fall off and it’s not flush against the wall. I expected more considering price. Very cute design and great if hanging lighter items then books or albums. Great if for Knick knacks. Would not repurchase for my intended use.,3
"When I saw this online, I thought it was cute and decided to buy this as a Christmas gift for my in-laws. However, after receiving it, I don’t think the quality is too good and I’m really disappointed in the magnets. The concept is nice, but the magnets I received are all marked up and chipped. Very disappointing.",3
It's a nice looking decoration. Plastic and smaller than expected. I should have read the complete description but skipped ahead when it was on sale.,3
A bit smaller than I expected,3
"It's a very good computer, very pleasing to the eye. The only problem I have with it is that it's incompatible with the windows 11 upgrade. I honestly thought I grabbed the windows 11 PC but unfortunately I didn't. Besides that little hiccup, it runs smoothly.",3
"Cpu cooler is bad but the pc is good value for the discount, also it is very difficult if you want to upgrade it since the specs are propierty",3
"It's good enough for gaming. RAM, not the best—you could buy more yourself. But looking back, given all of these components this thing is super overpriced. You could build your own for half the price with the same components. Either look for another product or just build your own.",3
For the customers: this is what you should know it does not have a Optical drive a.k.a. DVD player they should put that in the description saying it doesn’t have one but it’s not there it doesn’t say it does or doesn’t either way I want to use it for other things other than gaming the loads really fast in the Internet is really fast when it’s loaded the games take less time to download to my previous computer I played breath edge and it works fine just got hiccups here and there but you can upgrade.this the other problem is there’s no option or any way to put a optical drive in not a single port and that really ticks me off if you didn’t have one it should be advertise not having one and I would’ve went with the $600 one with the warranty about 700 which only had three fans and 250 Megabytes. The only other option is to go in a sternal optical drive a.k.a. DVD player CD player that’s also a pain in the ass you have to make sure that it’s able to read not just burn learned that the hard way make sure you read the descriptions and look for what is and what isn’t mentioned.To the manufacturer: this is borderline false advertisement you should really mention that it doesn’t have one if you’re not going to install it or even an option for someone who buys it to put one in themselves not everyone streams games online some people still get hardcopies that’s something to take in mine I don’t have a problem with the look I do have a problem with not seeing or mentioning certain things in your description for future references this would be best if an external hard drive doesn’t work I will be getting a full refund and I’m going with a different company very disappointed.,3
For old games 100% good but when you got some récent games you gonna surfer. But you know i run obs and my games Steel pretty descent bit it works,3
So everything arrived in time and everything worked BUT the monitor. Like the monitor flashes. Which is sad. My son got creative and used an old tv to connect everything. But keyboard quality is good and everything else but the monitor is good.,3
Looks good. Very compact. Does not upgrade and very limited in what games you can play.So i returned it. Still waiting for my refund. Was sent back over 1 month ago.,3
"I have the series S 500gig from when they came out. The 1tb unit should be just as fast “actually faster” to load since it’s a better read/write SSD BUT ITS NOT. Already tried to exchange it since the Xbox reb said it should run great but they would only exchange it with a refurb. And 90 day warranty when I payed for the year warranty but it’s not transferable or refundable. GOING TO STICK WITH PC GAMING, consoles are just not worth it.",3
It works plays the games but it does like to turn on its own when not it use. Has turned off on its own while using it but not when playing a game.other than that works great,3
"The build quality of this stand is excellent and the lights look great, there are just two issues with it. Firstly, this rubber appendage sticking out at me. I have a wireless mouse so have literally no use for this, I'm able to remove it but now have this ugly gaping hole instead. I may be able to ignore it or try and cover it, but for a premium stand this is a bit daft.However the most irritating problem is that the stand doesn't retain the colour I last set it to. I use a docking station and frequently switch between machines, and every time I do I have to keep pressing the button until I get back to my colour.It may sound like a petty complaint but this isn't the cheapest stand on the market and this is a really stupid problem to have. If my cheap and crappy £10 mousepad from China can do it then I don't see why this can't.",3
"For the price and renewed original Xbox Console, you might think you'd be getting a good deal. Little did I know that the pop-open tray couldn't slide out on the first day of gaming my favorite game, that being the ""Counter-Strike"" Shooter game for the Original Xbox. So I say to myself: either I leave the Disc inside the Xbox, play CS, and make a promise to myself not to break the disk tray even more. Turns out the console works, but no CD Pop-Out capability. Still works fine. Dare I remove that disc for a different game from the Disk tray, and I would be asking for a no longer working Xbox. however the good news I have to share with you all is that I can still play Counter-Strike on the renewed Xbox I ordered, but I can't play other games because I'm too afraid the tray might get stuck and possibly break. So a word to the wise ""If it's broken, but still works, then don't break it anymore."" I guess the Xbox has been around for a very long time. Meaning old products come with defects or some kind of technical problem that can't be fixed. But on a good note, Whenever I look at my turned off Xbox, and see the game controller connected to the console, I get the feeling it's telling me to load up Counter-Strike for one more round. Looking at it, makes me want to call this console, the Counter-Strike Xbox!",3
"After a few days with the phone, I can say that it's pretty sub-par. It's definitely a step up from my previous device, but I honestly expected more from a 5G Galaxy device in 2024.The camera is nice, and the body is solid. The screen is beautiful, visually, but is slow and unresponsive, at times refusing to register taps and swipes.I've owned Galaxy devices before, but the Samsung bloatware on this one takes the cake. Dozens of apps are preloaded that you'll have to either disable or uninstall to get some of the precious memory back, and OneUI is aggressively intrusive, causing compatibility and sign in issues with just about everything you want to use.I suppose this is a case of get-what-you-pay-for, but the user experience seems oddly frustrating, given the promised five years of support.This phone has reaffirmed that the Samsung device environment is not for me.",3
"Product arrived nicely packaged and not damaged with all parts in place. After I hooked everything up I went to open the disc tray and it would not open. This was the exact same issue I had on my previous Xbox 360. After fighting with the disc tray I was able to get open.Xbox would repeatedly “freeze” and become unresponsive. Only way to correct issue was to unplug power.Do yourself a favor and either don’t buy, or make sure you get a warranty. I was able to return mine and the seller was very easy to work with on the refund process.",3
Not enough storage to keep 10 games on it and expansion storage is as expensive as console and external hard drive you have to move games back and forth to play,3
"After purchasing the ""3 Tube"" lamp; I went on to get the ""Shark"" and the ""Jellyfish"" lamps and neither had the USB or battery power sources. Also they didn't have the touch button to change the colors. Still a cool little light sculptures but I got a definite sense of El Cheapo. If this doesn't bother you then go ahead with the purchase. For my use, the USB &a battery setup was a major consideration, and I probably would not have bought the other 2 had I known, but all 3 models were in the same product description.",3
This product looks nice but I find it too bright to be used as a night light. I could also not find a dimmer switch that worked to dim this lamp.,3
"His foot ripped off, leaking sand everywhere. No way to fix it.",3
"Was very hopeful that this product would reduce the coffee stains on my teeth. After applying the toothpaste and scrubbing and scrubbing, I couldn't get the purple off that had stained the tartar in between my teeth. It took a couple more intense sessions to fade the purple. There was some fading on the stains on the surface of the teeth but didn't want to look like a Halloween ghoul so did not continue to use.",3
is ok not what expected,3

Great product.,3
"This toothpaste gets your teeth clean. I find that other natural toothpastes don’t get your teeth as scrubbed clean like the usual Colgates, Crest, etc. toothpastes, however, this one did. The purple color was did not stain your teeth and it actually lathers up well and turns white. The taste wasn’t off-putting and wasn’t too mild nor too overwhelming. I don’t know if it whitened my teeth much, but one of my friends told me that for teeth whitening toothpastes to work you actually have to let them sit on your teeth for at least 15 minutes each time you brush. I am trying to implement that into my daily routine. For the price, and compared to other whitening toothpastes, I don’t think the price is worth it.",3
"So, I have been using this toothpaste for about 2 months now. Not really seeing any whitening effects, but otherwise really like it. Nice flavor, gentle on my gums, teeth feel clean. No bad morning breath. But this is dang expensive to not whiten my teeth. Likely won't reorder at this price",3
"It’s ok, it I like the pastier ones better. This is the equivalent of foamed hand soap as opposed to regular hand soap. Will look for a different one next time",3
"Used with both Crest and Colgate toothpastes. Instead of a screw-tight fit, the cap will begin to just spin. That said, if you tighten to just before it starts spinning, then it work fine. Just be aware that it's essentially still an open tube so toothpaste will dry a bit over time.",3
Doesn’t fit my grandsons toothpaste tube,3
"The formula definitely offers a very temporary Whiteness to teeth, but sadly does not last further than a few minutes.There is also no cleaning component within the foam.Although it does taste quite nice and gives an immediate whiteness, the product does not live up to the hype.",3
I didn’t notice a difference with my teeth. Not pleased.,3
"It’s not “unflavored,” it’s sweetened with sorbitol. My bad, should have read the ingredient list. Otherwise, I like it: a little foam, a good clean feel to my mouth.",3
"Usually love Colgate, but this toothpaste has a runny consistency and my daughter gets it all over the place. She loves the flavor, but I am not a fan.",3
Lovely taste.. Kids love it.. But oh my the price is ridiculous. Won't be buying this again.,3
Got this after watching videos and seeing reviews of how great it works. I have been using it for over a week now and see no difference in the whitening of my teeth. The paste also globs up on my teeth and doesn't distribute evenly. Don't trust purple tooth paste.,3
"This was too gritty, got stuck between my teeth and I needed to floss and rinse after brushing. The flavor was good and my teeth felt clean but i just can't get over how gritty it is.",3
"I barely got into toothpaste tablets and tried out NOBS really like it so I seen these at a better price, but very brittle and my mouth didn’t feel so clean after. I would use 3 tablets just to feel clean.",3
"The media could not be loaded. My ear canals must be very clean, because nothing came out while using this, except the irrigation water. I heated the water to 98° F. Never use cold or hot water to irrigate your ears. It should always be around body temperature. This product has 4 streams of water and different levels of pressure. The pressure was good, but no ear wax came out. I really wanted to like this, but after using it, my ears actually felt plugged. Two hours later and lots of q-tips trying to soak up the moisture, my ears still feel plugged. From now on, I will leave ear irrigation to the professionals.",3
works ok doesnt have as much pressure as i hoped however i do understand why too much and water would shoot out the my other ear,3
"I think I was expecting more because of the brand. It would be nice if the chambers marked which ways the batteries went in. The product doesn’t feel solid. Seems cheaply made and, it’s really loud. It would also be nice if there were a carry case or bag for the brush heads.",3
"I have mixed feelings about this ear wax camera. I thought maybe I would be able to see down my ear canal to the eardrum, but that is not possible because the canal curves. Also, the scraper sits in front of the camera and would need to be way down the canal before the camera could see. I don’t feel this is safe to put down the ear canal. The metal scrapers included with the kit are definitely not safe. Don’t put this stuff down your ear canal! Leave that to doctors.Now the mixed feeling part is because the camera is actually pretty cool. You can see things really close up. It functions like a low power microscope displaying on your phone. I ran it across my skin and could see every pore and every hair and every blemish in super close detail. Creepy looking honestly. I was able to see around the sides of my teeth close up. I could see the individual pixels on my TV screen. You get the idea. The app takes pictures and video too.",3
"THIS IS THE MOST UNDERATTED ALBUM IN PRIORITY RECORDS HEYDAYS. I CAN'T FIND ANY OTHER MUSIC BY THEM EXCEPT 1 OTHER SONG ON A COMP. CD THAT IS MORE THAN TEN YEARS OLD. IF ANYONE KNOWS WHERE I CAN FIND SOME MORE MUSIC BY THESE GUYS LET ME KNOW. HASTA, AND DRINK OLD ENGLISH",3
"The sensor installed and worked OK. Make sure you have the special 7/8"" socket with the slot in the side in order to remove the old one. This O2 Sensor is not exactly as pictured, it deos not have the metal spring cable support on top of the sensor. I wonder how long it will hold up since the cable is not supported very well and seems to be a bit shorter than the original.",3
"A wealth of important and useful information. However, AVID editors will find not one word in this book about preparing material and exporting from AVID systems to DVD Studio Pro 4. It's bias is Final Cut, which is the default standard for this guide",3
"This product is affordable. it arrived with all parts and some (extra screw was nice). The instructions are horrible. Drive is slow and USB port was rusted and/or corroded. comes with tools too! I was expecting at the price just the enclosure and nothing else (except a decent manual which is mandatory).Pro: affordable, comes with partsCon: you get what you paid for, Damaged port, Piss poor user manualTip: Dont use this for important data. This is not for back up.",3
HDD Enclosures are always confusing as there are so many available in the market with so different ways of connecting peripheral/auxiliary devices. I went through a large list of HDD Enclosures and after couple of days purchased this item - waited for couple of days only to find out that this enclosure does not fit my internal hard disk. The board had some soldering blemishes but never had a chance to test the connectivity. The build looks pretty ok and it was a great ide to include the screw driver as part of the package - It was really helpful. Be sure of what Hard disks you are using - SATA is common these days. I ended up buying a SATA to USB cable that served the purpose of transferring data from my old hard disk to a newer one. This product may be good for the price advertised but ensure that this one serves the purpose. This would fit only HDD of laptops cos its 2.5inch and would not work with the bigger solid state drives - the ones which are normally used for desktop,3
"The device works, but you have to be careful with it. The IDE connection is not very deep and doesn't seem to be reliable. On the top of that, IDE connection is the only thing that hold the drive inside the case. While I am moving around with enclosure, I can hear the hard drive rattling inside.The Enclosure is OK for the stationary setup, but would not work for any mobile tasks.",3
This product is not for you if your going to use this as you primary portable hard dive. The only use for this enclosure is to retrieve data from another HDD.The solder joints are weak and look like their about to break.This product is not going to last very long so get a this is not for you if your going use it long term.,3
"Apparently, not all 2.5"" laptop drives are the same, or perhaps what i have isn't exactly a 2.5"" drive (IBM Travelstar, DCXA-210000, out of an old Dell laptop(?)). It didn't fit in the aluminum case... real close, but no cigar. Maybe if this drive had ever so slightly rounded edges along it's length it would fit.Fortunately, this is acceptable for my needs. It electronically edge-connected to my drive & provides the USB2.0 interface, but i do have to leave the drive out of the case, naked / exposed. O-well. 'Works.Karl*----->",3
"First things first, this enclosure is not blue, as listed. It is silver, and looks very similar to my other enclosure, which causes me some confusion, and is why I bought (or attempted to) a blue one.Otherwise, it works fairly well. Can get a little hot since it lacks fans, but keep it off of any insulating surface and it's fine.",3
"it took me a few extra minutes to plug in my drive and the usb cable came with the drive didn't work at first, but I figure out that problem and now it works great. Quiet, fast and slim.The vendor sent me a replacement usb cable no extra charge.Thx.",3
"As an enclosure, it seems to work fine. I knew it was cheap; we'll see how it fares over a period of time.My only quibble is the cable. I don't mind the Y-cable for use with computers that need the extra connection for power. It's the fact that the cable is a nonstandard USB A-A. Almost every other USB drive is A-B or A-mini B. Why does this matter? Because if you lose the cable, it'll be a hassle to replace it. As a consultant I have a lot of external drives, and don't want to worry about keeping specific cables with specific drives.",3
"Well, i have had it for a while and it was working. But then my computer suddenly stopped realizing it was even plugged in. So i tried another computer, and then my laptop, but nothing. I think it may be the driver, but I am just warning you people that you need to be careful.",3
"This drive works as advertised, my issue comes from the fact that the connector on the drive is a USB A connector. This makes things a little tough if you lose the cable - because it isn't easily replaced with either a mini or micro USB end, or the standard USB B connector. I doubt I'll get another one - though once connected it did work as expected.",3
"Like the title says, it does what it needs to and nothing more. I had to et one of these to do a data recovery from my brothers laptop.The case itself is well designed accept for the back plastic cover. It will take some jimmying to get it back on once the harddrive is installed in it. BUT YOU CAN DO IT.Also, don't loose the original usb cable. Its not proprietary but its a cross-over USB.Performs as expected and costs almost nothing compared to the alternatives I've seen in the past",3
"Works fine with Windows XP but unfortunately I bought this to access data on my old drive from a computer using Windows 7. Windows 7 says the drive is invalid and only give me an option to format it. Odd too since the data on the drive was all created in Windows 7. I have not yet tried that because I wanted to pull some data off of it first. I had to connect it to my work computer that uses Windows XP and share over the network to pull data.On a side note: this comes with a USB cord that has three plugs and no instructions at all on which one goes to enclosure, which one is supposed to plug in or if it even matters. One of the plugs is longer and thicker my guess is that one is for USB ports that are further away from where you want to put the drive but then I don't know since there are NO INSTRUCTIONS.",3
It has teenie-tiny phillips screws to hold in the top. Had to stuff some folded paper down inside because the case is longer than my HD and it kept sliding back and forth. The did supply a little phillips driver for those screws but the head of the supplied driver was way too big for the screws. What a joke. It worked once mounted and modified but it should have some foam or something to account for different length HDs and some click-in type of mounting instead of screws like those that are in your glasses. These screws are going to get lost and screw into plastic directly so eventually will strip out its socket. It does have a nice slip-in case and sleek color.,3
"This product was easy to set up and install. With a DVD it has pretty good surround sound and appears to be well balanced. The wireless rear speakers work well. One feature which was suprisingly missing, however, was the ability to connect the sound from your digital cable box by means of a fiberoptical connection so that you would get true dolby when the show is broadcast in dolby 5.1.",3
"This book provides examples of how to do certain special effects.It was definitely more of a ""tips and tricks"" book than it was a learning resource. Just follow the steps, and go ""WOW"" just like the title.It doesn't really explain in detail how the trick was done and why you're doing a certain step. Most photoshop gurus will just scoff at this book, and most newbies will walk away amazed, but no smarter about photoshop than before they read it.The latter portions of the book was nothing more than a summary of the different photoshop filters found in commercial filter packages. I question why thoese filters were even in the book; it seemed like advertising that does not benefit the readers.",3
"I absolutely loved the anime of Cowboy Bebop. This book is set in the same universe with the same characters. Their stories, however, have changed. The way we meet Ed, Faye, Ein, and the history of Spike and Jet are different based on the author's take on the characters. Some might not like this, but I like the new twist on their relationships. Plus the author has added a whole new badguy! Since the TV series is over, it is also like getting all new Bebop stories. I haven't read the rest in this manga series so I don't know how they continue, but if you are dying for more Spike and don't mind the alternate reality, I highly recommend the book!If you don't want the stories to change, consider picking up the Cowboy Bebop series by Hajime Yadate and Yutaka Nanten, ISBN#1931514917, simply called Cowboy Bebop Book 1 etc. These are more like continuing adventures that take place in between what would have been a TV episode.",3

"i like RBL and Black-C a lot. Taydatay is my favorite from 11/5. So this combo made me expect a lot. Production is not as great as I would have thought, but there are some cuts (at least a few from black c) that dont sound too rapmaster keyboard-drum machine style. I liked the title track w/ big mack. taydatay/big mac collabo album would be good. as i said, the lyrics overshadow the production- sean t (he did this title track), ric roc (its hard 2 b-legit) have the best in the bay right now..",3
"I have to say..I just started using this series and thus far, the written portion is great! But how could I have known it required a very expensive CD? I sure wish that part had been stated before I ordered this series.",3
"Offutt's strength is his prose and characterization, but his narrative is a little off here. A shame really, because his first memoir was solid all around. He himself admits to not knowing what the Holocaust story has to do with his own return to Kentucky and, quite frankly, neither do I. It seemed thrown in as maudlin filler and was blatantly incongruous.The ending seemed rushed too. ""I am saying good-bye"" and ""I want to stay. I am ready to leave."" I know he can do better and the rest of the book proves that he can do better.Still though, there are some stylistic gems here. Offutt uses words and characters wonderfully. You'll love them and understand them. He's a very solid writer and students learning to write creatively can learn a lot from his craft--overtly and subtly.Worth a read.",3
"Three stars may be generous for the game. There is really only one way to consistently score: take the ball right to the hoop while using the ""juke"" moves. Short range jump shots don't work. Post-up game: forget it. Anything resembling a real basketball game: forget it. But if you do take the ball to the hoop and use the juke moves and you have one of the star players it is unstoppable. Play LeBron: he'llo score every time. If you like a pure arcade-style game then you might like this one.",3

If your not a cyclist you might not find this book is for you.",3

"Among Arnold's early movies, this one stands out for the eclectic supporting cast. His early movies were remarkedly free of any acting on his part; I suspect he was still learning English then. But one way to make him look better is to hire nonactors, or miscast semiactors. Enter Wilt and Grace. (Later, Richard Dawson). This is as much a collectible as Terminator 2.",3
"""Conan the Destroyer "", this disappointing sequel to the entertaining and well made ""Conan the Barbarian"" is an example of what happens when studios attempt to broaden the appeal of a movie for younger audiences. This movie tries to inject more slapstick humor and includes ""big name"" stars (Grace Jones and Wilt Chamberlain), while sacrificing much of the story line, effective characters, and raw action that made the first movie so watchable. The special effects were also weaker and often seemed out of place, making this a real step backwards.If it wasn't for ""Arni"", it wouldn't be worth the price of the DVD. Recommended only for die hard Conan and ""Arni"" fans.",3
"After the succesful Conan The Barbarian the inevitable sequel took part 2 years after the first.This time Conan the Cimmerian(Schwarzenegger) must find with the help of a virgin princess a jewel that leads to the horn of a god Dagoth which a evil queen(Douglas) needs to give to their kingdom all the power of the world.Followed by the sorcerer of the first film(Mako) by a cure thief(Lester) and a agile warrior(Jones) they must face all the dangers of such a risky mission.With dign special and visual effects and the final monster made by the creator of ET the film has a whole dign production better than italian imitations(Ator) or cheesy and camp productions(Red Sonja,Barbarian Queen) and at least is entertaining and pleased to watch.",3
"The last batman movie was great, this was plain ordinary. Overrated and far too generously reviewed.",3
"this blu ray its anything you would expect i recomended and people should buy the box set too, thnkx e",3
"Had eagerly awaited this one. Great movie, but the image quality was in no way up to BluRay standards. Not having seen it in the theater, I don't know whether this was by design.That said... Oscar-worthy.",3
"Everybody knows the movie is fantastic, and I'm sure the transfer to blu-ray is equally as impressive, but I received this product with a giant puncture mark through the case. There was no damage to the box, so I assume it had to be due to how the movie was handled in the warehouse. It literally looks like somebody attacked it with a screwdriver. Luckily it didn't damage the disks, but regardless it's still annoying.",3
I absolutely love this movie. I hate paying $25 for blu ray discs though as even with my top notch equipment it's just not that much better. I already have two versions of the dvd.. yeah i like it that much and wanted the blu ray basically cause the price was right. However i was disappointed as when i got it there was a golf ball type divet in the blu ray which wouldn't allow it to play. I unfortunately had to return it. I am giving this item a 3 star for midway though because i received fast service and it was extremely easy to return at no cost to me.So yes quality control sucked that this got out as it clearly couldn't play for anyone but Amazon customer service support was top notch for returns.,3
"I wasnt planning on watching this movie but decided to last minute. I saw it on the huge screen at IMAX.. special effects and action was great.. heath ledger was fantastic in the role as the Joker.. i had only seen him in romance and drama roles before this, but he really suprised me with this one. He really went out leaving his mark.If you're not a fan of his, or of the Batman series, you might not become a fan from watching this movie, but i do recommend giving it a chance at least. Its a pretty good storyline and even a bit scary towards the end.. i only bought the dvd for a friend, but i wouldnt mind watching it again.Definately watch it if you're a Heath Ledger fan though.. he was awesome in his role and you will love him in this one.",3
"This was a solid movie, but way too long. It was as if they kept putting in another scheme for the Joker to pull off...then another...then another. Why? They could have cut 30 minutes from the movie easily.I have to say that I was expecting much more from Heath. While his performance was certainly solid, it was by no means the oscar winning portrayal I was hoping to see. And for him to have said that the role was so disturbing that it was causing insomnia and a lot of his problems--he clearly had some emotional issues then, because the Joker was actually a lot more tame that I thought he was going to be. All in all a solid movie, but it was too long and over-hyped.",3
When i hit the play button i watched so horrible video quality for a release that this one..i felt ripped off.The Sound- The sound is very clear and crispy. No hiss sound or cracking sound.Extras- well another let down here.,3
"My star rating is for the BluRay, not the film itself.As much as I love this movie (and I do love this movie), I had to settle for the standard DVD version because of the sudden aspect ratio changes for the IMAX footage. I found this amazingly distracting and it constantly kept throwing me out of the movie. Hopefully someday they'll release another BluRay version that has the option to disable the IMAX ratio switch and I'll be able to upgrade, but until then I must make do with 480p when I watch this wonderful film. It's a shame, too, because other than the annoying ratio swapping the film looks amazing on BD.",3
that must have been the studios motto when they made the standard dvd. This has to be the worst transfer I have seen in modern film making. I am absolutely perplexed why this film was not made in DTS except as others have pointed out that perhaps they are trying to push Blu Ray.Its a great film ( I saw it three times in IMAX) but this dvd is a disappointment. We deserved better.,3
"Everyone knows about the movies that are very well written, casted, and directed. They are awarded and phrased films we've placed on our movie shelves for good looks and not show (There Will Be Blood, No Country For Old Men, Atonement, Titanic, Broke back Mountain, Batman Returns, may i continue...) . I have added The Dark Knight to the movie I must own, because it was great (and Heath Ledger died before it's release and has made it history), but i will never suffer through the three hours of talk talk talk and batman's boring humiliation AGAIN!!! EVER!",3
"Batman tries to destroy organized crime in Gotham. The Joker is the adversary here in this sequel to Batman Begins. It was one of the top two highest grossing films ever along with Spider Man 3. Comic fan or not, Batman has his origins in the 1930s with Detective Comics, hence the DC company. Nightwing was the original Robin. The secind Robin was killed by The Joker in A Death in the Family. In the Knightfall, Knightquest and Knightsend series in the 90s, Batman is crippled by a new villain named Bane. His latest protege Azrael dones an upgraded costume in his sit in as Batman. In Zero Hour Nightwing regrets Batman didn't take him as the fill in. They brought in Batgirl in like 1989.",3
"I really enjoyed Batman Begins and looked forward to this movie, but I was disappointed. The story line is great, the acting superb, but it is extremely dark and violent. I think it could all have been done as effectively without all the gratuitous ugliness. The depiction of the prosecutor after his burns was not believable and better suited to a horror movie. A very good concept taken too far.",3
"The acting was great!!! The movie, though, was very dark. I like a little more light!! Heath Ledger will be missed!!!!!!",3
"Apart from the mask, there isn't that much special about this limited edition. No audio commentary is my big complaint. However, the Batman Unmasked featurette is an unexpected pleasure, as it psychoanalyzes Batman in all his incarnations. I suspect there's another limited edition coming with more bells and whistles. Me, I bought this because I loved the movie and this set cost as much as the regular two-DVD edition.",3
"I wil not get into a review of the film itself, other than to say its an outstanding movie...far transending the genre into a truly imaginative frightening film. The DVD on the other hand is insultingly bad. Poor resolution...artifacts...edge enhancement....lots of compression...poor black levels...etc. Its dvds like this that make some believe that studios, especially Warrner Brothers are intentionaly degrading the potental quality on standard DVD to help push Blu Ray. Until this dvd I thought that was some paranoid delusion on the part of some film fans, but this DVD is so shoddy ...especially for such a film, that I can almost believe that they may be on to something. Shame on Warner Brothers for this truly sub standard DVD. I am a television producer, so I know what a DVD can and should look like...and this is NOT it!!!",3
"Yes, Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is an excellent film without question. BUT, shame on Warner Bros. for releasing such a not-so-special 2disk special edition for it's initial release onto DVD. NO INTERVIEWS WITH HEATH LEDGER? Or most of the cast and crew for that matter. Instead you get a scant pathetic 2 ""making off"" tiny featurettes, 6 lame episodes of ""Gotham Tonight"" the seperated IMAX scenes, and some yawn trailers and photo galleries. They're obviously saving the real good stuff for next year's release after Ledger's won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his amazing portrayal of the Joker.So yes, the film rocks, this release sucks though, so Please...be Patient.",3
"Normally I'm pretty satisfied with my OtterBox purchases, but this one was a bit disappointing. Because the glitter case is clear, it's not made of a hard plastic like the others. For some reason I thought it would be a little harder but it's a flexible plastic. Also, as a side note, don't be dumb like me and use acetone or nail polish remover around this. I melted the side of it within the first couple of days of having it.",4
Love this kit as it is cheap but feels solid. It is easy to use and is nice and sharp out the box.,4
"So far so good. Very easy to install, easy cleaning, super smooth operation and great water flow.",4
"This is a pretty sturdy, safe alternative to the traditional mandolin (though still use caution). Has several functions that all work decently for the cost. Good for a college student like I was - just starting out and wanting food simply chopped (not pretty). Bought it a while ago and kept it for about two years.It can have trouble cutting through tough veggies like potatoes and onions, so I needed to cut them in halves or quarters to cut them. Food gets very easily stuck, and is very difficult to clean out in the sink. Not sure if it’s dishwasher friendly, as I don’t have one.",4
"I love the nesting feature, but I am constantly worried about using a very high temperature while cooking. According to the instructions it strongly suggests to use a medium flame. Also, there is a weird grayish residue between washes on the bottom exterior of the pans. I think other than scratching each other that’s the reason for the felt dividers that came with the set. I feel like it should have one more large pot lid added so you can use multiple pots simultaneously. The cold storage lids don’t snap on, so they don’t feel secure when storing food in the fridge. Easy to clean both by hand and in a dishwasher.",4
"These have heavy enough bottom to not warp when cooking at medium-high heat. Come out clean from the dishwasher. As long as you don't dunk them in cold water when they are hot, these will stay good for a while.They are good for making omelets and sunny side up eggs; or even fried potatoes for a small family. Big enough well for deglazing and reduction of sauces, but obviously you don't want to make a bechamel sauce in these pans.",4
"I have a go-to set of mixing bowls that I love. But sometimes, especially during holidays and large cooking get togethers, I want to use a different set so I am not forced to wash and dry my set of 4 so often. So, in preparation for a large gathering weekend, I bought this set. I used many of the bowls and lids for the mass cooking adventure. I was pleased with the sizes and appearance of the bowls. I was able to use them for serving some dishes too. The lids worked well. I did not use the shredding feature so I cannot comment on that.I will note that the bowls are not thick or very sturdy. I hand washed all pieces so that they would not be warped. I saw in other comments that the kids warped over time. By hand washing, I suspect that won’t happen to mine. They are not thick, I emphasize. I do not plan to use these as my sturdy, everyday pieces but they will serve well as my secondary set. The metal is shiny but I suspect it will dull and scratch over time but that is just aesthetics. I love the bottoms as they do not move when mixing. For the money, this is a great set of bowls. I would not use them daily but I recommend them for back up prep and storing.",4
Nice sharp sturdy knife! Damascus pattern is not as visible in person,4
"Talk about being duped, read everything about this knife and was convinced it was made in Japan & sold in America, but alas, yes, sold in America but ""MADE IN CHINA"". I'm really getting sick & tired of this crap, AMAZON you need to lift your game & demand that these sellers display where the item is made!!!!!!! When I find an item that I'm tempted to buy it is the first thing I look for ""where it's made"" & if it's made in China then that's a NO GO for me because I've had to much CRAP from them & the quality is disgraceful, so if an item cannot display where it's made then I'll just move along or go without.",4

"Scissors are nice quality and do well cutting but have limited use due to difficulty of cleaning. These have limited applications because they don’t come apart for thorough cleaning. Any raw meat packaging or uncooked items that can easily transmit bacteria should be avoided as the bacteria can get trapped where shears are joined. Soaking or dishwasher cleaning ultimately results in rust as water cannot be totally dried. Because of this , they’re not truly all purpose and I will need to invest in another pair that can come apart.",4
they work great and are solid! sometimes they come defective where the red string is glued and it ripps the bags.,4
I wanted one with a stand to set up when entertaining a large group for a grab and go beverage option. The height is below waist level. It is folding table height. It did the job.,4
"Easy to clean. Does a nice job air frying and baking. I haven’t used all the features yet but so far it’s worked great. The only issue is the toast feature, which really doesn’t do a good job but no toaster oven does anyway. I use a toaster instead. Nice product.",4
"This quilt is not very thick nor is the nap very thick. It definitely has a nap, but it is very low and doesn’t dramatically change color when you smooth it against the grain. The loden color I picked is dark enough to pair with my purple throw pillows as my other comforters are dark purple. Because it is not very thick, it lays flat and offers a clean look on the bed. The shams are simple without frilly edges, but I like the look. The quilt is very thin; it does not really feel as if it is filled with anything, but it has a lot of weight to it so that it is sufficient for winter use. The California King size has plenty of length and width to cover my bed and even the top of my bed skirt - please note this quilt does not come with a matching bed skirt - so it looks smooth and finished when the bed is made. I do wish this set came in a dark purple and not the lavender they offer as I’d get that color in a heartbeat as I prefer this thinner but still heavy style of bed covering. I also like that it is basically the same on both sides so that you can reverse it and it won’t look “wrong”. And the fact that it can be machine washed and dried makes it a good option for someone looking for a flatter, less puffy look for their bed. My only gripe is that it wrinkles a bit.",4
This velvet quilt is nice. It is a but thinner than I hoped but it is nice and soft. My husband likes that it is thin but I get much colder than him. It washed and dried well when I got it. I didn’t notice any issue with stitching on my set. I think it is a nice snuggly quilt especially for those with texture sensitivities.,4
"Smells good, lasts a long time, calming.",4
Didn’t think I would like these as much as I do but they’re really nice and bright. Bright enough where I can sit in the office comfortably at night without the need of turning on the room lights. These also help with out with eye strain too that I’ve noticed when using the computer for long periods of time.Getting them up and running was a breeze and it also works just as well with Alexa assistant. Plenty of preset color options to choose from or you can make your own through the Govee App.Only reason I docked a point is because the double sided adhesive strips provided with the panels are abysmal. They lasted for a day before they started falling off the wall one by one. Had to order some 3M mounting tape to get these to stick so fair warning there.Overall I’m pleased with these and many other Govee products. Way more affordable solution compared to the other alternatives. I’d definitely recommend these.,4
"The lights are really easy to install with the app guiding you, it get nice and bright and works well with google home. I just Wish the app interface was a bit more user friendly and accessible.",4
This Reed diffuser has pleasant scent. I like how it has a decorative flower pattern not just sticks. It can be put in any room and the entire room smells nice. It comes in a nice box so it’s even perfect to gift to friends or family.,4
"I recently purchased the Reed Diffuser Set (Starshine1), and I’m really enjoying the fresh, pleasant scent it adds to my home. The fragrance is light and uplifting, with a nice balance that isn’t overpowering — it creates a calming atmosphere whether in the living room, bedroom, or even the bathroom. It’s the perfect scent for daily use and definitely enhances the ambiance in any room.The design of the diffuser itself is lovely and fits well with my home decor. I also appreciate the rattan reeds, which are stylish and functional. The aromatherapy effect is subtle yet effective, making it perfect for spaces where you want a gentle, consistent fragrance without it being too strong.My only minor critique is that I wish the scent-drawing straws (the reeds) were a bit larger. I’ve noticed that the scent doesn’t seem to diffuse as strongly as I expected, and I think larger reeds would help draw the fragrance out more effectively and fill the room with a more noticeable aroma. That said, it still works well for a more subtle scent and is a great option if you prefer a lighter fragrance.Overall, this is a lovely diffuser set with a great fragrance, and it’s a perfect decorative gift as well. I just wish the reeds were slightly thicker for better scent diffusion. Still, I’m very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others looking for a nice, relaxing room scent.",4
"First off, they are much smaller than I thought they’d be. I’ve only used one, as I needed something to store my towels on in my bathroom. It’s easy enough to install but even following the instructions, it ended up lopsided. No one notices but me..but it bugs me. I don’t like how flimsy it feels. I wouldn’t trust it for anything heavy.",4
"Instructions were clear, and it was nice that it specified the size of drill bits needed. But with the included hardware there is quite a bit of vertical flex to the bracket once mounted as it comes with countersunk screws which the bracket wasn't made for. After finding one of my shelves in particular was too saggy, I bought new screws with wide flat heads (see picture) and they are much more secure.It would also be nice if there was an included way to secure the shelf on the bracket - it just slides on and off. I'm considering whether I want to glue it, or perhaps inset a neodymium magnet on the shelf back so it would hold to the bracket.",4
Love the design and the fact that it melts the candle without getting smokey or sutty. Much safer than an actual lit candle. Just be careful when handling once it's turned on. Keep out of reach of children and pets.,4
My only complaint is that the little basket for the toothbrushes is skinnier metal than the rest and it doesn't stay on the hooks as well. The rest of them are perfect and look really nice. They hold a lot more than what we have to put in them.,4
"These wooden art signs are each a different size. When you store them, they nest inside each other. They are meant to be displayed on a table-top. They do not have hooks on the back to hang, but there is room to add a narrow one if you wanted to. The graphics are simple, in red and blue on a white background, but perfect for baseball (especially if you have an All-Stars display!). The slogans are those that baseball fans all know and love and are pretty timeless. My son is on two baseball teams, so I display these on the sideboard in our foyer with his team photos during the season.",4
I have this wreath on the front door and it will work for the summer. I have other wreaths for the other seasons. I like the way it looks and am pleased with it. I have to agree with other reviewers that the bow is very flimsy. I haven’t changed it yet but will do so in the future. Other than that it’s a nice looking wreath at a good price.,4
I have placed this near a window and the light shines through beautifully.,4
Very cute but smaller than expected.,4
Awesome pc for gaming gets around 240-300 fps in fortnite and never freezes all of a sudden. I recommend as for a first pc-,4
Wireless charger and headset plug dosent work other than that great pc,4
I like the support team response to a small issue. The repair was swift and great workmanship. My son loves his gaming computer and the lights around the computer match his room decor.,4
"Bought this for my 10 year old son. It is fairly fast out of the box. Runs his current games (Minecraft, Roblox, etc..) with zero issues. Looking forward to him getting into more robust games in the future so I can teach him how to upgrade his computer. This gives us a solid base that fits all his current needs and also allows us to build as we go. Big bonus is the looks. He absolutely loves the looks of this machine (little too flashy for my taste).",4
"it’s definitely worth the buy for the money. I’ve been playing on it for about an hour and have had no lag when it comes to opening things downloading things or even watching videos. The only thing that it can’t do (which is why i gave it 4 stars) and if you’re looking for this don’t buy, but it does not record gaming videos very well, which is what I wanted when I originally purchased, but I’m still happy with the product because it runs most of my games very well.",4
"The pc is good, third gen I5 performs better than expected even tho ddr3 ram starts to show its age, its still reliable. I only added a low profile card, The GTX 1050Ti from Zotac. It can run GTA Online between 50 to 75 fps (I cant see more beacause of the 75hz monitor), Fortnite runs perfectly on Performance mode, high settings, expect a few stutters for the few first games. For the E-sports titles such as Valorant and CSGO you'll have no problem running them. Its a pretty good computer for the price to performance ratio. I bought my gtx1050ti from Facebook Marketplace for 65 CAD$. BTW, I bought a different mouse with side buttons from Walmart for $6",4
"My previous desk only accommodated laptop. I was gifted a PC and needed to find something bigger but simple, as I had limited space. This fit that description perfectly. It's sturdy, sleek and affordable. My favorite perk is the built in power connections that allow USB and prongs. The lights are great and I like to match then with my keyboard. Very happy with this buy.",4
"Easy to build, took me about an hour total, instructions are very easy to follow. The desk itself is pretty sturdy, and holds all of my gaming setup no problem, with a good amount of arm room.I would’ve liked the desk to to be one single board instead of 3 smaller ones you combine to make the desk. Also the shelf to hold my computer is a tad bit small, with about an inch of my computer not being supported by the shelf it’s supposed to sit on, but I don’t think it will fall off unless it is kicked or bumped hard.The LED lights do not come with a sticky back, and the ones provided aren’t very good. So I’d recommend going and buying some double sided tape beforehand!Otherwise I am very happy with the product and the outcome! Great value for its price point.",4
"Bought this mic strictly because I was in need of a mic, mic arm stand etc. But what's even better is that some of my friends have the more expensive microphones like blue yeti and the 100-200 dollar mics for podcasts/recording music etc. and this one is right there with them I feel like. Maybe i'll notice more fractional differences down the road but as a overall mic, its great.The voice quality is very clear, it sounds crisp, no cutting out, no distortion, just a smooth voice with very little background noise. I use it for gaming, talking with friends on discord, even recording some vocals to see what my voice can really do lol. I guess I'm a singer now! It actually sounds better than I thought.It has soft touch buttons to turn volume of the mic up and down, holding it mutes. It just feels like such a satisfying touch.The design is clean, its the same size all around basically, doesn't feel outdated, too big and cheap, it feels like $100+ mic made with good durable parts and nice edges. Love the basically all black design.Overall, like I was saying, now that I have the mic, I would have just paid that much for the mic itself but since I was in need of the mic arm stand mostly, I went with this. Also though, I got a shock mount which actually is nice for not hearing any noise from things touching my desk, etc. I didn't know the value of this until I tried with and without it. The mic arm stand is nice, does exactly what it needs to do, use to have a super cheap 10 dollar one and it just wouldn't move smooth and this one just feels like a crane and its nice.Definitly will buy again, going to pick another one up soon for my girlfriend, built her a computer recently as well and it will be a good combo to have.",4
It's a Christmas gift for my daughter so it hasn't been opened but the pricing and shipping were great,4
"Shipment was delayed supposed to come in on sunday came on Thursday. Did come in thought UPS not amazon. At first of putting in power cord and HDMI cord ( HDMI cord did work) it would not turn on, but after inserting and plugging the power cord of the xbox off and on several times it did eventually work and then turned on. When it turned on it did restart itself twice but after worked completely normal. After all that no issues came from the xbox. Games like college football and Jedi Survivor has worked smoothly and download speed runs fast. Actually would recommend especially during prime day. A Xbox S 1TB was 350 no shipping while this on prime day in 2024 was 400 with shipping so definitely worth but can be risky with all the other reviews in place. Risk it though because this is way more worth it.",4
"If you want the new gen Xbox’s but can’t get the X, this is for you.",4
"The media could not be loaded. I bought this as a surprise for my son, as I was redoing his media room. Not only is it aesthetically pleasing, but super multifunctional. He can charge many things on this device. We love the lights on it. You can keep it one solid color. You can change it to a rotation of the colors too if you like. This has been great for minimizing cords and chargers and cables. Also, it keeps my son from just tossing his headphones down in a chair. This actually helps them last longer.",4
"Well, I wasn't planning on getting an 8th gen console. I was really in the state of thought, that it wouldn't be much of an upgrade from 7th gen to 8th, like it was jumping from 6th gen to 7th, or 5th gen to 6th. But. I had to reconsider since there where games coming out for the 8th gen consoles I really wanted, so I went on ahead and pulled the trigger. You only live once, amiright? My opinion about the leap from 7th gen to 8th is not that huge, is still the same. It really isn't that much of an upgrade. Just the likes of Xbox One and PS4 has smoother textures and graphics, and can handle more AI and activity than their predecessors. But hey, we're reaching the climax of how much we can do with this technology so it's a given.Now, that I have my views of 8th generation out the way, lemme get to the main course. The Xbox One.I enjoy it. I'm still trying to work around it and get to know it. Know the little new features that is. It's kind of like a 360, but with more. More downloading than the 360 as well. Just to play a DVD, I had to download an app just to make it work. I know. It isn't about watching movies, it's about the gaming. But still. Since previous systems just let you pop in the disk and play your movies, without having to worry installing features is kind of the point. Pop movie in Xbox. Movie plays. Pop movie into 360, movie play. Pop movie into Xbox One. Opps! You've gotta download an app for that! I know it's free. I know it's quick. But it's still stupid. Apps also have a knack for freezing sometimes. Like the youtube app. I'll be in the middle of watching a video, and it freezes. And I can't shut the tab down. The only thing left to do is to shut down the console and turn it back on. Scrolling threw the dashboard has a bit of a lag to it vs the 360. Maybe do to more plastered content? I don't know. I know. Stupid thing to nitpick about. Grain of salt people. But I'm sure these things won't matter with a few more patches and updates.Now that I've got the kinks out the way. Lemme get to the meaty part. The gaming experience. I haven't put too much playtime into it. But so fair, I say it's fun factor is very good. I had a good time playing Forza 6. More games are on the way so I can give this system some more playtime and open it up. This is going to be short since I just the console a few days ago and I need to get more in depth. But so far. No problems with the gaming aspect. Kind of funny thinking back in 2013, people where saying the Xbox One wasn't ""for the gamers"". It most certainly is.physical durability.Unlike last generation, within I year I would start hearing horror stories of reliability issues with the consoles of old. 2 years has already passed since these consoles had been out, I haven't heard any REALLY bad problems with these consoles yet. A few PS4's and Xbox One's bricked at launch, but only a slim few. The rest of time was smooth sailing for these consoles. Sure. The Xbox One isn't the prettiest looking thing in the world, but certainly isn't the ugliest. Like the original Xbox, this thing was built to last. There are huge vents everywhere. From the top to the sides, so no worries about overheating from hours of gameplay. Plus, the thing is really quiet. It doesn't make a peep. Unlike the old Xbox's, the One is so quiet you could hear a fly fart. The 360's fan roars more than Mufasa from The Lion King. I love how I can finally have some peace and quiet, when I have a console on. That's a welcomed change. Controller is not that shabby either. Although the 360 controller will always be my personal favorite. The 360 controller feels better than the One's by leaps and bounds. But when not compared to the 360 controller, the One's controller is really comfy and fitting. No huge complaints there.The verdict.I've only had the Xbox One for a few days, and I'm already loving it. It's not perfect. But it's not horrible like some people want you to believe either. (I'm looking at you PS4 fanboys.) The Xbox One is a fine investment that will give its owner hours of fun playtime for casual and hardcore gamers alike. Don't be expecting huge graphical leaps with these consoles. But don't think it's under powered either. The Xbox One certainly has redeemed itself, after it's horror show of a launch two years ago. So many people expected it to fail, but here we are. People are warming up to it and nodding in respect for Microsoft and the Xbox One turning around for the better.4/5",4
"I've been obsessed with it since it arrived. The seemless user interface and sleek design is absolutely captivating. From 10 percent, the phone will take 4 hours to charge if you have a regular adapter. It will hold a charge for a great amount of time. Pairs very well with Echo Buds, which I also highly recommend for audiophiles who look for balance between their music and their surroundings. The phone does come alone, without the promo for the $100 gift card, so double check your cart to make sure you chose the correct option.Update on having the phone for two months:This one of the best phones out there! The functionality is superb. However, it can heat up when fast charging and when using a couple of high functioning apps at a time. Fast charge take an hour and a half. The phone does not slow down, but the heat makes the phone a little uncomfortable to hold after, even with a case.",4
"I got this smartphone as an alternative to a.) Getting my iPhone 12 pro scrubbed.b.) buying another iPhone.To explain, I got hacked while using my iPhone and my bank wanted me to get it scrubbed in case there was some sort of malware on it. So rather than driving 40 minutes and paying $190 to get that done along with the paperwork certifying it was done, I just bought a brand new Samsung A-15 from Amazon. It performs well and satisfied my bank. Price is probably the .ain't factor in my purchasing this phone. I think I owned a Galaxy S-21 before, and I like this A-15 better. It has no water resistance, one speaker, but it has decent cameras and is fast enough loading internet sites. It's a tad big and heavy, but the + side is a larger screen. There is no inductive charging, but it uses a 25 watt charger that makes charging relatively fast. Also, the battery lasts a long time. I think it's 5000 miliamps. I've had it last over 3 days, so that's a plus. If you are an iOS user and have Apple Mail, that can be challenging, but once you set everything up, it's no big deal.",4
"I received this yesterday and have tried it out for nearly 24 hours now. I will be using this as a back up phone.The pluses.Nice big clear and bright screen.I like the case and the color. It looks and feel quite decent,Good, responsive touchscreen with good colors.Good wifi and bluetooth. On screen keyboard is also easy to use.Large battery, I charged it to 100 % last night and its still at 70%Good sound quality and fairly loud speakers.Negatives.There is some lag but that is in comparison to my “high end” main phone but I consider it to be more than acceptable.The cameras have great colors are appear to be over processed.If this was for use as my main shooter, it would not be acceptable but for the bargain price, and considering that this is budget phone, both front and rear cameras will suffice.Not too keen on the side finger print reader, it does work and actually responds quite fast, I don’t care for the location.So as a budget back up phone, there are some negatives but I can live with them all.Not; the first two photos were taken with the rear came at high resolution. The third was taken with the front facing camera. The last two were taken indoors in a restaurant setting on high resolution.I quite like this phone. I had been considering a 5 year old phone for a back up…. It still had really good specs but I was concerned about the battery and how much longer it would work. Also there would not be any security updates on an older phone but this is from 2024 and has already done several updates since I first powered it on, and it is due to be upgraded to Android 14 later this summer. ( I mention this because there are surely other folks looking for a budget back up phone.)Also, since I don’t play any games, I cant offer any opinions in that respect.For a back up phone, its ideal and I recommend it!",4
A budget phones serves all your needs for a second phone. Bit slow.,4
"Except the provided wireless controller. The left control stick was not functioning correctly and the controller would shut off on it's own.No problem as i had perfectly functioning controllers on hand.The important part was the console itself which happened to function perfectly. No issues or hiccups. I can now enjoy my 360 games again as my old console has been dead for several months,...though it provided over 11 years of service....i hope this renewed unit can provide the same.",4
A liked it but was a little on the small side and only red color.,4

"We recently purchased a 1934 Spanish Eclectic that needs not only restoration of it's former architectural integrity, but an addition to make the home work for us. This book was a good choice to provide us with a photographic ""library"" of Spanish-style homes to reference. I do wish there had been more devotion to the ""casitas"" section of middle-class homes and less to buildings dedicated to government or business; and perhaps more photographs of interiors. But it's still a great find and a wonderful addition for anyone who collects either books on architecture in general or on California architecture specifically.",4
"Hard to find these days, but worth picking up. Lots of hidden goodies on here. Can't go wrong with Sepultura's ""Chaos B.C."". And the run from Crawlspaces ""My Ruin"" all the way up to Cubanate's ""Oxyacetylene"" is full of awesome. Alien Factory's ""Higher"" is one fast paced track that fits at home at any rave. And Crystal Method's ""Come2gether"" is good not matter what mood im in.If you avoid the warts (Like G/Z/R's 'Outworld'), you have a good time with this CD.",4
Timely service and as described. I really prefer to know the editions publish date as I seek issues from 1999 and newer if possible.,4
Escape from Alcatraz depicts the full history of this infamous prison stronghold. It reflects how life was on the Rock and details the circumstances when and how 23 convicts attempted or succeeded in escaping from the island prison - the latter few never to be ever seen or heard of again. If you are interested in Alcatraz you need go no further than reading this book - it is really that good !,4
This is a beautifully conceived and photographed book of faces of people of mixed races who are wholly American. On the facing page is a handwritten paragraph of how they see themselves. It's wonderful.,4
"Great book -- I just wish it was longer! I gave a copy to my sister, who has two daughters adopted from China -- so although her kids are 100% Asian, it is likely she will have Hapa grandchildren. I also gave a copy to a friend whose husband is from the Phillipines and has 3 beautiful Hapa children --- they liked the book so much, they bought copies for their children and grandchildren. Beautiful photography, and wonderful insights into being part Asian, 100% Hapa, in an anglo world. My favorite quote is from the boy who said he is 'part Danish, but I usually don't tell people that because they think I am a pastry'.",4
"I am 100% Hapa, i was born and raised in Hawaii and i am very familar with the term and pleased to see it making its way into mainstream culture. I bought this book as a fathers day gift for my husband who is always asking why our first son looks nothings like him (he is Irish) and i am Hawaiian-Irish-Portugese.I only wish that the title of the book was more inclusive of Hawaiian and Pacific islanders who are also Hapa and originated the term.",4
"This mirror fit our mirror frame perfectly; however, the first time that door was shut it fell out and shattered. We used the adhesive system that came with it. Next time we'll use gorilla glue instead!",4
"The book overall is quite out-dated but it's message still has a singe of relevance. While world history is a fascinating subject, the history of your ancestors is even more fascinating. A powerful message that should not be forgotten.",4
"Before picking this book up to read I was aware of the knowledge I needed on African American's in the Education system. After reading it I felt empowered and sad. Empowered because now I had a little more knowledge and saddened because now I know what was kept from me all my school years. It amazes me how we were not taught any of our history not even in college. It also amazes me how people got away with not educating us.Dr. Carter shows us how 30 years ago the system was designed to keep us ignorant and as experiments. Quote from Dr. Woodson ""Negroes, being objects of charity, have received them cordially and have done what they were required."" To this day they are still using the same system but I think we are smarter now and know where the resources are to get what we need.Reviewed by Missy",4
"I am a twenty-four year old African American man and I read this book six years ago, and even at that young age I found it ""On point"". Dr. Woodson wrote this book over 60 years ago and his observations of social and educational conditions hold true to this day. This book was my introduction to my continuing studies of African American history, and I recommend that anyone beginning their studies begin with this book. There will be many instances when you will nod your head in agreement with what is stated, and other times when you will learn things about your own behaviors that you could not previously understand. The only reason that I couldn't give this book five stars is because it is a scholarly text and it is a little difficult for less sophisticated readers.",4
"The negative, incredulous readers/reviewers should read Psychiatry: The Ultimate Betrayal by Bruce Wiseman as the companion to this book. It very well may change your mind about your opinion of this work and others like it.",4
I stumbled upon this book while researching a different subject. Wow! Everyone should read this book. So enlightening. People of all educational levels will benefit from the wisdom of Mr. Woodson.,4
"I found this book to be very informatative and I was pleasantly surprised by all the valueable information that was within the pages of this book. What impressed me the most was the wealth of information concerning the African American people, especially the male gender. I brought this book because I am studying the Hebrew roots of the Christian faith and this book has clarified many questions I had about why we such a hated race of people. I wish I could buy this book for ever black male and female who is not proud of who he or she is because of a lack of knowledge of our heritage, which has been stolen from us way back in the 1600's which is actually 15th century and has been replaced with the Europeans. If you have no identity than you will become what others say your are. This book should be taught to every black elementary student as a History course so that they will come to know who they really are and where they come from.",4
"Overall, the HomeRight Auto Wash Stick works well on flat surfaces but if your car has wheel well mouldings, fender flares, spoilers, air dams, roof racks, or just about anything not flat, I find it hard to get those areas. And many places can't be gotten to no matter what. It earns a 4 star because where it can be used it works pretty good. If your car is an easy car to wash then perhaps you will really like it. Mine is a hard one to wash so when I get done, I let it dry then go back and wash the areas I missed by hand. Even with that, it's still easier and quicker than washing the whole thing with a sponge. Plus the long handle makes it easier to do the roof without stretching or reaching and the lower areas without stooping. It feels a little light duty and I worry how long it will last, but if it holds up well I would probably buy another.",4
"The backing for the mitt has a slight curve and fairly soft flex that does a surprisingly good job on and around door trim. Uses more washing solution than hand washing, but that is the only negative.",4
This puzzle was an impulse buy. But was well worth it. The pieces are large and on knobs so my little one was able to use it easily. There are only three pieces so its easy to store and keep it all together.,4

"I purchased this product 2 years ago and still use it now and then. The smooth rollers are comfortable to grip w/o over heating your hair and fingers. The rollers form a medium curl and the clip helps smooth out frizzies. I give this product 4 stars only because the clips do not hold tight enough. I find them easy to loosen or fall out even if I am sitting still. I have long, thick, wavy hair so the roller clips may hold thinner hair better; although, that may be the ones that end up with the crease.",4
"This is perhaps the 5th set of electric style rollers that I have owned. It's probably the best, in that it heats up very quickly, which is, after all, why I use this type of product. It also has the same flaw that most electric rollers have, which no fool proof way of fastening them so that they stay in the hair. This product has a squeeze clip that fastens over the roller, once it is wrapped with your hair. It also heats up, to transfer heat to the hair from both the inside and the out. It also will leave a ""crease"" in the lock of hair, from where is clips on. No way to avoid it. I use the rollers along with a curling brush, to smooth out the crease in the front, which fixes the problem for me. Meanwhile, if you use electric rollers in general, this set is quick, and delivers a firm curl in a reasonably short period of time.",4
"I love this! Works great and is so easy to use.The big selling point for me is IT HEATS UP FAST! My old unit takes FOREVER to heat up. I just can't wait that long in the AM so I haven't used it for a long time. This heats up in less than 2 minutes.There are more than enough rollers for my hair and I found it easy to wrap my hair around them. My hair doesn't snag on these rollers at all. The clips hold my hair perfectly and after about 10 minutes I take everything off, I spray my hair and I have a head of beautiful bouncy curls.And this thing is going to last for a long time as it's very well made and high quality.But, there's no way I can keep it on my bathroom counter. It takes up a bit more space than I have free. So, I set it up on a shelf and that works fine.I appreciate having a space in the back of the unit for the plug. No more dangling cords!I'm really happy with this.",4
"Anthony Robbins is a powerful presenter. And he has a lot of practical good advice in these CDs. They are a bit pricey but...I found it useful to play each CD twice, really absorb what he is saying. I also try to go back every two or three months for a refresher session. And don't forget to keep the daily journal he recommends.If you are serious and put in the time, it will help you. It's a way of life not a one shot experience. It takes practice and commitment to implement his ideas, to succeed.So what else is new?Bottom line: this set is a useful self-improvement tool. But be sure to devote the necessary time to incorporate the ideas into your thinking and your actions.Good luck!",4
"Use to like him when I listened, is good for getting you fired up. Not sure what to think of him getting divorced after all his marital bliss. Oh well its a concept that if you stick with some good things may happen!",4

"This book provides introductory passages that illuminate the art of Tai Chi Chuan, and set a beginner on a path to cultivate internal energy. Translations of famous masters take up another chapter. The book covers all of the major styles, although the illustrations for each form(except for the simplified form) are probably meant for informative purposes only; they're not detailed enough that the reader could learn the form from studying the illustrations. Including chapters on martial applications, further combative situations involving the gentle art, weapons, meditation and Taoism, this book is probably the most thorough Tai Chi Chuan book out there. I highly recommend it.",4
"I got this cd player because I had such a hard time finding lullibies on tape. I had read the other comments but thought I would give it a try anyway.Bad points- It DOES skip when its hit, so don't hit it. The light IS dim, so what? I want the kids to sleep not see what to get into! The music IS low even on the highest setting, but then again the whole house isn't listening to it.Good points- It plays the whole CD then shuts itself off. (At least mine does!) It uses CDs which can be found ANYWHERE. Its small enough that I can put it on the wall side of my crib and I know my other children CAN'T play with it!! The buttons are a pain to get to, but thats GREAT where kids are concerned, right??As for the batteries, I've had mine a few weeks, play it EVERY night and have yet to replace the batteries.I happen to really like mine. Give it a try, save your receipt and make up your own mind.",4
"I really like this CD player. I do not understand why it has such a low review.*Yes the light is dim but I did not want a bright light. It is a nightlite. It is just fine. I can check on baby and see him fine.*The volume does not get very loud but for what this is designed for it is fine. I put in a lullaby CD and he drifts off to sleep.*The timer function if great.*The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I wish the digital readout and the buttons lite up. It is hard to see in the dark and I do not like to turn on the light to see the buttons and digital read out. Maybe in the next version the manufacture will include this.*As far as the CD's ckipping when hit, I solved that by sliding a piece of foam between the play and the rails of the crib. No there is no space to move at all and it does not skip.***It is not perfect but it does the trick!***",4
"I love my cd player. My baby uses it every time she goes to sleep...at night and for naps. I like it cause it shuts off itself. I gave it 4 stars cause I wish it would play louder,...but it truly is worth buying!",4
"Even tho these crib CD players were manufactured quite a while ago, they are still available; I bought mine at a Goodwill store. It was wonderful when our grandchildren were in cribs, but they still enjoy it when they come to spend the night. I guess it never occurred to me that an infant would need stereo sound. The volume level is sufficient for an child, since the idea is to lull the baby to sleep and not to ruin the child's eardrums. The nightlight is just enough for a child to feel safe, and yet not bright enough to keep him/her awake. Yes, it is difficult to replace the batteries but as any grandparent can tell you, if something is hard to open, give it to a child. I wouldn't want it to be easier, for safety reasons. Our 6 yr old granddaughter is staying the night and is thrilled that I found the missing CD player which I can hook onto a standard headboard.",4
"My husband and I wanted to buy this for our kids to play the lullabye CDs people had given as baby gifts, but we couldn't justify paying $50. I happened to find a used one at a rummage sale for a dollar! Much more reasonable.PROS: plays any CD; good volume control for a crib (a baby doesn't need surround sound to fall asleep); battery compartment is secured well; ""C"" batteries are best as rechargeables for something like this, since it's used every day; optional timer and programming buttons are good to customize baby's routine; dim nightlight is just enough for you see where the pacifier fell while you reset the music in the middle of the night without waking babyCONS: PRICE; CD door takes two hands to open and is noisy; I kind of wish it had a optional wall-mount or desk base for post-crib use",4
I really love this player; the light is just right for a baby; the sound is very good;I can hear it playing in the baby's room from my room at the other end of the house. My only complaint is it is hard to open but in a way that is ok too; we don't want the baby playing with it! I highly recommend this item. I may have to buy another because my 8 year old uses it after the baby is asleep!,4
"I really dont agree with the other reviews on the cd player. I can hear the player on high from a good distance and really only use the player when she is going to sleep, so how high does it have to go? I dont keep it on high as not to keep her awake, and the only issue is the light doesnt shine as bright as I thought. I keep it attached to the crib not near her head either.I dont get what the other reviewers dont get. Mine works great",4
"This book is good at first part, which provides the basic understanding on cryptography. But it is not understandable for the second part on modern algorithms and public key. I still cannot understand the advantage of modern algorithms over the ancient cryptography.The chapter Key Management seems to long for such a small issue, while the modern algorithms seems to short for such a big issue.",4
"If you want an accurate introduction to the concepts and vocabulary of cryptography, this is the book for you. The authors are clearly knowledgeable but manage to make the information provided accessable to the beginner. There are simple examples to acquaint you with some of the principles of coding and breaking codes. This is a complex subject and some of the ideas will take you into deep water. There is an excellent bibliography that one can refer to for more technical details. The book would benefit from a glossary of acronyms as some of the terminology was hard to keep straight. There could have been a little less discussion of key management. Over all a very useful and informative book.",4

"My 2 year old called this a dino and not a dragon and doesn't relate to wood stoves, different era I suppose. But from the first day he reads this 5 times in a row so it must be fun for him. I don't love that ever since he asks for milk and cookies at night...",4
"My four year old enjoys receiving Ladybug magazine in the mail. It has sweet little stories and is somewhat entertaining. However, he much prefers National Geographic Kids and High Five. Not sure whether it's the nature of the content or the style/layout, but it's not the biggest hit in our house.",4
"We just got our first issue of Ladybug Magazine. My 2 1/2 year olds enjoyed it, but I think some of the stories in there are for older children, probably a year older than mine are. That said, the publisher does give a range (2-6, I believe)and I do think that the kids will grow into enjoying all the features of the magazine. Its nice to have something other than Highlights, which the kids also enjoy.",4
I am a primary teacher and I was looking for books to use with my higher readers. This series of books was suggeted to me and I am very thankful. My first graders love them and I am working on buying the complete set.,4
"A group of kids awaits a book signing with their favorite mystery author, Wallis Wallace. But the author never shows, and the kids find it strange. As they follow clues, they think Wallis Wallace has been kidnapped.I like this book because it's pure kid imagination. It's what kids wish would happen. Who didn't want to be part of a mystery crew like on Scooby Doo or this A - Z Mysteries crew? The start to this series is imaginative, fun and keeps you interested.",4
"The best part of this lens is that it is stabilized and f/2.8. I can take had held shots at weddings regardless of the lighting.The downside is that it is not nearly as sharp or high quality as a L lens. It sucks a lot of dust inside which doesn't affect the pictures but could eventually be a mechanical issue. It is not sharp until around f/8 and does not handle contrast or vivid colors as well as L glass.I would recommend buying this if you need to take hand held shots with a zoom, in low light. Otherwise buy a L or a couple primes.",4
Overall it's a very good lens butts for the price make sure you really look before you buy these lengths I'm not upset that I bought them because I do video shooting but for that money it's not worth it it got better and cheaper lens out there that gives you the same type of quality,4
"I am very pleased with this lens. Last week I took approx. 700 pictures on a trip to Iran, mainly using this lense. The IS, together with the f/2.8 makes it a very good indoor lens. I some of the museums you are not allowed to use flash; this lens is solving that problem.I believa that the softness I expire in the photos is because of my D40 camerahouse, not the lens.What I am missing:- the weather-proofing you get on the L-series- the Lens Hood should be a part of the (expensive) lens- A pouch should be a part of the (expensive) lens",4

"Heinrich Boell's ""Ansichten eines Clowns"" is a fresco of postwar Germany, a very different landscape than today's. Boell's generation were tortured by remorse - and justly so; remorse humanized them. This is a novel about pain, loss and ethics: individual ethics and collective ethics; about how Hans remains faithful to his beliefs to the bitter end, about how Marie takes the path that she has to take. Together with Guenter Grass's ""The Tin Drum"" (published four years earlier), the ""Clown"" is the greatest novel of the Erhard period.",4
As a layperson I cannot comment on the accuracy of the translation but it reads elegantly and the ethos and sometimes pathos of the writers are blatantly palpable. They can be read aloud easily as they most certainly were intended for such a purpose. Two of the writers (Clement of Alexandria and Ignatius of Antioch) quite likely had direct contact with the original Apostles. The Didache may predate the gospels. In any case this collection gives a good glimpse of Christianity at its very early form. Essential reading indeed.,4
"Very good introduction to the writings of the apostolic fathers. However, I feel it was a major oversight for the author and/or publisher not to include the Epistle of Barnabus and Shepherd of Hermas in the book since these two documents are crucial to the study of early church literature. Apart from this obvious mistake, a very good book.",4
"Swindoll is always a gifted writer giving special insight to the reader. ""Esther"" brings to life the struggles and emotions one faces in life's difficult situations. Esther reflects poise, strength and courage in the midst of trials. This is an encouraging and one the most thoughtful accounts of Esther that I have read.",4
"Having ordered this book as ""new condition"" I was disappointed when it was delivered and all the corners were slightly bent. I don't mind that it was only slightly damaged. I do mind however that it was advertised as ""new.""",4
I love this case! I had recently cracked the entire back of my phone due to having a non- protective case on it. I ordered this otter box because it’s cute but also provides protection. It fits my phone perfectly and is very comfortable to hold. It has protected the camera in the back and is very durable - I don’t even have a scratch on it yet!,5
"I’ve been through a few phone cases for my iPhone 14 Pro Max and haven’t found one that fits it well (particularly around the rear facing camera)…until now! I don’t understand how so many different cases don’t fit something as popular as an iPhone (especially in the exact same place and way). The magnet is the right amount of strength too, not at all weak so holds on to my car mount, but easy to remove if you are intentionally trying to remove it from a mount or charger.",5
"I love this phone case. It’s not bulk or slippery and I love the shimmer. I also use a metal magnetic mag safe pop socket and it sticks amazingly. I’ve dropped my phone several times with this case on and it protects it. Otter box is great! I just bought a new one to replace my old one, which was about a year and a half old. They last a long time but it will yellow over time. I recommend replacing once a year to keep it looking clear and pretty.",5

"The ASUS ROG Strix G16 is an absolute powerhouse and a dream machine for gamers and creators alike.Equipped with top-tier hardware, this laptop handles everything I throw at it effortlessly. Gaming is buttery smooth even with maxed-out settings, and multitasking is seamless thanks to the powerful processor and ample RAM.The 16-inch screen with its high refresh rate is stunning. The colors are vibrant, the details are sharp, and the fluidity makes fast-paced games feel immersive and responsive.Sleek, modern, and undeniably ROG. The RGB keyboard is customizable and adds a premium feel, while the cooling system is highly effective and keeps the laptop running optimally even during long sessions.For a gaming laptop, the Strix G16 strikes a great balance between performance and portability. It’s lightweight enough to carry around without sacrificing the power you’d expect from a desktop replacement.While gaming laptops are known for short battery lives, the G16 pleasantly surprised me with its efficiency during non-gaming tasks.For the specs and performance this machine offers, it’s worth every penny. It’s an investment that will serve well for years to come.Whether you’re gaming, streaming, or editing, the ASUS ROG Strix G16 is a beast. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a reliable, high-performance laptop!",5
"The new ASUS ROG STRIX G16 gaming laptop I tried out has exceeded my expectations in terms of quality and graphics capabilities. The sleek but robust metal construction of the laptop provide durability and luxury, making it a standout choice for gaming enthusiasts. The graphics performance of this laptop is exceptional from the graphics card and delivering stunning visuals and smooth gameplay that enhance the overall gaming experience, much better from a laptop than i expected. The high-resolution display and advanced graphics technology bring games to life with vibrant colors and sharp detail. Overall, the ASUS G16 has exceeded my expectations, keeping cool under heavy loads, running games well, and a bulletproof build.5/5 from a gamer.",5
"I wanted to buy another laptop for work purposes but also be useful for travelling and for gaming so I saw this laptop for sale during Black Friday! Excellent purchase! Here is my pros and cons after a week of owning this:Con:1. 1920 x 1200 FHD 165Hz Display is very much an downgrade against my Legion 5 Pro 16"" 2560 x 1600 IPS LCD 165Hz Display... But I guess with the parts offered, ASUS had to make some budget cuts somewhere I guess... (for the model I've chosen and not wanting to spend more than $1500 USD).2. Automatic MUX Switching is annoying... it optimizes which option to best suit for your current usage at the time (e.g. if you ran an game vs closing the game and brings you to the desktop). The automatic switch seems like its great and all but it ruins the display setting and when an game is playing, it switches again and sends you back to the desktop and ruins the display setting/resolution once more... Its best to just set it on the dedicated GPU option so you dont have to deal with this...3. Standard SSD Capacity is too low (again with cost saving measures but literally everyone these days just buy additional SSD stick anyways)... so snagged an SK.Hynix P41 SSD 2TB stick on sale to manually install for loading heavy application and games on there; really easy to install and easy to unscrew the back; there is an empty NVMe Gen4 M.2 2280 slot for you to install your SSDWorks Great after installing correctly and no Issues now! (make sure after install of SSD, just load into Windows and open up disk management to reformat (quick format! never full on SSD!) No need to tinker with BIOS setting...Do not tighten the SSD screws too much where the stick bends! thats incorrect! screw in ever so slightly so that the stick itself wont lodge out or move at all.Pros:1. RTX 4060 8GB - 140W Max TGP2. i7-13650HX - beats my Ryzen-7 5800H on my Legion 5 Pro3. RGB bar looks awesome!4. Battery 90WhNeutral:1. RGB Keys - heard mixed reviews on ASUS's design on this; of course, the Legion 5 RGB keyboard design is the best of the best but this is just okay and its not too bad in my eyes.2. Same weight and nearly the same dimensions as my Legion 5 Pro so portability is the same-ish but way better than my old MSI gaming laptop from 2017 where you can put this in your backpack and still have room to put other accessories and such.This is all I've noticed currently but either way, its a great mid-tier gaming laptop! I can run cyberpunk all max setting without issues or framerate drops and every other AAA game titles up to this point... This laptop should last an long time until AAA games becomes more graphically intense and requiring more processing power... but again this is the best you can get for your money and highly recommend!",5
I like that's nearly the quietest laptop compared to its competitors with same specs. also I'm impressedwith the GPU performance.maybe there's some coilwhine yeah but very minor to notice.overall I really like it!!,5
"The laptop performs well, with about 4 months of usage and it is still rock solid.",5
"I invested in the Amazon Basics Stainless Steel Comfort Grip Knife Set, and my kitchen experience has been nothing short of wonderful. This 18-piece set is a complete arsenal for all your culinary adventures. With each knife designed for a specific task, it's like having a professional kitchen right on your countertop.The first thing that caught my eye was the sleek design and the comfort grip handles. These knives not only look gorgeous on my kitchen counter, but the grip is so ergonomic that chopping has become a less tedious task. The brushed stainless steel handles offer a secure and comfortable grip, making the knives easy to control even during demanding tasks.The high carbon stainless steel blades are the stars of the show. They are stain, rust, and pit resistant, which is a testament to their durability. With a satin finish, they glide through ingredients with ease. The variety of knives in this set is impressive, catering to all kinds of food prep tasks like chopping, cutting, slicing, peeling, and much more.Now, while the knives are sharp and ready to use out of the box, I did notice that they might need frequent sharpening with heavy use. The good news is that the set includes a sharpening steel, so keeping the blades sharp and ready is not a chore.The rubber wood block that houses the knives is compact and stylish, fitting well in any kitchen setting. The set includes a chef's knife, bread knife, ham knife, santoku knife, utility knife, vegetable knife, paring knife, sharpening steel, and eight steak knives, all neatly organized in a rubber wood block.The affordability of this set is a cherry on top. It's a budget-friendly option without compromising on quality or functionality. The Amazon Basics Stainless Steel Comfort Grip Knife Set is indeed a valuable addition to any kitchen. The quality, the range of knives, and the price point make it a commendable choice. I highly recommend this set to anyone looking to upgrade their kitchen game without breaking the bank.",5
"I needed some knives for a horror movie I'm filming. I don't want people to die but I love making movies about it. I needed a block of knives that weren't good chef's knives but that we could use to film.They look GREAT on camera!!! Not the best for cooking if you're a chef but you already know that. They came sharp and even made the ""shink!"" sound when pulled out.If you actually care about good knives, get good knives. These are fine as a movie prop.",5
"I love the price of these. They're very basic, run-of-the-mill knives, but the product is well made. I needed a new set of knives on a budget (my old dull ones weren't very practical) and these showed up on my page. Very nice product for the price, allowed me to get a new set of knives on a budget",5
Great value for the money! You get alot of knives in this set and also many different types depending on the use you need. They are VERY sharp and cut beautifully,5
I am really happy with this knife set. The block is beautiful on its own and the knives are terrific. I would highly recommend this high-quality knife set.,5
Very sharp and pretty set,5
i got these to replace an old set that was missing(thanks honey) pieces. it's true apparently they don't make good gardening tools. I've been using them for a while now and can vouch for their build quality. they work very well and i use them every day. it's a lovely set and perfect for someone on a budget or a gift for the child who finally moved out... just saying.,5
"I love these knives! The block is nice, the craftsmanship really shines, and was sooooo happy with how affordable they were. Just be careful cause they’re hella sharp!",5
"No negatives. This faucet was super easy to install, and it looks great! I needed a way to dispense water from the under counter filtered water system without drilling a hole in the granite. This faucet is the perfect solution. It easily connected to the filter system (Aquasana) without any additional hardware. To dispense the filtered water through the cross bar simply pull the lever straight down. The quality of the faucet is high end, heavy duty and sturdy. I love the way the black and brushed nickel finish goes with my countertop. I also love how firmly the nozzle retracts and stays up without sagging down.",5
I wanted a nice looking faucet that I could use for reverse osmosis & regular water. This fit the bill. Gorgeous & functional! Don’t hesitate to buy it.,5
"Looks great 10/10 and a very easy installationLove that it doesn’t smear or get dirty fastFeels very durable and solid , water flow is amazing high flow and doesn’t leak at all",5
I have made the mistake of going the cheap route with kitchen hardware because brands like Moen and Kohler are always beyond expensive. Kraus feels like a well established brand that continues to try and sell quality products at a great price point. I also got a sink from them (amazon open box) and both looks amazing compared to what we had before. The filtered drinking water option is also a godsend.,5
"Great faucet, absolutely love it. Wanted to save on counter space so needed a faucet that combined RO into the same faucet. Have it for a while already and works great. No complaints at all.",5
Easy to install and very nice quality. Looks great in our kitchen.,5
"Have been using this for over a month now, and it's been great! Good build quality, looks great, and having the filtered water built-in as opposed to needing to drill a separate hole in the counter is really convenient (and works well)! I would highly recommend this faucet.EDIT: Following up again 7 months later, and this faucet is still great! It remains sturdy and still looks great.",5
"Very few kitchen faucets that include a dedicated separate filtered water tap. This saved me the toil of drilling a hole on my ceramic sink for a separate filtered water tap.Works well and is well built, albeit somewhat pricey. Mine was discounted as it was used, otherwise I would have been hesitant. In retrospect I would not have greatly regretted paying full price.Installation instructions were easy to follow.",5
"Perfect product if you have a RO system under the sink and you don't one an extra faucet. Looks really good, and minimal it's easy to install and to use.The colour is a true champagne gold and not as ""yellow"" as it looks in the pictures.",5
"This faucet is awesome for those who wants to add RO water to without drilling a hole. The nut design is super easy to install, it has two Philip screws that does the final tightening; brilliant.For me, I took the old RO water hole and turn it into a glass rinser.",5
"I'll cut to the chase for anyone who simply wants to know if Vitamix blenders are worth the investment. My answer is yes. Unequivocally.This is my second Vitamix. My first one (the 6300) is about 7 years old & STILL going strong, but I was happy to have the opportunity to try this new Ascent X4 because of the presets for many of the things I commonly blend. The 5 presets (smoothies, frozen desserts, soups, frozen cocktails, and last but not least, dips & spreads) take the guesswork out of which settings to use for many of the types of foods & beverages that I make on a regular basis.So far, I've used the presets on my Ascent X4 to blend smoothies & frappes and to clean my container when I've finished using it. (Btw, not that it was difficult to do this manually with my 6300, but I love the self-cleaning feature!) In addition, even though there's no preset for it on this model I was still able to make a great, super-smooth batch of almond butter with help from the ""dips and spreads"" setting, too!More things I love about the Ascent X series:- 10-year warranty -- almost unheard of these days- smart technology that tells me when I should use the tamper (if I'm not already using it)- clever tamper storage that conveniently fits on either side (I'll never need to hunt for it again!)- ability to blend manually without using a preset and includes a ""pulse"" feature- additional 15 seconds can be added with one touch on the ""15+""- motorized base accepts all self-detect containers, including a food processor (I can hardly wait to get that one!)- container is dishwasher safe (it self-cleans exceptionally well but some might like this option)- easy to see when it's *powered on -- lights appear on the display, or off -- no lights (*Btw, the power button is hidden on the lower right side of the base beneath the edge. I say this because I had trouble finding it myself, lol.)I'll end with the fact that Vitamix stands 100% behind their products and the company has STELLAR customer service. If there's any issue with your blender or its components it's easy to contact them by phone. Not only do you get to talk with a real person, but those who answer calls are friendly, knowledgeable & helpful. I speak from experience.",5
"I bought a Vitamix in 1999, and it's still going strong to this day. I have used and abused it over the years and it just keeps on going. I wanted to get a more modern version that has electronic optionsfor pre-programmed features like smoothies, etc. I have to admit that I was a little concerned that Vitamix would follow the trend of many popular, formerly high-quality brands by making products *look* better while lessening overall quality. I'm relieved to report that as far as I can tell, this machine is still a high quality machine that I would expect from Vitamix. The base and motor sounds feel and sound familiar... like an old friend. I love that even though there are pre-programmed functions, you still have the option to run the machine like an old Vitamix. That is, on/off and a dial to hone in on the perfect speed for what you're making. You can turn it on and go without having to navigate menus to find a ""manual"" mode. For professional chefs and experienced home cooks, this is important.The pre-programmed options are great. Combined with the extensive recipe book, you can make flawless recipes! If you're a beginner home cook, this machine could change your life.One thing I made all the time in my previous Vitamix is hummus, so that's the first thing I tried in the new one. And when I say I make hummus, I start by making tahini from sesame seeds and oil. The Vitamix handled this step flawlessly. In seconds, I had a beautiful tahini base for my hummus. Next I added chickpeas, lemon, salt and a bit of water. This Vitamix made a beautiful, super creamy and smooth hummus. I know some people like hummus that's a little rough, but I prefer a super smooth one and that's completely doable in this Vitamix.I was kind of hoping that in their years of R&D that they would have found a way to make it easier to get thick food like hummus out of the canister more easily, but that's a big ask. So I did have to use a spatula to get all the goodness out of the bottom.I have made some smoothies, mayo and potato soup -- all things my previous Vitamix did effortless, and this new model handles all these tasks without complaining. It truly is a beautiful machine and I'm really excited to keep using it and trying new things.My only concern for the future is the electronics side of things. I hope they engineered that as well as the motor and other physical aspects. With the old Vitamix, there are 2 switches and a dial. There's not much to go wrong as long the motor is working. And Vitamix makes powerful and quality motors, which is why my 25 year-old Vitamix shows no signs of slowing down today. Since I can't really test the electronics side of things, I'm really hoping they did put the R&D and build quality into that side of things as well.Overall, I'm super happy with this latest professional grade model and am so happy that Vitamix is still making high-quality and user-friendly products!",5
"I can now make dinner in a flash - and saves my sanity when chopping broccoli.No more mess in the kitchen, it works great and is of really good quality.Blades are sharp and I love the tool to protect your fingers which does not come with the other models I have seen.Does require some strength though - my kids struggle with harder veggies so I had to help.Popped everything in the dishwasher after use and made cleaning up so easy. We love it so far.",5
This chopper is awesome. I have a single chopper but this was is so fast and easy to use and clean.,5
"I have almost nothing to complain about with this kit. It cuts effortlessly compared to the cheaper one I used to have. Doesnt really matter what, onions, peppers, apples, carrots, potatoes, all of them go through it like a hot knife through butter. The ergonomics are great, I will say that I have yet to use the mandoline portion on top. Just haven't had a use case yet. But if the blades in that are as good as they are in the chopper, I don't doubt that it will have just as good as an experience. The storage for the blades is convenient and well thought out. I especially love the little comb that you can use to clean out the plate that pushes things through the blades. It makes cleaning up much easier than any previous chopper that I've used. My only real complaint about this is that the container that the chopped food enters is a bit too short. This both limits how much you can chop before having to empty the container, and it also prevents you from being able to fully close the chopper up with all the blades in their storage recepticles. Its a bit of a nitpick honestly. But it would be nice to have everything securely in one spot without having to worry about anything falling out if it gets tipped over.Other than that, great buy, highly recommend. Also I love the color!",5
"It’s sharp, easy to assemble, and saves time chopping vegetables. Highly recommend!",5
"I got this dicer for 50% off, I think, paying only $30 or so for a normally $60 dicer. This is the first dicer that I have ever owned, although I have used a friend's dicer, and I will say that this cuts through about anything that you would need to dice in the kitchen. Like most dicers, stuff gets caught and stuck in the blades and the platform thingy, and it's a little hard to wash, especially because those blades are seriously sharp. An onion stands no chance against those blades. All of the different tools/slicers are really awesome and work really well for the most part.It isn't quite as big as what I thought it would be when I purchased it, and to give you an idea, most of the time I need to quarter an onion in order for it to be diced correctly and not smush out of the sides. If it's a small onion, you can fit half of it in the dicing area and get it done that way. I am extremely happy with the purchase overall, especially at that price, and it has taken away a lot of frustration and time when I cook. Next time, I will probably get one that's a little bigger, but this is most definitely a game changer by itself. Highly recommend this dicer. Just be careful with those blades! They are super sharp and got two of us bleeding within the first three or four days. Lol",5
"This chopper is just awesome . Nicely built , no cheap plastic . And all blades are sharp .",5
Solid and great quality. The blades are thick and the plastic parts do not feel flimsy. Very useful.,5
Highly recommended,5
"The media could not be loaded. I recently upgraded my kitchen with the CAROTE 11-piece Non-Stick Pots and Pans Set, and it's been a game-changer for my cooking routine. The cream white color gives my kitchen a clean, modern look, and the non-stick surface truly lives up to its claims. Food slides right off, making both cooking and cleanup a breeze. I love that I can use less oil, and even delicate foods like eggs don’t stick, which makes every meal feel healthier and fresher.One of my favorite features is the removable handle, which is incredibly practical. It snaps on and off easily, so I can transfer pots from stovetop to oven or fridge without taking up extra space or needing separate storage for bulky handles. This space-saving design has been perfect for my small kitchen and would be amazing for anyone with limited storage or even an RV setup. Plus, the set is induction-compatible, which opens up a lot of versatility, especially if you have mixed appliances.Overall, this CAROTE cookware set has been an ideal addition to my kitchen. It's lightweight but durable, easy to clean, and does everything I need it to do, from stovetop to oven to fridge. It’s been a worthwhile investment, and I can tell it’s going to last me a long time. If you’re looking for a practical, stylish, and space-efficient cookware set, I highly recommend giving CAROTE a try!",5
"Absolutely amazing!!! Best purchase I’ve done in a while. The coating makes it super easy to cook and food really doesn’t stick, even with small amounts of oil or similar. The removable handles are great and easy to apply and remove. The color is lovely, the little dots give it a little extra something that looks very nice. The fact that you can take them from stove to oven to the table and they still look cute it’s definitely a great extra. Heat distribution is amazing! Everything cooks very evenly! The stacking makes is easier to store and they are also super easy to clean.",5
"I bought these to save my time in the kitchen, and the results are better than expected. I like the detachable handles, since they allow me to squeeze more pots on my stovetop, while eliminated bumping a handle and spilling the contents. They nest well in a drawer, using less than half the space required by my old pots. The non stick coating has held up very well, and I am saving more time than I planned when cleaning them",5
"“I am absolutely thrilled with this CAROTE Pots and Pans Set! The non-stick coating works flawlessly, making cooking and cleanup a breeze. I love the space-saving design – the detachable handle is such a clever feature, especially for storing everything neatly in my small kitchen and even fitting them in the fridge! The cream white color adds a touch of elegance, and the set is versatile enough for all my cooking needs. It heats evenly on my induction stovetop, and being oven-safe is a huge plus. This set has truly upgraded my cooking experience – I can’t recommend it enough!”",5
I've been looking at these for a while and finally gave in and got them. I have an issue with my pots and pans not being able to fit into the cupboard properly number one because they don't all settle into each other perfectly and the handles stick out. So far they seem to cook through very evenly they're heavy weight and easy to clean. They're very pretty looking and it's super convenient to have the handle store next to it. Also the lids are nice that they function is a cover and the whole pan and lid can be put into your refrigerator together or take into another person's house. It eliminates the need for Tupperware. For the price I have found these in extremely good buy and would recommend them to other people,5
"As an avid cook, I’ve been searching for the perfect pots and pans for a long time, and after trying many, I can't believe I didn't discover these sooner! These pots and pans are lightweight yet durable, with a non-stick surface that makes cooking and cleaning a breeze. I ended up discarding half a dozen of my old ones after using these. What I love most is how they store in my cabinet – the detachable handles allow me to stack them neatly, saving so much space. Plus, the inclusion of high-quality felt sheets for protection shows they really care about the product’s longevity. The price is great, and I will definitely buy these again as gifts!",5
"The media could not be loaded. I recently purchased the T-fal Ultimate Hard Anodized Nonstick Fry Pan Set, and it has quickly become a staple in my kitchen. The nonstick coating is impressive – even with minimal oil, food slides right off without sticking. This makes cooking so much easier and clean-up even faster, as I can simply wipe the pans with a sponge and they’re good as new. Another thing I love is how evenly these pans heat up; whether I’m cooking vegetables or frying eggs, there are no hot spots, so everything cooks perfectly. The set feels durable and well-made, with comfortable handles that stay cool while cooking. Overall, this set is an excellent value for anyone looking for quality, user-friendly frying pans.",5
"I'm doing an initial review of this cookware set. As it's being used, my intention is to come back to this review with updates.I ordered this set after doing a bit of 'googling' on what is the best cookware set for 2019 - I wanted something for our gas range. I think it's something to take into consideration when choosing what you're going to buy. An example - on a gas range - if the setting is high and your cookware has some sort of enamel-like finish, and the flames are coming over the sides of the pot/pan - it's going to discolor the finish after a period of time.I looked at the top 10 bracket, the top 5 bracket, I went to reviews, Good Housekeeping, Consumer Reports, just to name two of several, and surprisingly (at least for me) T-Fal was a set that kept popping up as one of the best. I've always thought of T-Fal as one of those starter cookware sets that someone might purchase when they're moving into their first apartment and starting out on their own - it is/was inexpensive - a set for a person learning to cook and therefore not requiring something more 'higher-end.' If you have/had those thoughts as well, you might want to set them aside, at least with this set..Upon pulling everything out of the box my first impression was they look really nice. The set is light weight - the handles are riveted, silicone encased and can withstand up to 400 degree oven temperature. The lids are heavy tempered glass, each one having a small vent hole, and the handles are also silicone encased as well. The design of the lid-handles seems to take into account the use of pot holders since there's substantial space between the glass and the handle itself. All of the lids in my set fit nicely onto their respective pot/pan - no warpage or bent rims. The pots/pans are dishwasher safe (mine aren't going to see the inside of a dishwasher), and this particular set you can use metal utensils (I personally ain't-a-gonna do it). It comes with a steamer that is designed to stack on top of the large pot (not the dutch oven). When you're done steaming, grab some pot holders and lift the insert out by it's handles - no muss, no fuss. It's a much better option than the collapsible steamer I currently using.It comes with instructions on how to care for your cookware. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS! Why you may ask? This set is replacing a Calphalon set, and yes Calphalon was/is rated highly as well. But why replace it? Because being the knuckle head that I am, I didn't read the instructions. I knew Calphalon had to be hand washed (at least the set that I own) - but what I didn't know was what high heat does to the pots. When you read the instructions for T-Fal, and because it's aluminum, it'll say something to the effect of using low to medium heat (because aluminum conducts heat really well). See … I didn't know that about anodized aluminum and what I ended up doing was burning the finish off of each pot and skillet bottom of my Calphalon set - right down to the bare aluminum and of course this affected the non-stick surface on the inside. So please, read and follow the instructions. One other thing before I wrap this up. When I was doing my 'research' I came across this one video of an owner showing how an empty T-Fal pot didn't sit level on her stove. Seems the handle was heavy enough that it caused the pot to tip. She said this was a problem - and I guess it could be if you're in the process of putting something inside the pot in preparation of cooking. I do get that - but I placed an empty pot on the stove, centered over the burner, and it sat just fine - although I'll say my stove grate is different than the stove in the video - it also sat level on the counter top. Perhaps this might be something to take into consideration???So initial impression is the set seems to be of good quality, looks nice, and I'm looking forward to putting this set through it's paces.UPDATE:As of December 4, 2019 I have to say that the T-Fal set has held up extremely well - cooking with this set is a breeze. I keep the burner setting usually at med-high if I want to bring something to a boil - and it doesn't take long for that to happen. The pots and pans conduct heat really well and there's practically no sticking. Usually I can pretty-much rinse off any food residue left behind using just running hot water. I'm pretty good at using either wooden or silicon-type utensils when cooking, though on occasion I've used metal spoons to stir, and there are no marks inside any of the pots/pans. I'm not one of those cooks adept enough to shift a pan around and flip the contents briefly into the air (my cool-factor is not that high) so ""skating"" the bottom of a pot/pan over the cast-iron grate has not taken place, so I can't say what would happen to this set if I were to do so. If I were to hazard a guess, I would say that more than likely there would be some marring of the bottom since cast iron probably trumps aluminum. Overall I'm very please with this purchase and the performance of this cook set.",5
"I try to wait on reviews so that I can provide an accurate and fair review. This was a great purchase. These pans look amazing and are very sturdy. Stick fee is 5 stars. Durability 5 stars. Look new after 6 months. Easy to keep clean. After 6 months no scratches or marks. I will admit that I an very careful about cleaning and us only cloth or sponge as I have ruined other, more expensive brands in the past.",5
"Wishmaster, Nemo and Oceanborn all rate higher than a five so this just gets a five (let's farget about the horror tha was Century Child). It's a really powerful album although not as classic as the other albums, Tarja stull has a powerful voice especially in Elvenpath and Astral Romance. Get this album. Though if your a newbie then I recommend Wishmaster and Oceanborn first.",5
"first off i not a kid ect. This album is excellent, but the only thing I didnt like was the male vocals, but Tarja's voice is beautiful. Anway except for the male vocals, this was an amazing CD.",5
The Discs were in original unopened packaging and work perfectly. We love the series and enjoyed the extras at the end.,5
"to the reviewer whodat, the price for all the sets are the same. Amazon chose to only give a discount of 15% on this set as compared to 25% off on the first two.",5
"I first seen this movie when i was about 10 years old. It really freaked me out with its wierdness but years after, when i got to about 19 years old, i still couldnt get it out of my head. Then i started wondering if its out on DVD, to my surprise, it was! WOW! I thought i was the only one who really dig this film, slapstick humour, perfectly cast characters, some sexy, not to mention, psycho chicks & troma style gore! Even the main characters get in touch with thier darkside's! Its a classic & includes a lot of characters from the toxic avenger movies. Its a classic troma film, & a stand-alone awesome independant film aswell. If u aint seen a Troma film b4, definetly check it out. It bends hollywood rules & goes beyond them! Lloyd Kaufman's a genius! Its a low budget film but some of the special FX will amaze you....By the way, i havent even got the 1 with special features like deleted scenes & commentary, so even more reason to buy this, i am.",5
Class of Nuke Em'High is so awesomely bad!!! It is the best 'bad' movie I have ever seen! I have watched this movie over and over for more than 10 years... I know every word and every scene... I can also point out all the mess-up's!! I never get tired of seeing this film!!,5
"If you have seen the movies or know the story, the book is a completely different experiance! Beautiflly written and so much more than just a story about a man who doesn't age while the portrait does. Captivating and darkly thought provoking.. Great writting and facinating characters. Highly recommended!",5
I have watched the old movie of this story and the newer one but had never read the book. This was excellent!,5
"Classical, timeless and wonderfully written tale of that expands on the 'how evil corrupts your soul' theory.",5
"I listened to the audio version, which was a delight. This classic impresses upon the reader the importance of Christ's rhetorical question: what does it profit a man to gain the whole word but lose his soul? Wilde also underscores the point that true beauty resides in the eternal soul not the temporal body. This is a book to read and re-read.",5
"I was highly impressed by this novel of arts, society, morality and immortality. It has to be one of the most deepest things that I have ever read. One thing that bothered me a little was how Oscar Wilde went through this long winded prose and at times became a bit essay like but it had gave me food for thought.",5
"I haven't actually read the book yet, but dang does it look good on my shelf! Penguin clothbound is wonderful.",5
"Great book, very quick read and a must for anyone who really wants to understand the english cannon. I think I've seen 3 ""Twilight Zone"" episodes that feature the same plot though, kind of ruined the surprise halfway through...",5
I love this book! I completely think that I have fallen in love with the character Lord Henry. He is by far one of the wittiest characters that I have ever read in a book and trust me that I have read many books! I think that Oscar Wilde was a genius and this is one of the best literary works that he has written.It is a story of innocence lost and the quest of forever staying young.,5
"This is a beautiful book, full of vivid word pictures. Wilde is a genius of literature. Everyone should read this book",5
"The Picture of Dorian Gray is an amazing story told with such wonderful truth and cynicysim as only Wilde could tell it. Not only do I have much of the book highlighted, but it is worn from reading again and again. I would definitly reccomend this brilliant novel to anyone who wants to walk away with a feeling as if they've discovered a treasure they must share with the world.",5
This is a beautiful and witty tale about a depraved man. His ugly soul is mirrored by his ever-changing portrait while he retains his youthful visage. Suspenseful throughout. A classic.,5
This book is a facsinating read that blends insult and injury quite well. Fat and ugly people surely will be delighted or destroyed. Wittisms roar and pundits will roll in hedonism for the intelligentsia. A must-read for good-looking people and geniuses everywhere.,5
"After reading this story of a man who is so caught up in beauty that he ruins his life over it, I took the time to examine my own feelings on many things....Wilde has done it again in this one.I LOVED IT!!",5
"Still controversial today, Wilde's study of a man's moral distintigration is both richly poetic and ultimately disturbing. The book even resists classification today. Is it part of the Decadence movement or the Symbolist movement?Or is it an experimental novel, fashioned perhaps as a psychological gothic study? More importantly, though, Wilde's creation poses the question: Can a book be poisonous? Gray succumbs to the ""evil"" influence of Huysmans' book A Rebours. As Wilde as written, ""there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. Books are well written or badly written."" Wilde may have created a well written book, but he also, albeit purposely, created a book when, viewed from its many horizons, can be seen as terrible moral study in the lesson Gray undergoes.",5
I've only just started reading the book but so far I've enjoying what I've read of it to this point.,5
"I quite enjoyed the sharp witty dialogue,particularily that of Lord Henry who was one of the most interesting and provocative characters I've come across in quite some time.",5
"First of all, it is free and it is a classic you cannot miss. Short lecture with a great story",5
"This is a kick-ass rock group! I heard them on the AllGirlRadio station on the internet, and loved them!!! It's good to hear some good old rock, especially from women! Being a huge Joan Jett fan, I really appreciate this group!",5
"This band is simply awesome. The vocals are hard without being overbearing and the music demands respect. Each track is just as rockin' as the last, there are no dull moments here.",5
"This is a wonderful resource for clinician's, especially those that may NOT be used to working with TBI, right CVA and the higher level dysfunctions. It has exercises, compensatory strategies for both the patient, and suggestions for the patient. I've used it for years.",5
"Until Death Do Us Parta is the first book I've read from this author and it was GREAT. I recommend to everyone who like romance, suspense and mistery. This is not your run-of-the mill romance, suspense story !!This fantastic, suspense packed story is one that I will be keeping in my favorites file. These well described and highly developed characters have such an emotional bond between them that it brought tears to my eyes many times while reading this tale! Readers will not want to put this book down.This story for me was one that I didn't want to put down and when I absolutely had to, it kept calling my name until I could get back to it. GJT Simpson has got himself a new fan with this captivating and enchanting book and I can't wait to read what else he has in store!!! Outstanding! *****",5
We love it! We saw it last year at the camp ground. I got it for my B-day and enjoy the simple use and small size. When there is not fire pit or fires are not allowed that's the winner!,5
"It works great,the only thing Idon't like is the cheesy fake log, it would much better with the fake logs that come with gas fireplaces.",5
I used this book for a graduate class on public finance. The price was right and all the students had access to the electronic copy. The book content was very good for our purposes and allowed me to discuss the topics without the need for an overly expensive text book.,5
"i bought these socks at first because they looked funny and was curious so i thought i would give it a try. It did take some time to get used to having my toes being separated, but after a while, i don't even want to take them off. It did get kind of embarrassing when i take my shoes off in front of people though. but overall, i do like these socks.",5
At first the socks feel a bit constricting but after 5 minutes you can't feel them at all. I just ran 5 miles and had no blisters or sore toes for the first time. I am buying two more pairs now :),5
"I wear these with my vibrams and love them - have never gotten a blister. I've also used them in a bunch of races, as much as 100 miles, and had great luck. However, if you're doing a race that's going to be really wet or have stream crossings, I would recommend getting one of the higher cut ones since the lowest cut one can fall down when it gets really wet, which is annoying and makes heel blisters more likely.",5
"I have only had these for a short time, but after a few hours of wearing them to get used to the extra material, I am really enjoying them. I use these socks not only when running, but for basketball and tennis too. Works great so far, and I am going to buy more of them.",5
"I wear these type socks and footlets for relief from one toe that has started going under the toe next to it. On my feet for hours and it gets painful. These are well made, keep toes straight (like when I was younger) and keep me going painfree. I wish this company made this style, little footlets that don't show with dress shoes.",5
"injinji Micro Toesocks are very well made. The material seems to very comfortable. They stay in place, without slipping down in my shoes",5
"I bought these socks for my Five Fingers, but ended up running a marathon in them. I was having bad blisters on the tops of my second and third toes after long runs (15+ miles) and gave them a shot. For the marathon, I also sprayed some second skin (I forget the brand) but afterwards I had no blisters anywhere. Very happy with these socks. (As an aside, I also own the lightweight version of these. Great for Five Fingers, too loose for regular shoes.)",5
"At first I hated these socks because I never wore toe socks and the only reason I bought them is because I bought me a pair of vibram toe shoes. After awhile I got use to it being between my toes and now I love them and are by far the most comfy socks, while second best. Asics are the best but these are better than any Nike socks.",5
"These socks were for my son, who runs lots of races. He was getting blisters on his toes, but with these socks, no more blisters. He wears them under high quality running shoes, and under minimalist shoes. He's very happy with the socks.",5
These socks are great. I bought them to wear with my Vibram Five Fingers. They are soft and fit nice and snug and don't bunch up and the heel doesn't ride down as I run. Great find!,5
"I bought these socks on a whim because I just purchased a pair of Vibram FiveFinger Bikila LS toe shoes. Love the shoes, but I am not wearing these socks with them because the shoes are skin tight without the socks. I have ended up wearing my injinji's with every other pair of shoes I own. I currently have 3 pairs of these socks and will be purchasing more very soon. I will never wear a regular pair of socks again. I am officially a toe-sock convert. They allow a greater range of motion and completely eliminate toe bunching caused by socks.",5
"Great toe socks, my sisters bf loves them. He wears them all the time with his toe shoes, and they are super soft.",5
"Finally some toe socks for guys withh big feet. These are wonderful and comfortable, will be getting more of these.",5
"very good product, excellent time and attention me dieron respuestas a mis preguntas and get my order in the time ordered",5
Item was Shipped fast and it was exactly what I expected and my son loved the socks thank you very much!,5
"I absolutely love these socks, they are the most comfortable socks I've ever worn in boots or cross trainers. I need about 10 more pair.",5
If you own Vibrams these are a must. Vibram sold toesocks are over priced. Injinji makes microfiber in all sizes compatible with Vibram socks and are more affordable. Especially since my Vibrams with shipping took me over 100 bones.-Sgt of Marines,5
"I have had a pair of vibram five fingers KSO treks for about two months. I love the shoes which recently started causing blisters in certain areas. I broke down and started buying these socks which have not disappointed. They have eliminated the foot odor in these leather shoes as well as provided a comfortable snug fit for me. Granted, all feet are different and I tend to have some long skinny toes. These stretched to fit comfortably. They seem to be made of quality material.I would not run around sock-footed in these since carpet will ultimately wear holes in them. So far I have machine washed them multiple times and they have retained their shape without stretching. These socks are great to use even if you do not have a pair of vibrams. They work well in regular shoes. I have even worn them in insulated boots.",5
"I bought these socks to wear with the Merrell barefoot model shoes and it was very conclusive. The toes feel great separated like this, it's a bit like not having socks at all. I was afraid to be cold but after walking for a while my feet were hot and at ease.",5
This DVD is for those of us who are not young gym bunnies. It's a good way to ease into yoga.,5
