"The case was very nice for a week or two and then stretched so bad that my phones corners were constantly popping out of it. I had to pop the phone back into the case every time i took the phone out of my pocket. Also the more rubbery part of the case (the sides that stretched) yellowed a lot after just a couple of weeks of use. Could not return it to Amazon bc i didnt have the original box so I submitted a warranty claim on the Otterbox website. They asked for photos and said that my case might qualify for a replacement and i need to ship it back to them. They said that they couldn’t provide a shipping label but my shipping fee will be waived on their side. Liars. So i go and spend $30 on shipping it back, send them the receipt and they say they are not going to reimburse it now. Would not even give me a gift card for that amount. So i end up spending $80 on a bad quality product that i dont even have anymore. I ask them if they can at least send me a replacement in a different color so there is no yellowing problem to which they agree (they said they would make an “exception” for me). But then they ignore me for days. FedEx said that they received my package on Dec 9 but on Dec 19 Otterbox said that they dont have anything and they cannot track my package bc the tracking website didn’t work which of course it did. That was the last email I received from a human. On Dec 22 I received an automatically generated email that my package has been received (13 days after it actually arrived) and that was it. They have been ignoring my emails and not responding. $80 and a lot of my free time down the drain. I would not recommend doing business with them to anyone. I trusted their reputation and I should not have. This is the worst customer service experience i have ever had.",1
"This item looks good, the 2-in-1 separate filter line is useful, and installation was straightforward.Unfortunately after 18 months, the faucet started leaking from inside the metal housing. Even when the faucet was turned off, water would leak slowly from inside the housing, down the line, and dripped over a few days. It ended up ruining my cabinet and the drywall on the ceiling of the floor below.The manufacturer, Kraus, claims a ""lifetime limited warranty"", but within the warranty text, the faucet hardware is only covered from defects for 1 year and 5 years, with more limits. After 1 year, they will also charge you for shipping the defective item back to them.I understand that I should have read the warranty terms in more detail before purchasing the item. However, I didn't expect a kitchen faucet to fail within such a short time frame, given how expensive it was. I also take issue with companies that try extract shipping fees from their customers when their products are defective and under warranty.Since I wasn't interested in paying for shipping to have a defective item repaired, and no longer trusted the manufacturer, I asked about return options. The agent condescendingly answered, ""honey, we're the manufacturer, you'll have to call Amazon about that"" and abruptly ended the conversation.I understand that defective items will occur from time to time. However, I do expect that companies stand by their products and provide support for their customers when it happens. Unfortunately Kraus is not one of those companies and I had to go through Amazon to get help with this situation.I'm sure most people who have bought this product have a faucet that's working fine. However, in the off chance that you get a defective unit, just know that Kraus will not be helpful. You're better off buying from another company for the same price range.",1
The handles fell off the replacements,1
It’s not like the pictures. No metal thing to hang it on. Looks homemade.,1
"These candles were lovely until one totally died even after battery replacement. It won't work at all. These are way too expensive to only last 4 months. I turn them on about 3 times/week for an hour, not every day. Disappointing!",1
"Dollar stores have a better quality then this product, and 10 times cheaper.",1
Keyboard is cheap looks like a disco . Slow,1
POST beeps indicating corrupt bios. Returning.,1
"First boot, saw the windows logo, then BSOD. Couldn't get it to recover as it didn't have a recovery image installed. Couldn't boot safe mode, error stating couldn't install windows in safe mode. BSOD after BSOD after BSOD. Additionally, Amazon customer service was lacking in this experience.Returned for refund. Gotta love the new 30 days to refund on higher priced items like this. Maybe I can order one next month.",1
"ive had this pc for a good 3 and a half years already bout it to play games, but after realizing the hardware was 10+ years old i couldnt play nothing on it so i just used it for school work and ext. Out of the 3 and half years ive had it most of the time ive had it it was either not working at asurion getting fixed or on and not even being used cause itll crash every opportunity it gets. I really wished i refunded when i had the chance but i was to ignorant, after these 3 years ive seen plenty of videos on these pc scams and ext and you can get this exact same computer for a quarter of its price. dont get scammed just because it looks good and has LED lights this computer is literally useless. For 500$ you can find a computer wayy more advanced than this one and last way longer. im truly upset on this purchase its the worst of my life (i just got done paying it off)",1
"Several times it shut down with hardware erro4s and is not compatible with Windows 11. And I constantly have to unplug the keyboard and the mouse and plug them back in to get them to work. I have to do the same with my camera. The box looks great but what a crappy computer it is slower than DialUp they give you a little USB to plug into the computer to have Wi-Fi. It’s the same size as the USB square that comes out of your wireless mouse. What an awful experience from the very first week I bought this computer to the last right now. It is completely shut down I’m in the middle of a business everything I have is on this computer on the cloud to return which I don’t have access now , it’s just horrible . Look at the second picture behind my computer, you’ll notice that the only things that are plugged in are the monitors, keyboard and mouse. And if you look at the first picture, you’ll notice the errors card via storage device, such as an external USB drive, which we don’t have faulty hardware such as a hard drive or CD ROM, which apparently we do now just awful.",1
This computer was marketed as a new gaming computer and never worked at a level for gaming. After a year of trying to make it work we brought it to a professional and they said the components were 5-6 years old and we were better of buying a different computer vs trying to update/fix this one. Thanks for making a kids dream Christmas gift a complete lemon.,1
"This computer is garbage! Parts are from 2011. You'll spend more than what u bought it for to upgrade it to work for ur games! Do urself a favour, save ur money & DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER!",1
"I want a full refund of my money you can’t even use the internet without it lagging, can’t even load fortnite let alone play it got into one match with 4 fps with everything to the lowest I will not stop emailing until you have refunded me",1
"This PC was great to look at, and that's about it. The Wifi was terrible/damaged idk. We even used a third party wifi adapter and it was still awful. We have a 330mbs internet and all my other devices ran fast, so that wasn't the problem. Afterwards, it didn't detect my monitor. I ran it for a couple of minutes and nothing. It sounds like a jet engine while it's running as well. Over all, this PC is not worth the headache I went through. Save your money and look for another option.",1
"The monitor support bar didn't fit .. then once we rigged something together and set it up it kept restarting, wouldn't get past initial set up. DO BETTER !!!",1
The media could not be loaded. The pc and the monitor would not connect at all. The monitor would flash on and say no signal then turn off. The desktop itself from the moment of turning it on made that very loud motor boat sound. The advertised keyboard and mouse were not included a standard set was.I called support who advised they would try and connect me with a IT Person and that took over 30 mins. IT kept telling me to unplug it and plug it back in. Return support was not helpful either please don’t waste time or money on this!,1
Fine for the first few times that it was being used but now is laggy or completely shuts down. Only purchased in August of 2023 and it's now January 2024 so only had it for less than 5 months and it isn't even used heavily. Disappointing.,1
"product is very very bad packaged , LED not working with a very very very small electricity output cable . i literally had to get a power source 5CM beside it to make it fit and still LED not working",1
"This console was a brick the day it was released. As usual, Microsoft is years behind its competitors. I don’t even know why I was stupid enough to purchase one. The biggest issue is that in order to play games you purchased, you must constantly update them. That’s ridiculous. Why? It was working just fine. The other issue is that it continues to take up more and more space. I regret few things in life, but purchasing this junk has to be on the top. Save yourself some headache and buy a different system.",1
"I bought this ”refurbished” console in July, and it stopped turning on in November. This was sold as an “Amazon Refurbished” console. The customer support at Amazon told me they wouldn’t replace it, and they wouldn’t take a return on it. The “warranty is for 90 days,” and the console turned into a brick at 120 days, so there’s nothing that Amazon will do to stand behind their product. They told me to contact Microsoft for help. The warranty that Microsoft gives is from the original purchase date of the console. In my case the “Microsoft warranty” ended on Nov. 21st, and the console quit working on Nov. 25th. So lucky me the only thing I can do is pay Microsoft an additional $300 to get this console replaced. So because I’m one month outside of 90 days and 4 days past a warranty that started before I even owned the console I now own a $450 paper weight. And if I want the company to fix or replace it I get to own what will be a $750 console. All because I trusted Amazon to sell a working “refurbished” console.",1
I thought I’d give this a go seeing as it was Microsoft refurbished. Looked brand new when opened. Everything was great. Then while installing games and watching a movie it locked up. I rebooted and it would lock up then shut off. I reset it several times. Same issue. Safe to say the SSD failed. Spend the few extra dollars and buy new. Waste of time and money.,1
"Picked the referbished unit for the savings. Worth the price. Came with the full warranty. Controller looks new. Was the price of a used one on the local buy and sells, and has warranty. A no lose situation.Update, controller drift after 40 days. Amazon will not accept return and Microsoft will not warranty. DO NOT PURCHASE****",1
"I bought this as a gift and unfortunately was left extremely disappointed. The controller didn’t work, the console freezes during game play with almost every single game we tried and then one week later it will not turn on. Well, it turns on, but nothing will display on the TV other than the Xbox logo. Extremely disappointing and embarrassing given it was a gift. Seems that buying a new one may be worth the money if this is the best alternative. Returning asap and will be using the money toward a new console from a legitimate seller.",1
Product failed on second day. Returned!,1
"Package arrived early, which was nice, console turned on and worked fine, until it came to reading the discs. The console did not work any further than the home screen, super disappointing. And upon trying to clean the disc scanner, the console was customized so there is no access to this point of the hardware; a part allowing you to go further is missing and replaced with a custom piece that won’t move, meaning if it is broken, its broken. There’s no hope in repairing it yourself. Was looking forward to it but was let down",1
I understand this item was not going to be brand new. That said the quality is very poor. Rusted insides not refurbished at all. Does not power on. Oveall disappointed that they would even take someones money and be ok with sending this out.,1
"This phone was not usable on Straight Talk Wireless. Straight Talk informed me that the phone was locked and could not be used on their service until it was unlocked. This phone is listed as unlocked and usable on any service. I contacted Samsung because these are new phones, they had me do a factory reset on the phone and said that would fix the issue. This did nothing to fix the problem.",1
"UPDATE: After having this phone for months I have to say it's the biggest POS that I've ever had!! More glitches than I could list. I took 4 stars away because I'm so angry at all the glitches. Now I'm going to go back to my A10E, at least that was reliable!!I decided to wait to write a review because I was on the fence about keeping it or not. My previous phone was a Samsung A10E which is not a very heavy phone. The A15 is considerably heavier which I am (still) not very comfortable with. Comparing the 2 phones as far as memory is concerned is markedly different. The A10E has 32 gigs of internal memory. The A15 has 128 gigs of internal memory. Considering that I have alot of pics on my phone with several different albums, this makes the A15 a better product. The battery life is quite good. The appearance is beautiful. I purchased the light blue phone. I have a clear cover on my phone. This is my 4th Samsung cell phone. Samsung never disappoints with quality, durability and performance. I love the Samsung Smart Switch which makes moving your data from one phone to another fast and super easy. They don't provide a SIM card or micro SD card so you need to make sure to move your cards into your new phone. The software is similar to previous Samsung phone with a few tweaks. For example, to get a screen shot for the A15 you need to press both power and volume down button simultaneously. What makes the A15 different from any of my previous Samsungs is with the A15 you have to press each twice. There is a feature that would put a floating icon on your screen and open it and tap screenshot then you will get your screenshot. Now, what sold me on the A15 is a neat feature where, upon your approval, they will block all spam/scam phone calls. So no more annoying spam/scam calls!! It's a neat feature!! Like I said, I love Samsung phones!!",1
"How many apps do you think you have on your phone? 40? 50? how about your phone from 2 or 3 years ago? 15-20 tops? LOL ah, yes the days when we got excited to get a few free apps or games on our new phones... alas those days are OVER bro! get you a variation of the moto g device family. Out of the box, she is pretty amazing. I didn't have a single complaint really. Super fast, tons of storage, great camera, new updated apps, lots of customizing, etc. JUST WONDERFUL. After a few months it happened, the dreaded update in April I think it was, maybe March, I now have 400+ apps. (I will attach a pic, it shows 399, there have been about 30-40 more that have trickled in since the initial dump, which took about 5-7 days to finish up... and 75-80% are ""system apps"" (bloatware from any and every carrier in fact.... ALL. OF. THEM.) For example, a bluetooth app for t-mobile, & verizon, & sprint, & metro, && cricket. Before you say, ""just uninstall them and move on!"" - I did. I have. I've factory reset twice and they're just BUILT INTO THE phones disk memory. There simply is no ""delete"" them. Some of them, as duplicatory as they are, messing around with them can still brick up your jawn within a few clicks... and before you even start, you are not a dev... so chill, I mean neither am I... but you just stay out of that menu, that app, and that folder. Really, who knows why they name everything in tech sketchy stuff like ""com.sys.IM-WATCHING-YOU-PAM.000"" and ""<%real/secret/23-LISTENER999>... but anyways... JUST PROMISE ME, YOU WON'T GET INTO THAT APP, OR FOLDER.... okay?So Motorola should reimburse me for having to put myself through IT school to teach myself to operate on this phones guts and remove all these garbage apps manually to create the phone I thought I purchased. All you can do is force stop and disable them. Buuut I still feel like they are gathering data, bc, why wound't they be. Its not just this model either, my partner has the moto g stylus 5g and its even worse on theirs. the play store basically never gets a break from constant updates (and then theres the transferring of precious data to the mother ship)yeaaaa we also had to upgrade our home internet plan and router because of all this. We couldn't both use the wifi at the same time doing anything at all. it was crazy. allllllso the apps are gathering intense amounts of data and ALL WANT crazy permissions that have nothing to do with the app itself. like the calculator wants camera permissions... nuts. The sheer number of apps that require making system changes or having total device control... it was too much. I would almost ask for a refund, but from what I see these days most phones are leaning that direction, making money off our god given ones and zeros.... and then still try and look at us in the eyes while they sputter out the retail price of the next generation of your favorite device. can't even hold it down on a free case or something..THEN - - when you finally get a break from force quitting and removing permissions that, somehow keep TURNING BACK on... you might have a few minutes to enjoy a quick photoshoot. NOPE. the camera app it comes with stinks, it just soooo basic.. so then you think, oh, i'll download a cool camera app off play store... NOPE. theres a fricking governor on the camera. That makes it so NO 3rd party camera app will get full usage of ALL THE MEGA PIXELS YOU PAID YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY FOR (48 megs to be precise, which is overkill, but still, you will be lucky to get to use 10 or 12 MP!!)Seriously. And JUST as google starts conveniently implementing the awesome 2 step verification, and authentication keys.... JUST in time for you to have to answer to your wife about why you don't have as much info in your google takeout as she does... yikes... oh and squeeze on some more of that exact same conversation about your FB activity as well.. yaaaaay.So, let me get this straight... I now have to REMEMBER ALL MY UNIQUE PASSWORDS && double log in, && verify 3 ways, all to check a notification thats just a promotional email about the new apps GEWG will put out next week. AND then FINALLY the google security come forward to say they don't trust my log in (bc i've got a VPN) - - - (from guess who - G1 - duh!) and they really cant tell the difference between MY REAL actual login on my trusted device from what it must assume is a HAKKr logging in 3 states away. . . . . . E.V.E.R.Y. LOG - INNNN!at this point i am thinking about a jitterbug and some stress eating of sour worms to relax.but yeah the phones cool, other than that.",1
"This was my 2x trying Amazon Renewed. This time I purchased the LAST stated available 2023 described as ""In OEM box, Box shows wear from opening"". The Moto Razor Flip phone was described as ""Like new"". Immediately upon arrival w/o even opening the box I knew it was wrong as the package was far too light. I opened it & there was a Moto Razor w/obvious discoloration on the case from use + a CHIP in the bottom screen. Packaging was similar to a top end Samsung I ordered from Amazon Renewed & fulfilled by a 3rd Party in FL 2 years ago. I saved due to credit only $20 @ checkout over a NEW One. WORSE there's NO WAY to return this immediately (There' are 2 Amazon Return 2 locations within 2-5 minutes of my house. Just came back from one & CS stated ""I've never seen this"")). Instead Amazon MAY notify me when they'll ONLY pickup from my house in 3 days.I had this EXACT same problem with a $700+ Laptop that was supposed to be Brand New. I'm beyond a coder or tech guy & ran a battery cycle count software on that as the battery lasted 2 hours less than advertised. It was obviously a RETURN, re-sold as NEW, unless Compaq sells Laptops w/over 200 battery cycles already on them. Same thing w/2 PB's & a CH Android Tablet which still had the previous User's name & account information installed. Seriously, WHO is doing QC? I'll NEVER use Renewed again. Period. Even when you buy a NEW item it's 50/50 now you'll get someone else's return sold as New! eBay here I come again. Worst thing this was supposed to be a gift. OBVIOUS Screen CHIP really ticks me off. Since 2022 I'm now 2 for 8+ on purchases of tech devices. Buy with caution!",1
The system worked well for a few days .Then multiple issues launching any game arose.All games were bought new .Very aggravating.Not sure what to do now .I guess I just threw away money for a game console that barely works .Hope other people have better luck .Take care .,1
"Ever since I got this thing it’s been a source of frustration. It picks and chooses what games it allows me to play. Whenever I put a disk in it won’t read it, it’ll say open tray as of there isn’t even a dick inside. I have to open and close the tray 5+ times to get it to work. Sometimes it doesn’t. Some games it won’t play at all. I have a feeling that whoever inspected this thing before resale just looked it over and said “looks fine to me” and pushed it down the line. Piece of junk",1
"Not sure if I received a defective batch, but this set was horrible. All the “slimes” were sticky like glue and watery. Not useable. Waste of money.",1
"Well where do I begin? The tray door wasn't opening, handled that. It's not playing any of the games at all. This game system specifically said in good condition not seeing that at all. It's not even reading any of the games at all. So basically I just wasted $367 so I definitely feel like I have been scammed. This is so ridiculous. Ordered through Amazon I thought was a reliable place. Never had any problems before through them. So I figured why not? Well this is the absolute last time I'll be ordering anything that's refurbished or used. This is pure junk Xbox 360. Wasted my money and time. So thank you for that.....I hope this helps the next buyer plz beware of the scams.",1

"The media could not be loaded. Ok, I’m so confused. I didn’t open this for a couple weeks after getting it while I was finishing my last bottle. The seal on the bottle was intact. Unfortunately now I’m outside of my window to return.This was the worst experience ever. At first it was bright purple, for a few days. But even while purple… it felt clumpy and silicone-like.

It just breaks into smaller chunks and won’t stick to your teeth.I included a video of how it has turned brown and continues to stay that way no matter how much I pump out of it… looks like it’s oxidized?

I also didn't realize until I READ on the product info itself that the effects you might get if you're lucky will be for ""that day only""... purple cancels out yellow or something like that. This is a gimmick and was a complete and total waste of my good money. Can I get my money back? Please, I bought 2 bottles. I can send them both back one unopened.",1
The purple toothpaste does not dissolve (lather up). Good fall into sink from mouth while brushing.The purple color makes it appear whiter for a few moments only. Used for about 2 weeks. Waste,1
Don’t buy this buy Mint InstantPurple Color Corrector with nHAp. I haven’t bleached my teeth in a year since using that. I tried this to save money big mistake. This doesn’t even bring out the white at nothing. Plus the dispenser pull gadget inside became unhooked so it doesn’t work I have to shake the paste out after four days. Pure garbage.,1
I tried this product and can confirm that it does not preform as advertised. Day to day use did nothing to help improve the look of my teeth.If anyone has had any experience that was better than mine then great for you.,1
This product rendered useless as the product doesn’t pump out and there was no straw in the pump like most purple teeth whitening products in this category.,1
An explosion of toothpaste from every crevice but the one intended,1
It’s either very loose or just doesn’t fit. Trash.,1
I tried this product hoping it would do what it says. But I didn't notice any change at all. This was a waste of my money.,1
Received the tube- it felt liquid when I picked it up to use- so I shook it quite a bit. Opened a bunch of liquid squinted out everywhere. put cap back on and shock it- get a little bit of pasty white material like toothpaste. Has been ongoing issue- tube usually only squirts liquid so it does not stick to toothbrush. Can't return it. Waste of Money. Going to make m y own!,1
"This was our favorite toothpaste. Long lasting clean feeling and nice minty gel flavor. Since crest added the tarter protection (in very small print), the toothpaste is watery, no gel minty taste and doesn't clean as it did before. I bought Colgate for the first time ever. Just not the same.",1

"I was only able to use this product once and then it stopped working. It was great the one time I used it as it helped flush out my ear as I had an ear infection. I have charged it, the light turns from red to green and when I go to use it, it doesn't turn on.",1
"I purched this item along with some of the Pink Stuff, and did not use the brush before my return date expired. When I loaded the batteries it failed to turn on. OK, Pionk Stuff produce is good, so I order a second brush and when it arrived the packaging was damaged, but I tired it anyway just to see if this one worked. Same issue - unit would not start. Changed the batteries and it still would not start. Sending the 2nd one back for a replacement and will see how that works out. If it doesn't start I will just return it and look for another option. Obviously the manufacturing quality control is missing...",1
"I have used the attachment specifically to clean dirty grout in my tile floors and that was barely works. It comes with a lot of attachments for other types of cleaning I haven't tried them yet, but feels cheap...",1

"The product was good in concept, however, the head of the product keeps coming unscrewed from the pole, no matter how hard I tighten it. It doesn't get in the grooves very well. Seems like it would be great for someone it just need minor surface dust removed and does it on a very regular basis. But built up dust and dirt only gets moved around. Sad I spent the money in it. 😒",1
This product is AWFUL! It DOES NOT PEEL OFF easily or in one piece. I tried it last week and followed the instructions. It took my 45 minutes to peel tiny little pieces off before I just got in the shower to wash it all off. Last night I decided to give a second chance and left it on much longer this time allowing it to set. SAME issue. I was smarter this time though and did not spend all that time picking at it. It also made my skin much more irritated.,1

These do not work at all! I wish I did not have to give them any stars! I need anywhere between a .5 to 1.25 reader depending on whether I’m wearing my contacts or not so I was so excited to try these. I put them on and could not read ANYTHING! They were so blurry. I kept them on for a bit to see if they’d adjust and they never changed at all. They are going back and I am leaving this review so no else wastes their time or money on these.,1
"These are cheap, I guess you get what you pay for. They fit over glasses and do provide a view while laying flat. However it is very uncomfortable on your face and disorienting because of how the reflection is displayed, and I don't know if I just received a bad pair but the lenses were scratched. Also, they can't be returned, I don't know if there's a better option but this pair is not a good one.",1
"Too heavy to use,not good for Using laptop. It adds extra pain in your reading during lying in bed.",1
My lens fell out. Within my first minute of having it. The lens just fell out.,1
I got these for reading and they were so insanely heavy they caused a headache right away. I returned them.,1
We followed the instructions but this does not stick on with water as promised. Then when we went to return them we dicovered that the return window was only a month — since we weren’t going on vacation until next week we didn’t try putting them in and it expired by a week. :(,1
Feel cheaply made and a little heavy. Difficult to use if you wear glasses already. Have to lie way back or hold book way down at an odd angle to use well.,1
Poor quality didn’t expect much but didn’t expect this cheap. Like something you’d win at skee ball!,1
"The picture represents the glasses as is. i.e. The Bifocal piece is just that, a glued on bifocal. Too small. The sunglasses were very light and flimsy. Would not recommend.",1
I ordered these to better able to see my instruments while riding my motorcycle. They are hard for me to see anything through top or bottom. Not a good choice for me.,1
"The description of this product says ""Fits most glasses."" ON WHAT PLANET???Total waste of money.",1
"I have narrow eyeglasses and these sit in the top third of those lenses. They are basically unusable. The picture online doesn't show a correct image. I would guess it was placed with a distortion. It doesn't show how really narrow, top to bottom, these clip-ons really are. I don't know what to do with them. I guess I'm just out the money.",1
Make sure you know your range. I needed a higher range than what was advertised.,1
"Hinges break in two weeks ,they are very weak",1
Love the thought of the multi vision however the plastic lenses that I received were foggy and barely useful. It’s unfortunate as I did purchase a pair locally and had I not lost them… they were clear and functional.,1
It's a great item it's just that I can't use it with the lens scratched.,1
I don’t write reviews typically but these were pretty bad. Besides being scratched on one lense they were very poor quality. I paid much more than I usually do for a cheap pair of reading glasses and they were comically bad. Creaking plastic frames that were not angled correctly (too wide) when open so that I had to bring them back in to meet my head. Loose lenses that were not fit well to the frame. Not asking for much but for around $25 I expected them to at least be usable. Also suspect I’m not the first to return this pair.,1
"First it arrived much later than expected. It was just packed in a clear plastic bag, no cover at all. Then I went to open the arms to try them on and the hinge broke. Very disappointed. Had wanted to have a retro looking pair of reading glasses, I guess it wasn’t meant to be.",1
I bought two pairs and both broke from normal wear.No return option.Waste of money.Bad product!,1
Broke within a couple weeks of light use. Disposable quality.,1
"I bought these again because the side ear pieces stretched and I needed a new pair. Its been less than a year, and I ordered these again and the quality of the glass is horrible. DISTORTED! When I look down it makes me feel like Im 2 ft from the ground and I am not a toddler. Something really wrong with these.",1
Sorry but they don't work.,1
"The stems are somewhat short and the lens frame is a bit delicate (not surprising given the website photos and the fact that their wireframes), but the glasses are nice and lightweight. Unfortunately, the magnifying strength of the lens is a bit weak. I ordered a 2.0 lens and received them labelled at 2.0, but they seem closer to a 1.75, meaning they're a bit soft in terms of focus.",1
Disliked seeing fuzzy put over prescription glasses for the computer @ work I can see clear,1
"They do have lights. They are cute. But I got a book out in bed, which is why I wanted these, and put on these glasses to aide. I had to turn on light from iPhone to see the words. Hugely disappointed.",1
The attachment of the temple hinges is defective. I was replacing a broken pair I had for several years on which the hinges fit properly. Both replacement pairs have the same problem. I feel that these will break in a short period of time.I would recommend not ordering these glasses.,1
"I didn't like the glasses because it seems like the lens are inserted upside down! It is very difficult to see, I turned the glasses upside down on my face and now I can see close up!",1
The lenses and price on these glasses are awesome BUT I will not recommend as the frames break very easily when cleaning and I went through both pairs in 2 months so with that said I will never buy these again.,1
"Cheap packaging, arrived with right lens off",1
Avoid. The tag on the glasses marked them as defective store seconds. The lenses were scratched. To return them Amazon wants me to drive to a store many miles away.,1
"Worst readers that I have ever owned. Cheap frames designed to fit Shrek's head, so they fall off normal sized head, and optical quality is terrible. Don't waste your money.",1
"I'm not that gentle with eyewear, so should avoid plastic frames. Temple hinge broke off the rim.",1
These glasses are supposed to be adjusted for the user’s vision. The frames and lenses were cheaply made and I could not adjust them to improve my vision. Sent them back. Would not recommend anyone to purchase these glasses.,1
Do not waste your time and money on this expensive gimmick. IT'S WORTHLESS!!!,1
They're so poorly made it probably cost them less than $1 to make them. And look what they're selling them for! And they don't even work. Junk! Junk,1
"Not useful per any one need more 1.5 and only small face can use ,,,, very bad quality",1
Looks good. No leaks but this is NOT as advertised as being able to hook up to most reverse osmosis water filters which is why I bought it so save more counter top space. I have reached out to the sellar to try to troubleshoot shoot but no response,2
"For garden display but most of the time , the light didn’t on .",2
"I never received the package, after three attempt I cancel the order. more than a month later the refund never been made and Affirm start charging my account today. please send my refund ASAP.Thanks!",2
The XBOX console was in good shape externally but would not read my game discs. I took my discs to a local game store and their original XBOX console was able to read all of them.,2
"Was easy to set up for my daughter. Can't go wrong with a hundred dollar(the suggested retail price) phone that does everything the others do.It's a bit slow, but works lol.Very very slow.Feel over charged at 200$ not a good buy. Id return it but Im too late.",2
"Looks good but I was expecting 2 controllers And A headset. That's what they advertised when I got ahold of am. Azon, they were like sorry, yet their personal guarantee is on this that you will get everything so disappointed.",2
Yep 360S had some internet connection issues which forced me to buy the adapter which is fine. But major problem is some OG Xbox disc CAN play on this but you need the original official hard drive that contains the code. Which forced me to buy and hunt for a new official hard drive ! The hard drive in the picture is a knock off version which contains no special code ……,2
"Just arrived, colours are not as advertised. Ordered only because the jelly fish was blue, however it does not have blue at all.",2
Not worth the hype in my opinion. There was VERY little difference in the before and after for me and my daughter.,2
Not worth the hype in my opinion. There was VERY little difference in the before and after for me and my daughter.,2
I bought this item because of the 5 star reviews.I’ve used this several times with absolutely no difference in my teeth color. I would not recommend.,2
"I was super excited to try this carbon toothpaste that also whitens! The packaging is great and the color of the paste is pleasing to the eye. Here's the thing though, I don't think I'm the target demographic because it did nothing for my teeth. I'm trying not to blame the product because my teeth are pretty stained from when I smoked for years and also coffee. So I didn't notice any significant or even insignificant change to the color of my teeth when I used this but when I switched back to my usual whitening toothpaste, I of course noticed it immediately. Perhaps someone without the wear and tear of my dental history will have better luck. This could work on someone with only light staining on their teeth but unfortunately not for me.",2
"Tastes of grape, that's all, doesn't whiten teeth",2
It did not attach to the toothpaste tube tight enough.,2
"The product comes out as a foaming mess that has a disgusting feeling in the mouth. I tried it anyway, to give it a chance. Absolutely no difference in teeth color than before. Don't waste your money.",2
The seal was broken and the product was very moist from humidity and I will not be using.,2
If I had seen that these tablets were foaming toothpaste tablets I would not have purchased them. I ended up having to go to the store to purchase some without that ingredient.,2
"I expected that each eye would adjust as needed; however, the one eye that I needed improvement appeared to adjust but my other eye, without any sight problem, also adjusted so now I have the same problem but the other eye. Cheaper to keep as back up then return.",2
The autofocus works fine. I just had cataract surgery 4 weeks ago and the second eye last week so I couldn't focus to even use my cell phone. The glasses are cheaply made but will hopefully last for 5 more weeks until my prescription ones arrive.,2
"GOOD QUALITY LENSES BUT THE FRAME IS BROKE IN A MONTH, LIKE I'VE BOUGHT CHEAP QUALITY. VERY DISAPOINTED , SOMETHING WENT WRONG WITH MATERIAL THEY STARTED USE , HAD MY OTHER PAIR FOR YEARS AND IT TOOK A BEATING, THIS TIME VERYWEAK CONSTRUCTION",2
The lens came off several times and I ultimately lost one of the pait. The lenses were meticulously cleaned before installation. They worked well until the lens fell out Disappointed!,2
Too Heavy,2
"While I measured carefully, the clips were too narrow for my glasses so I returned them. Lesson learned--seller refunded less than half of the purchase price.",2
"I need very light reading correction (0.5), which these claim to help since they range 'automatically' from 0.5-2.5 in strength. At a normal reading distance for me, everything is very blurry with these on, there is no 'auto' adjusting. The product name also mentions ""multi flex focus dial"". I don't know what 'multi flex' is supposed to mean, but I can tell you there is NO focus dial. As far as I can tell they are plain 2.5 strength readers, which, for me, is way too strong. Color me disappointed and shame on the seller for keyword stuffing their product name with incorrect info.",2
AFTER OPENING THE PACKAGE AND CHARGING THE GLASSES I PUT THEM ON AND THEY SCRATCH MY NOSE. I CHECKED THEM AND THERE WAS NO NOSE PIECE TO PROTECT MY NOSE. I HAD TO RETURN THEM AND ORDER ANOTHER BRAND.,2
Quality is fine for the price but I look like Mrs Claus. lol. I'm not even that old.,2
"I might have ordered the wrong magnification, but I also didn't like the iridescent coating on the outside of the lenses.",2
The lens automatically fog up when you put the glasses on and I think they are low quality lens. Love the look and the replacement batteries but I will not reorder these.,2
"I decided to try bifocals for my first readers, hoping they’d save me from constantly taking them on and off. Unfortunately, they didn’t quite work out. The reading focal area is way too low, which makes it uncomfortable and awkward to use. The focus area is oddly positioned and doesn’t blend well with the rest of the frame, making it look unattractive. While they’ll do in an emergency, the quality just isn’t there. I ended up switching to a different brand with progressive lenses for a much better experience.",2
I've been wearing Foster Grant reading glasses for years and always purchase the same model. The glasses that I ordered were to be Ironman IronFlex black/red framed glasses. Instead of shipping the ordered glasses I was sent unframed glasses blue/grey#dg1123 IM1001 GUN. I was to receive IM2002 model but didn't. Caution buying these glasses.,2
I purchased these to replace my previous pair of the same glasses. These seem to be much larger and kept falling off my head/face. Will be returning these.,2
This is the third pair of these exactly same glasses that I’ve purchased. This pair was loose at the temples on arrival and tightening didn’t resolve the issue. Kept because they arrived at Christmas just before traveling out of town,2
Don’t waste your money on these glasses! Worn for reading only and the lens falls out! The arms are extremely tight. Very flimsy.,2
I dislike the feeling of wearing them and seeing outside the frames and inside. It was very odd and disconcerting. I returned them. They made you dizzy looking up.,2
Cannot wear for a long time as edges are hard. Have to line up perfectly as not to have double vision.,2
I braved the bright morning commute sunshine to test these. (I'm just a passenger) No shading at all. Yes I gave them time sat them on my dash too. No luck. Painful. Wearing my polarized sunglasses I could see some slight rainbow staring on the edges but not enough to tint the lenses. Also the bifocal line is really pronounced right in the middle of my eyeline - and maybe that's just the size of my face I have a smaller head. If you zoom in on my pic you can see what I'm talking about. I could still use inside or at home but only while specifically reading. I don't think I could walk around with the bifocal line.,2
Attempted to catch them from falling from my face and they snapped in 2..,2
Doesn’t cool at room the size it says it does:-(,2
"I usually don’t write reviews, especially negative ones. I liked this product when I initially got it. But after using it for only two summers the pump stopped working even with regular cleaning and maintenance. Because the water is no longer pumped into the filter, it does not actually cool anything. It looks like the pump can’t be easily replaced. So I liked it in the beginning but it didn’t last. Now I just use it as a bulky floor fan.",2
Don't recommend it,2
This unit just blows hot air around and doesn’t measure the temp in the room only the temp of air it’s putting out.,2
"The ice packs would melt and warm up fast, and you only felt the cool air when you are about 2 feet or closer. The fan does not blow hard/fast enough.",2
This product cools my from 95 degrees to about 90 degrees if I’m lucky. Save your money and buy an a/c unit.,2
It stays cool for a few hours and then doesn’t. It’s also difficult to clean as you can’t remove the tank.,2
Don’t cool down,2
Does not blow cold air long even with the ice pack in the bottom,2
I ordered this to cool a bed room for my kids. It’s hot and humid.. the AC UNIT needs work and thought this would help but wasn’t worth it and ima have to return.. I don’t feel the difference from fan to AC it’s all the same the humidifier looks like it works as the vents cleaned my air in 1day the filter was getting fDirty,2
The only time you cool off is if you’re right in front of it.I don’t not recommend and SUCH a waist of money!,2
Annoying flashing lights when off. Ice packs swell too much even half full. Good for a small room but not a powerful fan. Can't complain for the price though.EDIT 9/23/2022: Piece of junk now. Swing function quit working. Pump intermittent and indicator light quit working. Cheap for a reason. Would not buy again.,2
"Received this couple months ago doesn't do much ,,fan works better .not advisable for the money very disappointed",2
What a joke! This cooler might cool you if you stand right in front of it. It would not cool 5 square feet let alone 200 square feet. It is a pain in the but you have to have keep filling it with water and ice bottle (which lasts about 25 minutes. 2out of 5!,2
Wouldn’t buy again.1. This doesn’t substitute an air conditioner2. Works with water and electricity3. You need to have it very close to you to get any coolness4. The water only lasts 4hrs,2
It being to squeals badly after about 6 months of use.,2
"It's an okay unit, tales awhile to get cool air out of the unit and the fan isn't very strong even at max.",2
"Customer Service is Priority ONE with this company--A principal from the company personally called me for feedback on the cooler. I experienced what I thought was an incomplete assembled cooler, but after speaking with the principal/owner, it was apparent they made significant improvements to the unit to allow ice to be used in the water, which cools the air about 30 degrees more than normal. Their fan motors are of superior quality, sealed units. I live in Phoenix, AZ where summer temps are record breaking at 118 degrees, we use our Cajun Kooler coupled with our mister system so we can enjoy being outside on the patio. This unit is superior to others we've tried, and I highly recommend it.",2
haven't used yet,2
"This is a cheaply made unit but it works okay for what it is.Before my actual review, I wanted to mention the ice packs because a lot of reviews complain about them. Yes, the ice packs melt quickly. You'll need to keep a few and rotate them through the freezer if you want consistent ice packs. This is not a product flaw. It's just physics. Putting something frozen in water- a heat sink- makes it melt faster than when just on a surface.Now for my actual product feedback.The air that comes out of it, even without ice packs, is definitely cooler than the air that comes out of an ordinary fan.It isn't strong enough to really significantly cool a space, but for a very small space or for the area immediately in front of it, it works reasonably well. It will be much more effective in an arid climate than in a humid one. To counteract this in the humid area I live in, I simultaneously run a dehumidifier.I had it for about 2 days with it working quite well with constant use. Partway through the third day, it started to leak pretty badly. I opened it up and tightened all the internal screws I could reach, then closed it again. Unfortunately, the leak continues. I will be returning this and trying a different model that is hopefully made better.",2
It doesn’t get really cold!,2
"This cooler is not bad, it just doesn’t cool 1100 square feet! Not even close. It’s actually 1100 CUBIC square feet which is not even a 12’x12’x8’ room. (1152 cu ft) The advertising is misleading. It also takes distilled water so the deposits and minerals don’t clog it up. Amazon has 18 gallons for over $60 so that will get you less than 30 hours. If you have a small room or you put that thing right on you, it’s not much better than a good fan.",2
It was working great but the pump diedIn 4 months,2
"The water tank and the ice things. This thing really aint worth it. Just take the plan and you get a portable ac unit Because this thing it works somewhat, but honestly not enough",2
"As the headline said, the boom mic introduces echo and buzzing, the exact opposite of what I'd intended by buying a more expensive headset. Plus, they only record at 16 bit, 48KHz, well below anything reasonable. Save your money and buy a $5 headset if you want the boom mic, because this one simply isn't fit for purpose. The only bright side is the comfort and the audio out, but the difference of $35 between this and the boom-mic headset I got at 5 Below isn't justified for that.",2
"Never mishandled, but after a year of use the microphone only works when placed at a certain angle now and is very inconvenient.",2
The only real issue with the stand is the shaft and piece the headphones rests on. Its very poor quality. I super glued it together and it lasted another couple of weeks before it broke again with simple use. Spend your money elsewhere.,2
Hooked into A40TR and my voice cuts out very frequently to others I am talking to.,2
"This headset didn’t connect with my xbox what so ever, even though it says it is, would be perfect for anything else though",2
"This is a good looking and useful headphone stand but the RGB stopped working after 2 days of use. Already tried to unplug and plug it again, no luck, holding the rgb button, no luck. It just stopped working and it's disappointing after so little use. If I want to return the item I would have to send it with an international courier service because I'm not located in USA, so shipping it back would cost to me like double the cost of the actual item.",2
This is the 2nd one I have purchased and believed it was identical to the other one. There is no mute option. Don't recommend if your kid games as muting is something they all do.,2
Stop working after one day,2
"This headset is comfortable, the audio is good, the battery life is good. I really like that the mic flips up and down and mute itself when you do so. All the things you think about with a headset are on point. I wish I could end the review there, but everything else makes this thing a pain to use.The main reason I went with this is because I already use some other Corsair peripherals with iCUE. Using this headset with iCUE is actively worse than without. First and foremost, when you're not using iCUE, the headset uses a series of beeps to for audio feedback when you mute or unmute. These beeps are very clear, and they vary in tone in a manner that makes it intuitive whether what you just did was to mute or unmute. These beeps sound whether you click the physical mute button or flip the mic up or down. When the headset is controlled by iCUE, these beeps are completely disabled, and you're left with two options: No mute sounds at all, or use the extremely grating voice prompts. Why can't I just hear the beeps? It makes no sense.You can replace the voice prompt audio with your own .WAV files, but what you'll find is that iCUE has a something like a half-second delay in reading custom .WAV files, and even if there wasn't, there's no active audio connection. The audio connection only starts when audio plays, and it takes an additional half-second *after* audio starts for anything to get to the headset, so it cuts off the first half of the audio. In practice, this means if you have a second long audio clip, you'll only hear half of it. If you have a half-second long audio clip, you'll hear nothing. Why send audio feedback through the audio channel instead of playing them natively on the headset? It makes no sense.Note that this is through the USB dongle with a dedicated connection to the headset. I understand that the various versions of Bluetooth will have these latency and cut-off issues, and that's the main reason why I chose this headset that comes with a dongle. Why does the dongle have the same issues that Bluetooth does? Does the dongle use Bluetooth for its connection? If so, then *what is the point of the dongle*? All phones, all laptops, all consoles, and most desktop PCs (mine included) have Bluetooth built-in. Why ship a dongle that has all the downsides of not having a dongle? It makes no sense.Also, when connected through the dongle, infrequently (but extremely noticeably) something goes completely wrong and the microphone audio just totally corrupts. I haven't had the pleasure of hearing it myself, but multiple times have the people I'm talking to started freaking out about how I was getting sucked into a wormhole. When this happens, it doesn't stop, and the only way to get the audio back in working order is to unplug and replug the dongle. Turning the headset off and back on doesn't even work. I don't know if it's a driver issue or what, but I can't risk a losing customer or client trust because my hardware just fails in the middle of something.So throw the dongle out, right? Just use Bluetooth natively. Yeah, I tried that too. The latency issues with the headset are much worse than what I see with other Bluetooth devices, outside of my $5 set of earbuds. This thing is $50 ($100 with the dongle that makes the experience worse), they couldn't have put a better Bluetooth module in it? I've used no-name speakers with better Bluetooth. Why put inferior components in your mid-range device? I'd say it makes no sense, but it's really just cost cutting at the expense of consumers who don't know any better. (Un)Fortunately for me, I do know better.And one last issue, and last because this might just be my system, but when the headset is connected via Bluetooth, Windows Audio Service uses upwards of 5 GB of RAM and some 10-15% of CPU on my 13th Gen Intel i7. I don't see other connected devices, audio or otherwise, using this amount of resources. On top of that, the headset broadcasts itself as multiple different devices, presumably one to connect to the dongle and one (or more?) to connect via native Bluetooth. This makes it really hard to isolate and troubleshoot any issues, because it's not easy to tell if you need to look at ""CORSAIR HS55 WIRELESS Gaming Headset"" or ""CORSAIR HS55 Stereo"" or ""CORSAIR HS55 WIRELESS HANDS-FREE AG"" or whatever else in device manager or sound settings.I put up with all these issues for a month, swapping between connection methods, trying different settings, googling workarounds, convincing myself that there must be a way to make this thing good. After a month, I have found that there is not. There's no way to use this thing that isn't aggressively bad in one way or another. I wish I could pick and choose different aspects of the different connection methods and combine them into a singular, cohesive, and broadly good experience, but it's not possible. And since the return window closes after 30 days, I guess I'll just be out the cash with a bad product that could be good but isn't. If this is the sort of experience I can expect from Corsair, then I guess I know not to get any further invested in the ecosystem.",2
"The media could not be loaded. I bought this yesterday (4/30/23), when I originally plugged it in and set it all up it worked. Today when I set my controller on it the lights in the bar went absolutely insane. I didn’t think much about it and was gone all day. I came back to my controller not charged and the lights still going crazy. I took it off the charger and the lights work fine. I put my controller on it and crazy lights… my phone won’t even charge anymore when plugged into it. Really annoyed, and will be contacting customer service.Update: I got in contact with the company who makes these and they sent me a new one free of charge… I’ve had it 24/hours and it’s working okay. It’s a little wonky when I set my controller down it freaks out but after about 5 minutes it works like normal.. I will give it some more time before I change my review completely or keep it the same. It was nice if the company to send me a new one though.",2
"Received console and accessories as advertised in the description to replace a similar previous refurbished system that was sent back. Upon trying to power up system after making proper connections, found that the controller would not work. Sent everything back for a refund.",2
"Haven’t played the game hooked it up to my TV. Can’t seem to make the controller compatible to the game. It came with the game, but for some reason it’s acting like it’s not compatible so I haven’t played it.",2
The product is not good,2
This item came in the color was distorted. It looks more navy blue and white. Did not look anything like the black-and-white picture shown online.,2
"The paper was very wrinkled and creased and was delivered folded. It would have been packaged with a sturdy piece of cardboard. The paper was also extremely thin (paper meets tissue paper). If the papers were not wrinkled and creased it would have made a decent placemat, but in its current state it looked cheap and I ended up throwing away so many sheets because I couldn't use them for anything.",2
These look cheap. Colors are not realistic. We chose not to use them for our event.,2
"Pros - Placemats are colorful and seem sturdy. Cons - Dozens of errors in the maps. Problems with places being misnamed, colors (sometimes contiguous countries have the same color), the names of cities are larger than the names of states or countries. Names are cut off so you can't read them. These placemats useless for teaching geography, but we are having a lot of fun spotting and discussing errors!",2
Lifeless colors. Returned. Previously a fan of Pimpernel.,2
"Product has edges peeling up after a few weeks, and very difficult to keep these glossy mats looking clean. Poor quality.",2
"Nice print, it is very thin, I don’t think is going to last long, I will have to iron it because it came with wrinkles. Not that happy with them, it looks better in picture",2
Really cheap and thin,2
Product is totally not a placemat. More a coaster!!!! If I was bothered I would return them but as I am incapacitated with a back problem they will be used as very expensive candle base to protect furniture. So disappointed. Just wouldn’t buy them ever!!,2
"Experienced serious performance issues which prompted me to return the product. The issues all involved the Chrome browser. Clicking links on pages, creating new tabs and generally doing anything on the browser stuttered and paused. No other processor intensive activity was taking place, the only thing open was the Chrome browser. The issue went away after a while but I wasn't taking any chances. The experience was so disappointing and I was wary of it happening again that I decided that it was simply best to just return the item.",2
I hardly use the darn thing be it drives me crazy! I needed a new laptop and right now Apple was out of my price range. I am so over & done with windows so this seemed like a nice option. It is very printer fussy. It would work with the one I had but it gave a list of printers that would. I ordered one from that list. Nope. Wouldn't work. I wanted a lighted keyboard. I didn't know that the only lighted keyboard was the touch screen one that insists on popping up constantly when I'm using the other (unlit) keyboard. I really prefer the raised keys of a keyboard over touchscreen for typing. It has some nice features. Holds a charge well. Will store your info so you don't need to enter it yourself but most computers do that. The screen size is nice. But the negatives far outweigh the positives for me. I regret the purchase.,2
"I purchased this unit and really enjoyed it. Even though it was bigger than i normally use, i was going to keep it anyway but unfortunately relentless wifi issues made me return it. Constant disconnects from anything requiring a reliable connection. Amazon luna constantly kicked me out, geforce now and xcloud both had constant disconnects. I couldnt get through a 20 minute zoom meeting without a dozen reconnects. I have other devices, including chromebooks that dont have any issues with my internet. Being a chromebook means i cant swap for another wifi chip leaving me to return. Perhaps it was only my unit but truly unfortunate.",2
"It’s a great buy for the price. There’s no debating that. However, no manual included. I bought it posted as excellent condition. Nothing could be further from the truth. Many scratches on both sides of the keyboard. Surface scratches on the lid. I can actually live with that. Looked like a big dirt stain in the exact middle of the screen. Nope it’s a ding and it’s deep enough to fit the tip of your fingernail. The fact that it actually works is the only thing stopping me from giving one star. I was under the impression this was from Amazon but it’s an individual seller. I’m okay with that but maybe some more transparency and honesty would have me in a better mood",2
"This is advertised as having 64GB storage plus a 64GB MicroSD for a total of 128GB storage. It does come with a MicroSD card and an SD adapter, but there is no place to plug either one in. The instruction sheet shows a location for inserting the card, but that slot does not exist on the computer we received.",2
It arrived without the charger.,2
"This thing was a pain in the neck to set up any software not purchased at the “Microsoft Store.” Even programs that were pre-loaded on the system as purchased could not be activated or accessed without knowledge of how to access the magic handshake that Microsoft support would not provide. I had to go to individual software providers such as McAfee and Adobe to figure out how to enable commonly used programs. Even setting up an existing HP printer was not for the meek..everything defaults through HP’s cloud and, again, no support from HP to enable local print spooling. The speed and user interface is no better than the 8 y.o. Windows 10 system I replaced (forced obsolescence, because Windows 10 won’t be supported past 2025 and many programs already could not be updated). Then there’s this flash-card approach to local storage…what a cheesy way to force users to buy storage space in the cloud. Now I know why iOS and Google based systems are more expensive and likely worth the premium.",2
"This is a very nice and powerful laptop for the price, working well and fast, battery life is not great but fine if you adjust the power setting.The add implies that MS office is included in the laptop, however it is only installed, to use it you can get 30 days free trial (by putting your CC info) but than you must pay.This misleading product info really leaves a bitter taste from this purchase. As a consumer I just want to get what was advertised, nothing less nothing more.",2
"Just like the reviews of this laptop- the hinge cover was missing! As this is for a 13 year old, I am not sure that I want to keep it. With the missing piece, it makes me wonder how long this will last. I gave it two stars because it powers on quickly.",2
I never turned it on or tried charging it. A piece is missing,2
This is the slowest and loudest Chromebook I've ever owned. It will shutdown at random the fan is constantly on. I've not altered the system in any way. I stick to regular updates and maintain recommended security protocols. Super disappointed.,2
"The only good about this chromebook is the Intel Evo 5 processor, the rest is us a Chrome web browser. All android apps will run in phone or tablet mode, but not in full screen. For the money this latptop cost, you can buy two lenove tablet P12 and will have all the same functionaity plus all your apps will run in full screen mode, plus the same browser experience. Chromebook is bulky and abttery life no good at all.",2
"I purchased this after seeing an embroidery digitizer use it in a video online. One of the well-known digitizing software companies even recommends it on its site. While the reviews online seem to vary, I figured at this price it was worth a shot.It arrived quickly. The packaging is okay, though if it had been included in a box with something heavy, I would have concerns about it being protected well enough.The instructions it came with were insufficient at best. They basically say to insert a battery, plug in the dongle to your computer, and the pen will automatically connect as it was paired at the factory. There are no markings on the inside of the pen or in the instructions to tell you which direction to insert the battery.Despite our technical knowledge, neither my husband nor I were able to get this pen to connect to any computer in our household. The wireless mouse I purchased the same day worked just fine though, so that leads me to believe it was a problem with the pen.Holding the pen felt unnatural to me. It's oddly shaped, probably for ergonomics, but it fails in this way.Perhaps others have had better luck, but this is going back and I'll have to do further research on a digital pen.",2
"I have to tap several times or really smash with my index finger to get the to work. Using it properly, by using thumb for left click and pinky for right click is impossible.",2
Keep in a drawer for when the cat chews the cord on your normal keyboard to order another normal keyboard.,2
Cheap. Sits crooked. The water doesn't make a dripping sound like it should. It doesn't come out of the top strongly to create A solid stream. It just dribbles out. Very disappointed.,2
"Worked beautifully for a few months, and then kept slowing down until the ball just finally stopped turning altogether. It also started leaking and I was afraid of damage to my furniture, so I disposed of it. A shame--it was a beautiful fountain.",2
I expected a little more from this brand. The case fits so well and protects the phone. The sides of this case discoloured within the first two weeks of using and now looks very average. Would not purchase again.,3
The set is fine overall for the price. The metal on all knives is rather thin and somewhat flexible. Not the best quality but suitable for home use. The wood block holds all the knives but maybe could have been a darker wood. Like previously mentioned for the price its fine. How they will hold up is a test of time.,3
"This is the lamest product design ever. It does not store easily as advertised because all the stuff that comes with it doesn't fit in it. Not even the manual! I couldn't even figure out how to get it back in the box it came in. So now I have to buy a box to put it all in, so I don't lose pieces and parts. Very, very, very disappointed. This problem could have been easily avoided with a better design for the product, or if they included a plastic box just big enough to store everything in.The cutting area is pretty small, so you have to cut your produce or whatever in half or so, so that it will fit on the cutting area and you can close the unit to do the cutting. Again, lame!!! Again, the problem could be easily avoided by making the product larger in general. That said, it does cut as advertised, at least with the ""garnish blade"".I bought this specifically for making Pico. That means using the small and maybe the large dicing blades. The goal was to have a quicker and easier way to do it, rather than using my big kitchenaid mixer with the food processing attachment. That device does a wonderful job by the way, but our kitchen is very small so my wife makes me store it in the basement. My goal with THIS product was to have something I could keep in the kitchen cabinet.I didn't have everything I needed to make pico tonight, so I used it to make fajitas. I cut onions and three different kinds of peppers with it. For the onion, I had to cut that in half to make it fit in the cutting area so it would cut. For the big bell peppers, I had to cut them in half, and then in half then other way. I really expected better.Overall, the plastic is decent quality for the purpose, as far as I can tell. It also cleaned up fairly easily.I can't comment on its various other functions yet, as I just got the thing yesterday! But that didn't stop Amazon from asking for a review, so here it is.",3
"The product is not heavy but still will serve the purpose for our event. However, no screws were included and need to find replacements.;",3
Came dented and didn’t have enough time before my gathering to get a new one. Otherwise it works fine,3
"I expect a fluffy quilt. This is a flat blanket, nothing more.",3
"I love the scent, but the scent didn’t last. I’ve shaken it and added more stick, flipping everyday. I wish it was better.",3
The media could not be loaded. The color and shelf itself is pretty. I expected to be sturdier for prize. The concept is smart but they needed to add possibly another bar within the shelf to actually support better. Limited use for shelf because when adding additional items the shelf starts to lower in front part and looks like items will fall off and it’s not flush against the wall. I expected more considering price. Very cute design and great if hanging lighter items then books or albums. Great if for Knick knacks. Would not repurchase for my intended use.,3
"When I saw this online, I thought it was cute and decided to buy this as a Christmas gift for my in-laws. However, after receiving it, I don’t think the quality is too good and I’m really disappointed in the magnets. The concept is nice, but the magnets I received are all marked up and chipped. Very disappointing.",3
It's a nice looking decoration. Plastic and smaller than expected. I should have read the complete description but skipped ahead when it was on sale.,3
A bit smaller than I expected,3
"It's a very good computer, very pleasing to the eye. The only problem I have with it is that it's incompatible with the windows 11 upgrade. I honestly thought I grabbed the windows 11 PC but unfortunately I didn't. Besides that little hiccup, it runs smoothly.",3
"Cpu cooler is bad but the pc is good value for the discount, also it is very difficult if you want to upgrade it since the specs are propierty",3
"It's good enough for gaming. RAM, not the best—you could buy more yourself. But looking back, given all of these components this thing is super overpriced. You could build your own for half the price with the same components. Either look for another product or just build your own.",3
For the customers: this is what you should know it does not have a Optical drive a.k.a. DVD player they should put that in the description saying it doesn’t have one but it’s not there it doesn’t say it does or doesn’t either way I want to use it for other things other than gaming the loads really fast in the Internet is really fast when it’s loaded the games take less time to download to my previous computer I played breath edge and it works fine just got hiccups here and there but you can upgrade.this the other problem is there’s no option or any way to put a optical drive in not a single port and that really ticks me off if you didn’t have one it should be advertise not having one and I would’ve went with the $600 one with the warranty about 700 which only had three fans and 250 Megabytes. The only other option is to go in a sternal optical drive a.k.a. DVD player CD player that’s also a pain in the ass you have to make sure that it’s able to read not just burn learned that the hard way make sure you read the descriptions and look for what is and what isn’t mentioned.To the manufacturer: this is borderline false advertisement you should really mention that it doesn’t have one if you’re not going to install it or even an option for someone who buys it to put one in themselves not everyone streams games online some people still get hardcopies that’s something to take in mine I don’t have a problem with the look I do have a problem with not seeing or mentioning certain things in your description for future references this would be best if an external hard drive doesn’t work I will be getting a full refund and I’m going with a different company very disappointed.,3
For old games 100% good but when you got some récent games you gonna surfer. But you know i run obs and my games Steel pretty descent bit it works,3
So everything arrived in time and everything worked BUT the monitor. Like the monitor flashes. Which is sad. My son got creative and used an old tv to connect everything. But keyboard quality is good and everything else but the monitor is good.,3
Looks good. Very compact. Does not upgrade and very limited in what games you can play.So i returned it. Still waiting for my refund. Was sent back over 1 month ago.,3
"I have the series S 500gig from when they came out. The 1tb unit should be just as fast “actually faster” to load since it’s a better read/write SSD BUT ITS NOT. Already tried to exchange it since the Xbox reb said it should run great but they would only exchange it with a refurb. And 90 day warranty when I payed for the year warranty but it’s not transferable or refundable. GOING TO STICK WITH PC GAMING, consoles are just not worth it.",3
It works plays the games but it does like to turn on its own when not it use. Has turned off on its own while using it but not when playing a game.other than that works great,3
"The build quality of this stand is excellent and the lights look great, there are just two issues with it. Firstly, this rubber appendage sticking out at me. I have a wireless mouse so have literally no use for this, I'm able to remove it but now have this ugly gaping hole instead. I may be able to ignore it or try and cover it, but for a premium stand this is a bit daft.However the most irritating problem is that the stand doesn't retain the colour I last set it to. I use a docking station and frequently switch between machines, and every time I do I have to keep pressing the button until I get back to my colour.It may sound like a petty complaint but this isn't the cheapest stand on the market and this is a really stupid problem to have. If my cheap and crappy £10 mousepad from China can do it then I don't see why this can't.",3
"For the price and renewed original Xbox Console, you might think you'd be getting a good deal. Little did I know that the pop-open tray couldn't slide out on the first day of gaming my favorite game, that being the ""Counter-Strike"" Shooter game for the Original Xbox. So I say to myself: either I leave the Disc inside the Xbox, play CS, and make a promise to myself not to break the disk tray even more. Turns out the console works, but no CD Pop-Out capability. Still works fine. Dare I remove that disc for a different game from the Disk tray, and I would be asking for a no longer working Xbox. however the good news I have to share with you all is that I can still play Counter-Strike on the renewed Xbox I ordered, but I can't play other games because I'm too afraid the tray might get stuck and possibly break. So a word to the wise ""If it's broken, but still works, then don't break it anymore."" I guess the Xbox has been around for a very long time. Meaning old products come with defects or some kind of technical problem that can't be fixed. But on a good note, Whenever I look at my turned off Xbox, and see the game controller connected to the console, I get the feeling it's telling me to load up Counter-Strike for one more round. Looking at it, makes me want to call this console, the Counter-Strike Xbox!",3
"After a few days with the phone, I can say that it's pretty sub-par. It's definitely a step up from my previous device, but I honestly expected more from a 5G Galaxy device in 2024.The camera is nice, and the body is solid. The screen is beautiful, visually, but is slow and unresponsive, at times refusing to register taps and swipes.I've owned Galaxy devices before, but the Samsung bloatware on this one takes the cake. Dozens of apps are preloaded that you'll have to either disable or uninstall to get some of the precious memory back, and OneUI is aggressively intrusive, causing compatibility and sign in issues with just about everything you want to use.I suppose this is a case of get-what-you-pay-for, but the user experience seems oddly frustrating, given the promised five years of support.This phone has reaffirmed that the Samsung device environment is not for me.",3
"Product arrived nicely packaged and not damaged with all parts in place. After I hooked everything up I went to open the disc tray and it would not open. This was the exact same issue I had on my previous Xbox 360. After fighting with the disc tray I was able to get open.Xbox would repeatedly “freeze” and become unresponsive. Only way to correct issue was to unplug power.Do yourself a favor and either don’t buy, or make sure you get a warranty. I was able to return mine and the seller was very easy to work with on the refund process.",3
Not enough storage to keep 10 games on it and expansion storage is as expensive as console and external hard drive you have to move games back and forth to play,3
"After purchasing the ""3 Tube"" lamp; I went on to get the ""Shark"" and the ""Jellyfish"" lamps and neither had the USB or battery power sources. Also they didn't have the touch button to change the colors. Still a cool little light sculptures but I got a definite sense of El Cheapo. If this doesn't bother you then go ahead with the purchase. For my use, the USB &a battery setup was a major consideration, and I probably would not have bought the other 2 had I known, but all 3 models were in the same product description.",3
This product looks nice but I find it too bright to be used as a night light. I could also not find a dimmer switch that worked to dim this lamp.,3
"His foot ripped off, leaking sand everywhere. No way to fix it.",3
"Was very hopeful that this product would reduce the coffee stains on my teeth. After applying the toothpaste and scrubbing and scrubbing, I couldn't get the purple off that had stained the tartar in between my teeth. It took a couple more intense sessions to fade the purple. There was some fading on the stains on the surface of the teeth but didn't want to look like a Halloween ghoul so did not continue to use.",3
is ok not what expected,3

Great product.,3
"This toothpaste gets your teeth clean. I find that other natural toothpastes don’t get your teeth as scrubbed clean like the usual Colgates, Crest, etc. toothpastes, however, this one did. The purple color was did not stain your teeth and it actually lathers up well and turns white. The taste wasn’t off-putting and wasn’t too mild nor too overwhelming. I don’t know if it whitened my teeth much, but one of my friends told me that for teeth whitening toothpastes to work you actually have to let them sit on your teeth for at least 15 minutes each time you brush. I am trying to implement that into my daily routine. For the price, and compared to other whitening toothpastes, I don’t think the price is worth it.",3
"So, I have been using this toothpaste for about 2 months now. Not really seeing any whitening effects, but otherwise really like it. Nice flavor, gentle on my gums, teeth feel clean. No bad morning breath. But this is dang expensive to not whiten my teeth. Likely won't reorder at this price",3
"It’s ok, it I like the pastier ones better. This is the equivalent of foamed hand soap as opposed to regular hand soap. Will look for a different one next time",3
"Used with both Crest and Colgate toothpastes. Instead of a screw-tight fit, the cap will begin to just spin. That said, if you tighten to just before it starts spinning, then it work fine. Just be aware that it's essentially still an open tube so toothpaste will dry a bit over time.",3
Doesn’t fit my grandsons toothpaste tube,3
"The formula definitely offers a very temporary Whiteness to teeth, but sadly does not last further than a few minutes.There is also no cleaning component within the foam.Although it does taste quite nice and gives an immediate whiteness, the product does not live up to the hype.",3
I didn’t notice a difference with my teeth. Not pleased.,3
"It’s not “unflavored,” it’s sweetened with sorbitol. My bad, should have read the ingredient list. Otherwise, I like it: a little foam, a good clean feel to my mouth.",3
"Usually love Colgate, but this toothpaste has a runny consistency and my daughter gets it all over the place. She loves the flavor, but I am not a fan.",3
Lovely taste.. Kids love it.. But oh my the price is ridiculous. Won't be buying this again.,3
Got this after watching videos and seeing reviews of how great it works. I have been using it for over a week now and see no difference in the whitening of my teeth. The paste also globs up on my teeth and doesn't distribute evenly. Don't trust purple tooth paste.,3
"This was too gritty, got stuck between my teeth and I needed to floss and rinse after brushing. The flavor was good and my teeth felt clean but i just can't get over how gritty it is.",3
"I barely got into toothpaste tablets and tried out NOBS really like it so I seen these at a better price, but very brittle and my mouth didn’t feel so clean after. I would use 3 tablets just to feel clean.",3
"The media could not be loaded. My ear canals must be very clean, because nothing came out while using this, except the irrigation water. I heated the water to 98° F. Never use cold or hot water to irrigate your ears. It should always be around body temperature. This product has 4 streams of water and different levels of pressure. The pressure was good, but no ear wax came out. I really wanted to like this, but after using it, my ears actually felt plugged. Two hours later and lots of q-tips trying to soak up the moisture, my ears still feel plugged. From now on, I will leave ear irrigation to the professionals.",3
works ok doesnt have as much pressure as i hoped however i do understand why too much and water would shoot out the my other ear,3
"I think I was expecting more because of the brand. It would be nice if the chambers marked which ways the batteries went in. The product doesn’t feel solid. Seems cheaply made and, it’s really loud. It would also be nice if there were a carry case or bag for the brush heads.",3
"I have mixed feelings about this ear wax camera. I thought maybe I would be able to see down my ear canal to the eardrum, but that is not possible because the canal curves. Also, the scraper sits in front of the camera and would need to be way down the canal before the camera could see. I don’t feel this is safe to put down the ear canal. The metal scrapers included with the kit are definitely not safe. Don’t put this stuff down your ear canal! Leave that to doctors.Now the mixed feeling part is because the camera is actually pretty cool. You can see things really close up. It functions like a low power microscope displaying on your phone. I ran it across my skin and could see every pore and every hair and every blemish in super close detail. Creepy looking honestly. I was able to see around the sides of my teeth close up. I could see the individual pixels on my TV screen. You get the idea. The app takes pictures and video too.",3
"This does work, but only for a few minutes before the water runs out. I will only get it out for small jobs. I personally really don't like having to stop and wait for the cool down and then the heat up to only get to work for a couple of minutes.That being said, I have never used a steamer before and I was able to quickly understand what to do to get this working. The instructions are pretty well written. Not perfectly clear, but good enough.The included measuring cup is very convenient as it is marked with the maximum amount of water you can put in.I tested mine on buildup in a shower. I tried it out on glass shower doors and on the bottom of the tub and on some grout. I did need to learn to go slower with it and let the steam do its job. I do think I will get better at it over time. If I can be patient enough to wait through the process.",3
"I bought this to help me clean my showers because of my hands. It is easy to use, but it does not clean the way I was hoping. The Speeds are ok, but the top speed you really have to hold on tight. Also I had to put a lot of pressure to scrub, still it did not clean the build up in my shower. I would like to have at least one cleaning head with harder bristles for the more harder cleaning. After I charged it the first time I've used it 3 times for about 15 mins. and it's still working so I guess the battery is pretty good. I think I'm going to keep it to wash my cars or some mild cleaning.",3
If I could have tested this product before buying I would not have purchased. It doesn’t do a great job and cleaning the base boards like advertised. It doesn’t bend at the bottom so it’s hard to maneuver to me. It also keeps coming detached from the bottom while using. Not my favorite! May return.,3
It is easy to apply with your hands but I prefer using a small plastic spoon. It dries well and it's easy to peel off leaving the skin firm. Its gentle on the skin and gets the dead skin off. The only bad thing is the freshly applied gel sting the eyes a little bit at first when it's less than 1 in from your eyes. After a sec it's OK. Would prob test another peel off mask before buying again.,3
"My skin feels nice enough after using this mask but there are two big cons that make me hesitant to reorder this.1. You need to use a fair bit to create a thick enough layer that doesn't break off into bits while removing it.2. It has a very strong, glue like smell. It's really overpowering and having to put so much on your face doesn't help.I'll keep using it but I'm not sure if the results I gain are significant enough to justify the cost and cons.",3
"I tried to make a picture of how it feels to look through these things. As a novelty, they work well, but for any serious reading, the tiny size of the viewing windows are a constant detriment. I would recommend you keep looking for a horizontal reading solution. The technology is not there yet. Larger prisms, a wider nose bridge, and more plastic material around the frame edges would improve these a lot.The prisms are quite small, measuring about 27mmx44mmx32mm; apparently, you're hard-pressed to find any silvered prisms larger than this, which is a real pity. With larger prisms and a larger viewing window, these could be great for reading books from a comfortable distance, and not with the text in line with ones nipples.This means that the actual portion of my field of view that the image takes up is not even 40%. This might be able to be improved, if the nose bridge were not so extremely narrow so that you cannot slide them all the way on your face. I do not have an exceptionally large nose, or maybe I do; I cannot put these on my face nearly far enough to close out all the exterior sights and shadows. I have worn large over-the-glasses shades before, and they shut out the light nicely around the edges of my vision. These are too small to do so. They are perched on my nose like Ben Franklin reading spectacles.There is ghosting on the viewing image, like when you put your face very near a mirror and can see a slight... ghostly image. This is probably unavoidable due to the nature of light refracting through a prism, but still detracts from the reading experience considerably when there is a superimposed mirror ghost image over the bottom half of the book. I have tried to show this in my mockup photo.There is an upside-down image above each eye, which is even more distracting than the superimposed ghost image. This does not seem to be avoidable either.They fit over my glasses nicely, which I didn't expect. That is nice, because in contrast to one reviewer's husband's experience, I CANNOT see in focus through these without my glasses.The sides of the prisms are shiny, and having three large vertical whitish bars is also rather distracting when reading. There might not be any way to make these less obtrusive, but a matte finish or different color or angle might improve this aspect.",3
"These are the best readers I've come across yet, being autofocus is the best! The only problem I have is the quality of the plastic in the frames because they don't last they crack and fall apart so the price reflects that by many it's still worth the money.",3
"What does auto focus means? Not what I was thinking, these are simple reading glasses.",3
Good for reading,3
The glasses are very heavy and not real comfortable but the idea of them is still good.,3
"It does work, but it does mess with youMakes you feel weirdLittle dizzyI just didn’t like how I felt after I used it for a little bit",3
"I was actually excited to try this item, simply for the novelty of such a product and also because, well, let’s face it… I’m lazy. I’ve only used these glasses once or twice while laying bed so I could watch TV while also reading during the commercials, and I don’t think I’ll be keeping them because they aren’t really good for long-term, practical use.As far as ‘periscope’ vision goes, the glasses didn’t seem to provide as steep of an angle as I was expecting, therefore I was a bit disappointed.It was certainly interesting to try, but it felt a bit awkward wearing them and it was disorienting/dizzying and almost nauseating for me to have them on for more than a few minutes at a time. The glasses don’t exactly provide the crispest vision since you’re viewing a reflection of an image, so naturally it’s a bit discombobulating.And of course anyone wearing these looks absolutely ridiculous – I felt like I looked like Mr. Krabs from SpongeBob 😂So in summary, this would make a great gag gift or stocking stuffer as long as you don’t take it too seriously or expect too much from it.",3
"- Light & works as intended.- Though the area the glass covers is small, so I’m able to see surrounding area, which is kinda annoying.",3
"I was hopeful that these would work well. I wanted to put them on a couple sunglasses that do no have a bifocal magnification. With all honesty - I was disappointed. I followed the directions as given - and I have a great pair of Ray Bans with flat lenses - they are just not 'sticking' like I had hoped. With a 2.50 magnification, they are also a little thicker than I had expected. They DO help with reading.Will they work in a pinch? Maybe......I'm a little nervous to wear them for fear the magnification lens will fall off. I purchased two sets - so I'll try them and see what happens. Not horribly confident, though.",3
"There are problems with multiple reflections, they're also too heavy to wear for long. A clever idea that's too hard to execute.",3
Worked great to blocking sunlight. Almost impossible to read through the dark magnifying portion of the lens.,3
I had planned on wearing these glasses only for looking at the GPS instruments in my airplaneThe glasses are as advertised but as I don't normally wear glasses I had to purchase a pair of glasses with no magnification to connect the flip glasses to. I find this uncomfortable to have to wear glasses all the time rather than only when needed.If possible I would like to order a pair of flip down glasses of the same 2.5 power that connect to the peak of a baseball style cap.Please let me know if you have a product like this in stock.ThanksRobert Moran,3
"They are OK (lenses are reasonable quality), but I managed to break the clasp on the first day. My fault, but ....",3
They were cheap but not very helpful,3
"I love this idea and use these glasses, but this is the 4th set I've owned because the batter flaps are flimsy and they break easily. These are pricy for that sort of failure, but there are incredibly useful, so I keep buying them despite their high failure rate. I gotta say, as soon as I find a more durable set of reading specs with lights I'll switch to those. These are cheaply made.",3
"Well first off I am NOT impressed by the packaging. Mine arrived wrapped in bubble wrap taped up so tightly that they had to be cut open. I was so worried I was going to cut the glasses and I came VERY close to getting the cord. Glasses are not as bright as I was hoping for/expected. Glasses are not as crisp as expected.However, they do work well for the price. I highly recommend upgrading packaging. I would give you an extra star if ANY of the above were better. But it would be too much effort to return them at this point. <shrug>",3
Nice glasses but too expensive,3
"I suppose you get what you pay for. I can use them as an extra pair but I would never order them again. I thought they were an ""oversized"" style.... they were listed as an oversized. But they're not. I like the color but that's about it.",3
These readers are light and comfortable but not meant for people who are rough on glasses. I love they are frameless but not sturdy enough for me,3
Bend easily,3
I like the sunglasses one the most because when looking at my phone in the sun I could actually see it.,3
I've been wearing progressive lenses for 30+ years. These are not progressives and I was unable to adjust.,3
"These progressive lenses really work well, but after 4 months 2 pairs (of the 3 in the order) have already broken. I've just received the second order and we'll see how long they last.",3
"I was so excited when I saw these. I spend my day swapping between .75, 1.0, (computer screens) 1.25 and 1.50 (on the work floor, First Aid applications). I also use a 2.50 for tiny work but I don't wear them regularly. I'm an EH&S manager so I'm always changing safety glasses depending on the situation with which I have to contend and most of my glasses are ANZI diopters. I thought these might be perfect for office work.These are so close but the focal length is strange. I ordered the 1.5's thinking the 1.5 would be on the bottom and digress as your eyes moved up the lens. The top part of the glasses is about a .5. I'm not sure what the middle is but I suspect it's supposed to be somewhere between a .75 to and 1. I find myself nodding up-and-down and moving back-and-forth trying to find the prefect spot for what I am doing. Even still, I can't seem to get a clear picture and the computer font can look doubled.I'm typing on my PC now (obviously) and I've just reverted back to my trusty, basic 1.0's, positioned close to the end of my nose and do the over-the-top-of-the-fame-peek when someone comes to the door.",3
"I thought they might be ""do-all"" driving glasses (distance, GPS, distance, GPS) but the grading is pretty steep so you only can use a fraction of the overall aperture for any particular thing.Oh, well. It was an idea.",3
This isn’t their fault but I was hoping to switch the prism to look up and they're firmly attached.,3
"These glasses work awesome and I wish I could have kept them. Unfortunately I have a small face and a small nose and they just kept sliding off, especially as they are on the heavy side. They did fit my step dad so they would work for some people.",3
"Not as I expected, I ordered this after reading the reviews, awful for reading.",3
Because I have cataract surgery I have new lenses in my eyes when I looked through the upper part of the glass it’s blurry I presume it’s because my lenses work better than the lenses in the glasses,3
"Basically, they took sunglasses and pasted on a little corner of bifocal. Talk about disappointing don’t waste your money.",3
Very cute but very cheap plastic.,3
This item is inferior to two SAV Sportex readers I have previously acquired. It is much less substantial with the thickest part of the frame half the size of my previous Sportex glasses. It doesn’t fit comfortably. Always feels like it is ready to fall off. Previous glasses were so comfortable it was possible to forget you were wearing them. I can’t recommend the current version of this product. Fortunately I still have one of the good Sportex glasses.,3
I've bought these before from my pharmacy and was very happy with them . These though are very flimsy in the ear area.. they cheapened them ...,3
"Not sure if its just my small head...but these are sturdy yes, which makes them hard. not flimsy glasses. They are snug on the nose and behind the ears...well more so ontop of the ears where they lay tends to be uncomfortable after a while. same with the nose piece. Other than that these are great for when you're laying down and want to read and not strain your neck",3
They a really cute bifocals but the do not darken in the sun.,3
"My first pair lasted a year when it unexpectedly broke, I had really liked them, so I bought a 2nd pair to replace it. THAT pair lasted only 5 months, when the frame broke in EXACTLY the same spot. But then the company sent we a replacement for free, so we'll see how this pair lasts.",3
"Lightweight and comfortable, but break easily. That said, its almost impossible to scratch them. I've bought multiple pairs because I keep breaking them, but I still go back to them because of its other good qualities.",3
"It seems like a better solution, right? You don't have to have a pointy 60-lb metal object hanging out your window. Easy to roll around etc.But it's not a better solution.1. In order to blow hot air out the window, the air has to come from somewhere. It's called negative pressure. This AC sucks air in from other rooms, from around your door frames etc. Warm air. So while it's cooling your room, it's also sucking warm air in from the rest of your house.2. The condenser condenses water. Unless you locate it near a drain, a unit like this has nowhere to send the water--so it just puts it back into the air. So you get a very MOIST environment. Like water is condensing on the unit and making little puddles.3. The compressor is noisy--and now it's inside your room rather than hanging out the window.4. It takes up valuable floor space.I suppose this unit is fine for what it is. But a good window unit will beat it 10 days out of 10.",3
"This works well as a fan, but is actually quite loud even on the lowest setting.The cool setting uses the water in the basin, which is terribly difficult to fill, since no funnel is offered and the fill spot is way at the bottom, inside a panel, which is also a bit tough to remove. Try that with a gallon jug.It got so thick in the air, with moisture, but didn't especially cool the place off. The only saving grace was the direct fan. Honestly.",3
"At this price point it’s not worth it. I mean, the fan is not bad, the water makes the air coming out cooler, but it won’t cool down the room and lower the temperature. It even says on the box that it won’t make your room cooler. It’s just a strong winded, loud (!) fan that is nice as long as you’re right in front of it. On hot days when we put it in our bedroom and close the door it’s like walking into a humid hot pool house a couple hours later. Oh! And it makes screeching sounds when it reaches lower water levels so you don’t get the stated hours of use out of it. Buy a cheaper fan, this ain’t worth it.",3
"THE GOOD: The front grid is more solid than the previous model. If you fill it with Ice and Water, it does help to cool....but only if you add ice. If you just fill with water it is no better than a fan. It is a nice looking unit. THE BAD: The power cord is much shorter than the previous model, which is a problem. The remote is flimsy, cheap, doesn't work that well and is really difficult to open. Once you do open it, you will find it needs one of those round, Quarter size batteries (which, of course, is not included). This model doesn't beep when the water level is getting low. There is no warning system. You have to unscrew the back of the unit in order to clean the filter. With the previous model you could just slide the filter out to clean it.",3
"It cools, but noisy when compressor running, no noise insulation at all, vibration cause plastic housing more noise. window seal kit has uneven height, need extra thick rubber tapes to help sealing air gaps.",3
"large, loud, more like a big expensive fan, only cools if standing in front of it, my apartment is 700 sq feet and it does not cool to the level I would hope for, also it increases humidity which leads to mugginess and further sweating in heat, returning",3
Be aware this unit ships only with a US plug and you will require a converter if you want to use it in the UK. This information is not supplied by the seller.,3
Not sure why the funnel keeps disconnecting from the unit. Highly annoying. It's loud but cools the area well.,3
"Normally I'm pretty satisfied with my OtterBox purchases, but this one was a bit disappointing. Because the glitter case is clear, it's not made of a hard plastic like the others. For some reason I thought it would be a little harder but it's a flexible plastic. Also, as a side note, don't be dumb like me and use acetone or nail polish remover around this. I melted the side of it within the first couple of days of having it.",4
Love this kit as it is cheap but feels solid. It is easy to use and is nice and sharp out the box.,4
"So far so good. Very easy to install, easy cleaning, super smooth operation and great water flow.",4
"This is a pretty sturdy, safe alternative to the traditional mandolin (though still use caution). Has several functions that all work decently for the cost. Good for a college student like I was - just starting out and wanting food simply chopped (not pretty). Bought it a while ago and kept it for about two years.It can have trouble cutting through tough veggies like potatoes and onions, so I needed to cut them in halves or quarters to cut them. Food gets very easily stuck, and is very difficult to clean out in the sink. Not sure if it’s dishwasher friendly, as I don’t have one.",4
"I love the nesting feature, but I am constantly worried about using a very high temperature while cooking. According to the instructions it strongly suggests to use a medium flame. Also, there is a weird grayish residue between washes on the bottom exterior of the pans. I think other than scratching each other that’s the reason for the felt dividers that came with the set. I feel like it should have one more large pot lid added so you can use multiple pots simultaneously. The cold storage lids don’t snap on, so they don’t feel secure when storing food in the fridge. Easy to clean both by hand and in a dishwasher.",4
"These have heavy enough bottom to not warp when cooking at medium-high heat. Come out clean from the dishwasher. As long as you don't dunk them in cold water when they are hot, these will stay good for a while.They are good for making omelets and sunny side up eggs; or even fried potatoes for a small family. Big enough well for deglazing and reduction of sauces, but obviously you don't want to make a bechamel sauce in these pans.",4
"I have a go-to set of mixing bowls that I love. But sometimes, especially during holidays and large cooking get togethers, I want to use a different set so I am not forced to wash and dry my set of 4 so often. So, in preparation for a large gathering weekend, I bought this set. I used many of the bowls and lids for the mass cooking adventure. I was pleased with the sizes and appearance of the bowls. I was able to use them for serving some dishes too. The lids worked well. I did not use the shredding feature so I cannot comment on that.I will note that the bowls are not thick or very sturdy. I hand washed all pieces so that they would not be warped. I saw in other comments that the kids warped over time. By hand washing, I suspect that won’t happen to mine. They are not thick, I emphasize. I do not plan to use these as my sturdy, everyday pieces but they will serve well as my secondary set. The metal is shiny but I suspect it will dull and scratch over time but that is just aesthetics. I love the bottoms as they do not move when mixing. For the money, this is a great set of bowls. I would not use them daily but I recommend them for back up prep and storing.",4
Nice sharp sturdy knife! Damascus pattern is not as visible in person,4
"Talk about being duped, read everything about this knife and was convinced it was made in Japan & sold in America, but alas, yes, sold in America but ""MADE IN CHINA"". I'm really getting sick & tired of this crap, AMAZON you need to lift your game & demand that these sellers display where the item is made!!!!!!! When I find an item that I'm tempted to buy it is the first thing I look for ""where it's made"" & if it's made in China then that's a NO GO for me because I've had to much CRAP from them & the quality is disgraceful, so if an item cannot display where it's made then I'll just move along or go without.",4

"Scissors are nice quality and do well cutting but have limited use due to difficulty of cleaning. These have limited applications because they don’t come apart for thorough cleaning. Any raw meat packaging or uncooked items that can easily transmit bacteria should be avoided as the bacteria can get trapped where shears are joined. Soaking or dishwasher cleaning ultimately results in rust as water cannot be totally dried. Because of this , they’re not truly all purpose and I will need to invest in another pair that can come apart.",4
they work great and are solid! sometimes they come defective where the red string is glued and it ripps the bags.,4
I wanted one with a stand to set up when entertaining a large group for a grab and go beverage option. The height is below waist level. It is folding table height. It did the job.,4
"Easy to clean. Does a nice job air frying and baking. I haven’t used all the features yet but so far it’s worked great. The only issue is the toast feature, which really doesn’t do a good job but no toaster oven does anyway. I use a toaster instead. Nice product.",4
"This quilt is not very thick nor is the nap very thick. It definitely has a nap, but it is very low and doesn’t dramatically change color when you smooth it against the grain. The loden color I picked is dark enough to pair with my purple throw pillows as my other comforters are dark purple. Because it is not very thick, it lays flat and offers a clean look on the bed. The shams are simple without frilly edges, but I like the look. The quilt is very thin; it does not really feel as if it is filled with anything, but it has a lot of weight to it so that it is sufficient for winter use. The California King size has plenty of length and width to cover my bed and even the top of my bed skirt - please note this quilt does not come with a matching bed skirt - so it looks smooth and finished when the bed is made. I do wish this set came in a dark purple and not the lavender they offer as I’d get that color in a heartbeat as I prefer this thinner but still heavy style of bed covering. I also like that it is basically the same on both sides so that you can reverse it and it won’t look “wrong”. And the fact that it can be machine washed and dried makes it a good option for someone looking for a flatter, less puffy look for their bed. My only gripe is that it wrinkles a bit.",4
This velvet quilt is nice. It is a but thinner than I hoped but it is nice and soft. My husband likes that it is thin but I get much colder than him. It washed and dried well when I got it. I didn’t notice any issue with stitching on my set. I think it is a nice snuggly quilt especially for those with texture sensitivities.,4
"Smells good, lasts a long time, calming.",4
Didn’t think I would like these as much as I do but they’re really nice and bright. Bright enough where I can sit in the office comfortably at night without the need of turning on the room lights. These also help with out with eye strain too that I’ve noticed when using the computer for long periods of time.Getting them up and running was a breeze and it also works just as well with Alexa assistant. Plenty of preset color options to choose from or you can make your own through the Govee App.Only reason I docked a point is because the double sided adhesive strips provided with the panels are abysmal. They lasted for a day before they started falling off the wall one by one. Had to order some 3M mounting tape to get these to stick so fair warning there.Overall I’m pleased with these and many other Govee products. Way more affordable solution compared to the other alternatives. I’d definitely recommend these.,4
"The lights are really easy to install with the app guiding you, it get nice and bright and works well with google home. I just Wish the app interface was a bit more user friendly and accessible.",4
This Reed diffuser has pleasant scent. I like how it has a decorative flower pattern not just sticks. It can be put in any room and the entire room smells nice. It comes in a nice box so it’s even perfect to gift to friends or family.,4
"I recently purchased the Reed Diffuser Set (Starshine1), and I’m really enjoying the fresh, pleasant scent it adds to my home. The fragrance is light and uplifting, with a nice balance that isn’t overpowering — it creates a calming atmosphere whether in the living room, bedroom, or even the bathroom. It’s the perfect scent for daily use and definitely enhances the ambiance in any room.The design of the diffuser itself is lovely and fits well with my home decor. I also appreciate the rattan reeds, which are stylish and functional. The aromatherapy effect is subtle yet effective, making it perfect for spaces where you want a gentle, consistent fragrance without it being too strong.My only minor critique is that I wish the scent-drawing straws (the reeds) were a bit larger. I’ve noticed that the scent doesn’t seem to diffuse as strongly as I expected, and I think larger reeds would help draw the fragrance out more effectively and fill the room with a more noticeable aroma. That said, it still works well for a more subtle scent and is a great option if you prefer a lighter fragrance.Overall, this is a lovely diffuser set with a great fragrance, and it’s a perfect decorative gift as well. I just wish the reeds were slightly thicker for better scent diffusion. Still, I’m very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others looking for a nice, relaxing room scent.",4
"First off, they are much smaller than I thought they’d be. I’ve only used one, as I needed something to store my towels on in my bathroom. It’s easy enough to install but even following the instructions, it ended up lopsided. No one notices but me..but it bugs me. I don’t like how flimsy it feels. I wouldn’t trust it for anything heavy.",4
"Instructions were clear, and it was nice that it specified the size of drill bits needed. But with the included hardware there is quite a bit of vertical flex to the bracket once mounted as it comes with countersunk screws which the bracket wasn't made for. After finding one of my shelves in particular was too saggy, I bought new screws with wide flat heads (see picture) and they are much more secure.It would also be nice if there was an included way to secure the shelf on the bracket - it just slides on and off. I'm considering whether I want to glue it, or perhaps inset a neodymium magnet on the shelf back so it would hold to the bracket.",4
Love the design and the fact that it melts the candle without getting smokey or sutty. Much safer than an actual lit candle. Just be careful when handling once it's turned on. Keep out of reach of children and pets.,4
My only complaint is that the little basket for the toothbrushes is skinnier metal than the rest and it doesn't stay on the hooks as well. The rest of them are perfect and look really nice. They hold a lot more than what we have to put in them.,4
"These wooden art signs are each a different size. When you store them, they nest inside each other. They are meant to be displayed on a table-top. They do not have hooks on the back to hang, but there is room to add a narrow one if you wanted to. The graphics are simple, in red and blue on a white background, but perfect for baseball (especially if you have an All-Stars display!). The slogans are those that baseball fans all know and love and are pretty timeless. My son is on two baseball teams, so I display these on the sideboard in our foyer with his team photos during the season.",4
I have this wreath on the front door and it will work for the summer. I have other wreaths for the other seasons. I like the way it looks and am pleased with it. I have to agree with other reviewers that the bow is very flimsy. I haven’t changed it yet but will do so in the future. Other than that it’s a nice looking wreath at a good price.,4
I have placed this near a window and the light shines through beautifully.,4
Very cute but smaller than expected.,4
Awesome pc for gaming gets around 240-300 fps in fortnite and never freezes all of a sudden. I recommend as for a first pc-,4
Wireless charger and headset plug dosent work other than that great pc,4
I like the support team response to a small issue. The repair was swift and great workmanship. My son loves his gaming computer and the lights around the computer match his room decor.,4
"Bought this for my 10 year old son. It is fairly fast out of the box. Runs his current games (Minecraft, Roblox, etc..) with zero issues. Looking forward to him getting into more robust games in the future so I can teach him how to upgrade his computer. This gives us a solid base that fits all his current needs and also allows us to build as we go. Big bonus is the looks. He absolutely loves the looks of this machine (little too flashy for my taste).",4
"it’s definitely worth the buy for the money. I’ve been playing on it for about an hour and have had no lag when it comes to opening things downloading things or even watching videos. The only thing that it can’t do (which is why i gave it 4 stars) and if you’re looking for this don’t buy, but it does not record gaming videos very well, which is what I wanted when I originally purchased, but I’m still happy with the product because it runs most of my games very well.",4
"The pc is good, third gen I5 performs better than expected even tho ddr3 ram starts to show its age, its still reliable. I only added a low profile card, The GTX 1050Ti from Zotac. It can run GTA Online between 50 to 75 fps (I cant see more beacause of the 75hz monitor), Fortnite runs perfectly on Performance mode, high settings, expect a few stutters for the few first games. For the E-sports titles such as Valorant and CSGO you'll have no problem running them. Its a pretty good computer for the price to performance ratio. I bought my gtx1050ti from Facebook Marketplace for 65 CAD$. BTW, I bought a different mouse with side buttons from Walmart for $6",4
"My previous desk only accommodated laptop. I was gifted a PC and needed to find something bigger but simple, as I had limited space. This fit that description perfectly. It's sturdy, sleek and affordable. My favorite perk is the built in power connections that allow USB and prongs. The lights are great and I like to match then with my keyboard. Very happy with this buy.",4
"Easy to build, took me about an hour total, instructions are very easy to follow. The desk itself is pretty sturdy, and holds all of my gaming setup no problem, with a good amount of arm room.I would’ve liked the desk to to be one single board instead of 3 smaller ones you combine to make the desk. Also the shelf to hold my computer is a tad bit small, with about an inch of my computer not being supported by the shelf it’s supposed to sit on, but I don’t think it will fall off unless it is kicked or bumped hard.The LED lights do not come with a sticky back, and the ones provided aren’t very good. So I’d recommend going and buying some double sided tape beforehand!Otherwise I am very happy with the product and the outcome! Great value for its price point.",4
"Bought this mic strictly because I was in need of a mic, mic arm stand etc. But what's even better is that some of my friends have the more expensive microphones like blue yeti and the 100-200 dollar mics for podcasts/recording music etc. and this one is right there with them I feel like. Maybe i'll notice more fractional differences down the road but as a overall mic, its great.The voice quality is very clear, it sounds crisp, no cutting out, no distortion, just a smooth voice with very little background noise. I use it for gaming, talking with friends on discord, even recording some vocals to see what my voice can really do lol. I guess I'm a singer now! It actually sounds better than I thought.It has soft touch buttons to turn volume of the mic up and down, holding it mutes. It just feels like such a satisfying touch.The design is clean, its the same size all around basically, doesn't feel outdated, too big and cheap, it feels like $100+ mic made with good durable parts and nice edges. Love the basically all black design.Overall, like I was saying, now that I have the mic, I would have just paid that much for the mic itself but since I was in need of the mic arm stand mostly, I went with this. Also though, I got a shock mount which actually is nice for not hearing any noise from things touching my desk, etc. I didn't know the value of this until I tried with and without it. The mic arm stand is nice, does exactly what it needs to do, use to have a super cheap 10 dollar one and it just wouldn't move smooth and this one just feels like a crane and its nice.Definitly will buy again, going to pick another one up soon for my girlfriend, built her a computer recently as well and it will be a good combo to have.",4
It's a Christmas gift for my daughter so it hasn't been opened but the pricing and shipping were great,4
"Shipment was delayed supposed to come in on sunday came on Thursday. Did come in thought UPS not amazon. At first of putting in power cord and HDMI cord ( HDMI cord did work) it would not turn on, but after inserting and plugging the power cord of the xbox off and on several times it did eventually work and then turned on. When it turned on it did restart itself twice but after worked completely normal. After all that no issues came from the xbox. Games like college football and Jedi Survivor has worked smoothly and download speed runs fast. Actually would recommend especially during prime day. A Xbox S 1TB was 350 no shipping while this on prime day in 2024 was 400 with shipping so definitely worth but can be risky with all the other reviews in place. Risk it though because this is way more worth it.",4
"If you want the new gen Xbox’s but can’t get the X, this is for you.",4
"The media could not be loaded. I bought this as a surprise for my son, as I was redoing his media room. Not only is it aesthetically pleasing, but super multifunctional. He can charge many things on this device. We love the lights on it. You can keep it one solid color. You can change it to a rotation of the colors too if you like. This has been great for minimizing cords and chargers and cables. Also, it keeps my son from just tossing his headphones down in a chair. This actually helps them last longer.",4
"Well, I wasn't planning on getting an 8th gen console. I was really in the state of thought, that it wouldn't be much of an upgrade from 7th gen to 8th, like it was jumping from 6th gen to 7th, or 5th gen to 6th. But. I had to reconsider since there where games coming out for the 8th gen consoles I really wanted, so I went on ahead and pulled the trigger. You only live once, amiright? My opinion about the leap from 7th gen to 8th is not that huge, is still the same. It really isn't that much of an upgrade. Just the likes of Xbox One and PS4 has smoother textures and graphics, and can handle more AI and activity than their predecessors. But hey, we're reaching the climax of how much we can do with this technology so it's a given.Now, that I have my views of 8th generation out the way, lemme get to the main course. The Xbox One.I enjoy it. I'm still trying to work around it and get to know it. Know the little new features that is. It's kind of like a 360, but with more. More downloading than the 360 as well. Just to play a DVD, I had to download an app just to make it work. I know. It isn't about watching movies, it's about the gaming. But still. Since previous systems just let you pop in the disk and play your movies, without having to worry installing features is kind of the point. Pop movie in Xbox. Movie plays. Pop movie into 360, movie play. Pop movie into Xbox One. Opps! You've gotta download an app for that! I know it's free. I know it's quick. But it's still stupid. Apps also have a knack for freezing sometimes. Like the youtube app. I'll be in the middle of watching a video, and it freezes. And I can't shut the tab down. The only thing left to do is to shut down the console and turn it back on. Scrolling threw the dashboard has a bit of a lag to it vs the 360. Maybe do to more plastered content? I don't know. I know. Stupid thing to nitpick about. Grain of salt people. But I'm sure these things won't matter with a few more patches and updates.Now that I've got the kinks out the way. Lemme get to the meaty part. The gaming experience. I haven't put too much playtime into it. But so fair, I say it's fun factor is very good. I had a good time playing Forza 6. More games are on the way so I can give this system some more playtime and open it up. This is going to be short since I just the console a few days ago and I need to get more in depth. But so far. No problems with the gaming aspect. Kind of funny thinking back in 2013, people where saying the Xbox One wasn't ""for the gamers"". It most certainly is.physical durability.Unlike last generation, within I year I would start hearing horror stories of reliability issues with the consoles of old. 2 years has already passed since these consoles had been out, I haven't heard any REALLY bad problems with these consoles yet. A few PS4's and Xbox One's bricked at launch, but only a slim few. The rest of time was smooth sailing for these consoles. Sure. The Xbox One isn't the prettiest looking thing in the world, but certainly isn't the ugliest. Like the original Xbox, this thing was built to last. There are huge vents everywhere. From the top to the sides, so no worries about overheating from hours of gameplay. Plus, the thing is really quiet. It doesn't make a peep. Unlike the old Xbox's, the One is so quiet you could hear a fly fart. The 360's fan roars more than Mufasa from The Lion King. I love how I can finally have some peace and quiet, when I have a console on. That's a welcomed change. Controller is not that shabby either. Although the 360 controller will always be my personal favorite. The 360 controller feels better than the One's by leaps and bounds. But when not compared to the 360 controller, the One's controller is really comfy and fitting. No huge complaints there.The verdict.I've only had the Xbox One for a few days, and I'm already loving it. It's not perfect. But it's not horrible like some people want you to believe either. (I'm looking at you PS4 fanboys.) The Xbox One is a fine investment that will give its owner hours of fun playtime for casual and hardcore gamers alike. Don't be expecting huge graphical leaps with these consoles. But don't think it's under powered either. The Xbox One certainly has redeemed itself, after it's horror show of a launch two years ago. So many people expected it to fail, but here we are. People are warming up to it and nodding in respect for Microsoft and the Xbox One turning around for the better.4/5",4
"I've been obsessed with it since it arrived. The seemless user interface and sleek design is absolutely captivating. From 10 percent, the phone will take 4 hours to charge if you have a regular adapter. It will hold a charge for a great amount of time. Pairs very well with Echo Buds, which I also highly recommend for audiophiles who look for balance between their music and their surroundings. The phone does come alone, without the promo for the $100 gift card, so double check your cart to make sure you chose the correct option.Update on having the phone for two months:This one of the best phones out there! The functionality is superb. However, it can heat up when fast charging and when using a couple of high functioning apps at a time. Fast charge take an hour and a half. The phone does not slow down, but the heat makes the phone a little uncomfortable to hold after, even with a case.",4
"I got this smartphone as an alternative to a.) Getting my iPhone 12 pro scrubbed.b.) buying another iPhone.To explain, I got hacked while using my iPhone and my bank wanted me to get it scrubbed in case there was some sort of malware on it. So rather than driving 40 minutes and paying $190 to get that done along with the paperwork certifying it was done, I just bought a brand new Samsung A-15 from Amazon. It performs well and satisfied my bank. Price is probably the .ain't factor in my purchasing this phone. I think I owned a Galaxy S-21 before, and I like this A-15 better. It has no water resistance, one speaker, but it has decent cameras and is fast enough loading internet sites. It's a tad big and heavy, but the + side is a larger screen. There is no inductive charging, but it uses a 25 watt charger that makes charging relatively fast. Also, the battery lasts a long time. I think it's 5000 miliamps. I've had it last over 3 days, so that's a plus. If you are an iOS user and have Apple Mail, that can be challenging, but once you set everything up, it's no big deal.",4
"I received this yesterday and have tried it out for nearly 24 hours now. I will be using this as a back up phone.The pluses.Nice big clear and bright screen.I like the case and the color. It looks and feel quite decent,Good, responsive touchscreen with good colors.Good wifi and bluetooth. On screen keyboard is also easy to use.Large battery, I charged it to 100 % last night and its still at 70%Good sound quality and fairly loud speakers.Negatives.There is some lag but that is in comparison to my “high end” main phone but I consider it to be more than acceptable.The cameras have great colors are appear to be over processed.If this was for use as my main shooter, it would not be acceptable but for the bargain price, and considering that this is budget phone, both front and rear cameras will suffice.Not too keen on the side finger print reader, it does work and actually responds quite fast, I don’t care for the location.So as a budget back up phone, there are some negatives but I can live with them all.Not; the first two photos were taken with the rear came at high resolution. The third was taken with the front facing camera. The last two were taken indoors in a restaurant setting on high resolution.I quite like this phone. I had been considering a 5 year old phone for a back up…. It still had really good specs but I was concerned about the battery and how much longer it would work. Also there would not be any security updates on an older phone but this is from 2024 and has already done several updates since I first powered it on, and it is due to be upgraded to Android 14 later this summer. ( I mention this because there are surely other folks looking for a budget back up phone.)Also, since I don’t play any games, I cant offer any opinions in that respect.For a back up phone, its ideal and I recommend it!",4
A budget phones serves all your needs for a second phone. Bit slow.,4
"Except the provided wireless controller. The left control stick was not functioning correctly and the controller would shut off on it's own.No problem as i had perfectly functioning controllers on hand.The important part was the console itself which happened to function perfectly. No issues or hiccups. I can now enjoy my 360 games again as my old console has been dead for several months,...though it provided over 11 years of service....i hope this renewed unit can provide the same.",4
A liked it but was a little on the small side and only red color.,4
"3D best in a dark room, less dark equals less crisp design. Best to have at eye level or looking at it straight on, when deciding where to place.",4
My grandson loved this.,4
Definetly works but you have to apply so much and one coffee and your back to stained teeth,4
Definetly works but you have to apply so much and one coffee and your back to stained teeth,4
It lightens my teeth a shade after several uses. However when I skip any days using it my teeth go back to their normal coloring.,4
As expected,4
"I have been using this for a few weeks now, and have not seen any significant results. I do realize that there are a lot of variables, and people have different diets, different brushing rituals, etc. So maybe others will see more significant results. The taste is not bad in my opinion (slight mint flavor). I would personally not buy this at the current price point due to the lack of results for me.",4
"I wanted to try this toothpaste as I do not want to spend a fortune on tooth whitening, and because I wanted to try a milder version of the dark charcoal toothpastes that have been around for a bit of time now but shouldn’t be used everyday because they have the potential to damage the enamel.The toothpaste comes in a simple tube with a screw cap and an initially sealed opening. The expiration date is on the box it comes in and is well into 2026, so no worries about taking a bit of time to use this paste.Expressing the toothpaste is almost too easy as the toothpaste seems thinner consistency-wise than other toothpastes. It seems to do a good job cleaning teeth, and although I wouldn’t say it has a pleasant taste, it is also not a bad taste.Rinsing it with just a bit of water by swishing it around gets rid of the paste quickly and I must say I am surprised that all the grittiness from the paste washes out just like that. I am not sure about the whitening effect yet, but my teeth feel clean and my mouth refreshed after each use.",4
"We loved this when we first got it. Our kid has a hard time opening toothpaste caps but this made toothbrushing easier and fun for our 6 yr old. But after some uses, it gets clogged since there’s no way to actually get all the toothpaste out unless you remove and rinse it every time.",4
Tastes great. It will get stuck in the tube. Not happy about that!,4
"way too expensive for absolutely no reason, but it is the only one our toddler wants to use so....",4
"No he doesn't want to use any of the more mundane and boring easily gotten mint toothpastes, so here we have a winner! Fantastic packaging, swift delivery and great taste. This could be the difference for my 10 yr old having teeth or not by the time his 15! very happy.",4
"Right after I use it, I notice a difference, but not sure it lasts. I’m not unhappy with it… I just can’t tell if I love it. It’s a cheaper alternative to other products.",4
Really works for a quick teeth brightening! I use before a night out and it does a good job for a quick touch up. Doesn’t really have a taste.,4
"This is my second jar. The taste is something to get use to. The essential oils do not cover the taste. You have to get use to baking soda. The perks, it’s great for sensitivity. Clove is wonderful. No foam, hard to brush that way but you adjust.",4
"I'm not a cheap person. And though this stuff works great, I'll be looking elsewhere for a cheaper, but comprable quality.",4
"Some of the tablets have partially disintegrated in the jar or broken into bits which is unfortunate, but the ones that are whole work well, very strong minty flavors. When you chew the toothpaste up only chew like 2-3 times the toothbrush will do the rest for you. It's definitely different to get used to but it works.",4
"I wanted to like these. I didn't mind them. They suds nice. I just felt like they fell short. I would consider buying them again, but at the moment I am shopping around. They do clean your teeth, are better for the environment that tubes, and they're great for traveling.",4
"This product is well-made and has excellent form, but the function was off for me. That being said, the product description is accurate; it's an ear irrigation flushing system, nothing more, nothing less. The tip disperses three streams of water that quickly empty the water cup into your ear canal. For me, at least, the process was not messy as the exiting water fell into the sink and not on my clothing. There are two buttons on the machine; get familiar with their function and positions if you're operating the machine by yourself. Otherwise, you might accidentally increase the pressure or prematurely start the machine, spraying water all over your bathroom.Now, back to the function: I was expecting something more, like pulsating or spiral streams of water. I believe I have clean ears, and I did not see any earwax removed after using the machine. After using the machine, I was able to extract earwax manually with an ear canal scraping wand. I don't think water alone would remove this ordinary earwax unless it came into direct contact with a pressurized water stream. Since there are only three fixed streams, only three spots on the outer ear canal are directly exposed to the full stream cleaning effect; the rest of the ear is exposed only to a water flush. If you are the in the market for ear flush irrigation machine this is the product for you.",4
"This ear irrigation system is compact and portable enough to take with you on vacation. The water chamber is emptied out the spout in 3 streams of water that do not rotate, pulse, or in any way agitate the earwax. The water gets warm, but not really hot enough or strong enough to dislodge stubborn wax. But this is probably a good thing because if it was too strong or directed into the ear drum it might cause damage and we wouldn't want that. It is good enough to help warm and loosen the wax so you can get it out with a scraper or to help assist the stubborn wax to come out of your ear when you can't get it with an ear scraper. My son had a heavy wax build up when he was small and the irrigation system the doctor used was huge in comparison to this item. If I would have had this back then the process would have been so much easier. But just remember to take it for what it is, an ear irrigation system. It just heats up and pushes water into your ear. It isn't a jet stream or a power washer.",4
"Doctors were flushing my ears once a year, because of a family bend in the ear canal. Still not perfect but helps and is easy to use.",4
"They work like advertised. Its bristles are about as stiff as a hard bristled toothbrush. The different sized heads are useful as well. The smallest head was especially useful for corners. The only reason I didn't give this a five star is because I really couldn't use it with the Pink Stuff. The bristles or motor just wasn't strong enough to cut through the pink paste. It works great with Ajax or Comet, just not the Pink Stuff. (I love the Pink Stuff btw.)",4
I love the ear wax removal micro camera for getting the places and seeing what's built up in the ear. I have had really itchy ears so this is great to get in and help clean out the itchy areas without causing harm or losing the tip of a cotton swab. I love the accessory tools that come with this for extra cleaning ability.,4
"This Ear Wax Removal Tool Camera is great to have as getting the inner ear visual is super cool and it includes different tools to remove the wax. However, this is an easy way for people wanting to dig deeper and deeper into the ear, which can cause a lot of harm to the eardrum -- leave that to a professional. It's neat to own and, for other purposes, great to have a micro camera.",4
"My opinion is that this steam cleaner is perfect for anyone who is looking for a method of cleaning their house that does not involve the use of chemicals, particularly for removing tough filth and grime. The fact that it comes with a variety of attachments is a significant advantage since it enables the cleaner to be adaptable enough to deal with a variety of surfaces and chores. The fact that this steam cleaner is both lightweight and small is one of the things that I particularly like about it. I believe that the mobility of this product is a significant benefit, particularly when it comes to cleaning areas such as restrooms or even the inside of your vehicle. It is simple to transport from one room to another. The deep gray color gives it a sleek appearance, and the ergonomic handle makes it easy to use for extended periods of time, which is ideal for cleaning applications. I am grateful that it warms up in a relatively short amount of time; it requires just a few minutes to get ready for use, and I did not get the impression that I was waiting around to get started. The set consists of twelve components, which include nozzles, a brush, and attachments that are designed for a variety of surfaces. The results of using the little brush to clean the grout in my bathroom were extremely impressive, and I am quite pleased with the outcomes. Because of the pressured steam, I was able to remove the filth that I had previously battled to remove with more conventional ways in a short amount of time. I believe that the steam is strong enough to remove debris that has been adhered to surfaces without the need for an excessive amount of physical effort, and I believe that it makes cleaning more effective in general.",4
"Works very good in getting down in the vent area. Was surprised at how much lint it cleaned out, which is comforting as I don't want a dryer fire.",4
These are long which works well. I use one for cleaning the dryer vent. I’ve cleaned it from inside the machine & from the outside vent. I use the other for cleaning out from under the fridge & the oven. The only negative for these is that they are difficult to clean all the lint & gunk off of the bristles.,4
"The Holikme 2 Pack Dryer Vent Cleaner Kit is a game-changer for anyone looking to improve the performance of their cloth dryer and safeguard their home against potential fire hazards. This versatile kit includes two essential tools: a dryer lint brush and a long, flexible refrigerator coil brush, providing you with everything you need to keep your appliances running smoothly and your home safe. With a quantity of 2 pieces in each pack, this kit offers exceptional value for money, ensuring that you always have a spare on hand when needed. It's worth noting the manufacturer's advice to wear gloves while using the product to ensure optimal hand protection—a thoughtful addition to the user's safety. The primary purpose of this kit is to improve the working performance of cloth dryers by effectively cleaning trapped lint and dust in dryer gaps and exhaust ports. By doing so, it not only enhances dryer efficiency but also reduces the risk of fire hazards in your home—a critical consideration for maintaining a safe living environment. But the benefits don't stop there. This versatile kit can also be used to clean dust and pet hair under furniture and appliances, making it a valuable tool for overall household cleanliness and maintenance.",4
"I love that this bends at different angles and that you can use it as a short handle or long one. The quality is great and it is very sturdy. It doesn’t bog down at all while you’re using it trying to get grime out of corners but I feel like the bristles could have been better. After one time of use, the bristles were pretty bent up and some were coming out of the brush. It is pretty powerful and lightweight. It’s a great value for what what you pay for it. There are multiple speeds but I feel like the highest speed works the best. It definitely gets grime off of things without having to hand scrub them but if you have a tough job, it won’t work well.",4
"This item gets a 4 because it is a great concept, long pole with a head that shifts so you can clean baseboards and a reusable head that you can remove and clean. Well, someone can remove and clean, not me. The cloth is really stuck on there. The plastic head is very flimsy and unscrews itself from the pole as you use it. I had to stop and screw the head back in three times while cleaning the baseboards.That said, the baseboard cleaner does a great job on a difficult task. The head could be more study and the cleaning cloth easier to remove, but the concept is a winner.",4
"It is handy to do baseboards with but flimsy pole, lean too much on it and would break.",4
"This gizmo does save one from bending to clean the baseboards. I do have a complaint though. The cleaning pad is really difficult to remove from the unit as the Velcro is incredibly strong which makes it difficult for arthritic hands. Secondly, even though I squeezed the water out of the pad before attaching it to the pole, I found that, when applying pressure to the baseboards to clean them, water dripped out of the pad necessitating having to get down to wipe up the wet. The cleaning pad is made out of some unusual fabric and it does not want to hold the water you put on it.",4
Seems to actually work. Not painful. Easy to use. Would buy again.,4
"Smells like chemicals sorta, not super intense and it’s gone once it dries but still, not what I would expect. It does peel really well and my skin does feel great.",4
"First of all, I want to say that these are EXTREMELY cool. I have never seen anything like this and for someone who will lay in bed to binge watch an entire series on Netflix, these are super nifty for avoiding any kinks in your neck. I actually thought it was a fluke because there is no way you could watch a show clearly with something like this, but IT IS LEGIT. The image is a bit smaller though.Cons:- Heavy -- considering these are to be worn like glasses, they are relatively heavy and can be super uncomfortable if worn for too long, so it's not ideal for long-term use.- Vision impairment? I am not sure how to explain it, but since you're technically staring at a reflection, it kind of messes with your eyes, in my opinion. I am not sure how it is when reading, but if you wear them while watching tv, then it almost feels like you're going cross eyed. Again, only happens if you wear them for too long. I've actually used them before bed if I couldn't fall asleep because it almost makes your eyes feel droopy and tired...Overall, it's super inventive and a really unique product, and despite the cons, I would still recommend it considering how inexpensive it is! But if you are prone to getting headaches, I wouldn't buy it.",4
Great buy for the price will buy again.,4
"These glasses are really pretty slick. De to the multi-focal lenses, I can wear them with or without my contacts, so I don't have to have different glasses (yes, my contacts do not completely fix my reading...)They don't sit quite right on the nose, so they do leave a mark when you wear them for any length of time. And they are NOT fashionable! They do, however, work great, and the price is very reasonable. Definitely recommend.",4
"For the price, these glasses are a steal. The materials feel high-quality and the craftsmanship is excellent!So far So good!",4
A good value but not very sturdy s little more fragile than expected. But great price so are more disposable,4
"The instructions specifically said not to walk around with them on, but the kids couldn't resist. They're a bit heavy on your nose but they did really help with neck fatigue while crocheting for long periods.",4
"This review is for: Virtegasas Horizontal Lazy Glasses Bed Prism Spectacles Lazy Readers Glasses Periscope Eyeglasses Upgraded Prism Glasses - For Reading and Watching TV in Bed While Lying FlatGot these yesterday. Pretty wild! They really do work. I have to say that it's pretty wild how your vision is separated through these two tunnels and your eyes still put the two images together, perfectly, like it's one image. Just a fun anatomy thing, I guess.I tried them two ways, close up and more of a distance. Laid flat in bed and looked at my phone. Vivid and crystal clear, just as if you were looking directly at your phone. While you can see a little but of something down the center of your vision in a way, it doesn't interfere with the object you're looking at and you can still see it clearly.Then, while still laying flat in bed, I tried watching TV. My TV is on a wall that is probably about 13 feet or so from my eyes. Still, the image was clear and I could see it perfectly.The only reason for 4 stars is that in both cases, the image is smaller and seems farther away than it is. I think this is just the physics involved with the image being reflected and there is probably no avoiding it. It's not too bad, but it is very obvious that the image you're looking at is smaller and farther away, seemingly. Maybe it's not fair to dock the product if this illusion is unavoidable, but 5 stars on these might convey that they reflect the image just as if it would be if you were looking at it directly, but it does not.Price is very reasonable at (currently) $13.99.I feel that these could be extremely useful in certain circumstances where mobility is an issue! If someone had neck troubles, etc., this would be a great solution.If I could give these 4.2 or 4.5, I would.I hope this was helpful.",4
"I love these and definitely recommend to anyone and everyone! Kind of heavy on the bridge of my nose and on my ears, but I'm not used to wearing glasses regularly so that is probably the cause.",4
"These bifocals stickers are good quality, rigid material, not flimsy and work great.......once you get them to adhere to your glasses. I ordered 2 sets and three of the stickers adhered fairly easily but the fourth one would not stay stuck. I had to reapply several times, which was easy to do, and the top edge of the sticker just will not stick. I finally decided it was as good as it was going to get and since I could still see thru the bifocal to read etc. I just quit trying to get it perfectly stuck. These are basically like putting a screen protector on your phone or tablet and have the same issues such as bubbles. There is also a definite right and wrong side to the sticker because they have a slight curve to them. If you have completely flat lenses on your glasses, not sure these would work. But once I got the stickers to adhere to my sunglasses they worked fine and I am happy with my purchase.",4
"They’re al little cheaply made, but perfect for what I wanted and the price. I use them all of the time. There are some blind spots and my glasses have fogged up, but I do recommend them!",4
"I bought these 2.5 diopter flip glasses for doing electronics work. I was tired of having to search my messy work area to find the other pair of glasses when I needed to change between reading my computer screen and being able to see what I was working on. That meant switching between some 1.5 glasses and and my 4.0. Since my search skills are horrible (I swear I can't find my own feet), this ate up a lot of time and patience.I love these! They are convenient and clear. They are easy to put on my drug store reading glasses. They work just like having two different pairs, without the searching pain.Yes, they are a little heavy. What would you expect. They don't have an anti-gravity mechanism to make them weightless. I had to tighten up the ear pieces on my 1.75's so the assembled pair wouldn't slide down my nose. But, they're not so heavy that they are uncomfortable.I need to get my wife her own pair for her beading work.",4
"I bought these lenses in January 2018. It is now August 2018 & I need to replace them. So I got about 7 months of HEAVY use for just under $13 -- not bad at all, but not quite great.The glasses are reasonably scratch resistant. Fairly light in weight so... comfortable to use. I flip them up & down a lot -- down for reading, up for conversations & other activities. The spring holding the lens when flipped up is still working just fine. However, the spring that holds the lens in place when it is flipped down, so as to be against my glasses for reading purposes -- that spring has lost some power. As a result, the lenses ""sag"" away from my glasses, just a quarter inch or so, when I tilt my head to read or do cloose work. It's a minor annoyance but spoils my concentration at times. So I just bought a replacent pair of lenses.The lenses themselves are great. Flip lenses are a good idea for people who, like me, make frequent shifts between close work & other activities. With lighter use these lenses would surely last longer. Even so... 7 months of heavy use for under $13 -- I can live with that.Aloha to all from Hawaii.",4
I do wear these all the time. I like that they have a pair of sunglasses too because I am always reading outside.I can use them only in my home for the 'one power' like looking up at the TV from my computer or book. It does not work when I'm driving at all.,4
"These are built pretty well. Not sure how they work. They do not seem to adjust from low to high, but I can wear them all day or just to read, and all is in focus. A mystery! Still a huge value here.",4
"These have lasted the longest Ive ever had a pair...going on 3 years hanging on my shirt collar every day. a little pricey, but you get what you pay for.",4
"The glasses fit great and work well for my intended purposes. The only problem I had was that the left temple was bent and almost broken. I was able to fix this without breaking the temple. The packaging was a ziploc bag inside an envelope, with no real protection against being crushed.",4
Fit well and and are as described. Non- Bi-focal readers that allow for ease of use.,4
I love this case! I had recently cracked the entire back of my phone due to having a non- protective case on it. I ordered this otter box because it’s cute but also provides protection. It fits my phone perfectly and is very comfortable to hold. It has protected the camera in the back and is very durable - I don’t even have a scratch on it yet!,5
"I’ve been through a few phone cases for my iPhone 14 Pro Max and haven’t found one that fits it well (particularly around the rear facing camera)…until now! I don’t understand how so many different cases don’t fit something as popular as an iPhone (especially in the exact same place and way). The magnet is the right amount of strength too, not at all weak so holds on to my car mount, but easy to remove if you are intentionally trying to remove it from a mount or charger.",5
"I love this phone case. It’s not bulk or slippery and I love the shimmer. I also use a metal magnetic mag safe pop socket and it sticks amazingly. I’ve dropped my phone several times with this case on and it protects it. Otter box is great! I just bought a new one to replace my old one, which was about a year and a half old. They last a long time but it will yellow over time. I recommend replacing once a year to keep it looking clear and pretty.",5

"The ASUS ROG Strix G16 is an absolute powerhouse and a dream machine for gamers and creators alike.Equipped with top-tier hardware, this laptop handles everything I throw at it effortlessly. Gaming is buttery smooth even with maxed-out settings, and multitasking is seamless thanks to the powerful processor and ample RAM.The 16-inch screen with its high refresh rate is stunning. The colors are vibrant, the details are sharp, and the fluidity makes fast-paced games feel immersive and responsive.Sleek, modern, and undeniably ROG. The RGB keyboard is customizable and adds a premium feel, while the cooling system is highly effective and keeps the laptop running optimally even during long sessions.For a gaming laptop, the Strix G16 strikes a great balance between performance and portability. It’s lightweight enough to carry around without sacrificing the power you’d expect from a desktop replacement.While gaming laptops are known for short battery lives, the G16 pleasantly surprised me with its efficiency during non-gaming tasks.For the specs and performance this machine offers, it’s worth every penny. It’s an investment that will serve well for years to come.Whether you’re gaming, streaming, or editing, the ASUS ROG Strix G16 is a beast. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a reliable, high-performance laptop!",5

"I wanted to buy another laptop for work purposes but also be useful for travelling and for gaming so I saw this laptop for sale during Black Friday! Excellent purchase! Here is my pros and cons after a week of owning this:Con:1. 1920 x 1200 FHD 165Hz Display is very much an downgrade against my Legion 5 Pro 16"" 2560 x 1600 IPS LCD 165Hz Display... But I guess with the parts offered, ASUS had to make some budget cuts somewhere I guess... (for the model I've chosen and not wanting to spend more than $1500 USD).2. Automatic MUX Switching is annoying... it optimizes which option to best suit for your current usage at the time (e.g. if you ran an game vs closing the game and brings you to the desktop). The automatic switch seems like its great and all but it ruins the display setting and when an game is playing, it switches again and sends you back to the desktop and ruins the display setting/resolution once more... Its best to just set it on the dedicated GPU option so you dont have to deal with this...3. Standard SSD Capacity is too low (again with cost saving measures but literally everyone these days just buy additional SSD stick anyways)... so snagged an SK.Hynix P41 SSD 2TB stick on sale to manually install for loading heavy application and games on there; really easy to install and easy to unscrew the back; there is an empty NVMe Gen4 M.2 2280 slot for you to install your SSDWorks Great after installing correctly and no Issues now! (make sure after install of SSD, just load into Windows and open up disk management to reformat (quick format! never full on SSD!) No need to tinker with BIOS setting...Do not tighten the SSD screws too much where the stick bends! thats incorrect! screw in ever so slightly so that the stick itself wont lodge out or move at all.Pros:1. RTX 4060 8GB - 140W Max TGP2. i7-13650HX - beats my Ryzen-7 5800H on my Legion 5 Pro3. RGB bar looks awesome!4. Battery 90WhNeutral:1. RGB Keys - heard mixed reviews on ASUS's design on this; of course, the Legion 5 RGB keyboard design is the best of the best but this is just okay and its not too bad in my eyes.2. Same weight and nearly the same dimensions as my Legion 5 Pro so portability is the same-ish but way better than my old MSI gaming laptop from 2017 where you can put this in your backpack and still have room to put other accessories and such.This is all I've noticed currently but either way, its a great mid-tier gaming laptop! I can run cyberpunk all max setting without issues or framerate drops and every other AAA game titles up to this point... This laptop should last an long time until AAA games becomes more graphically intense and requiring more processing power... but again this is the best you can get for your money and highly recommend!",5
I like that's nearly the quietest laptop compared to its competitors with same specs. also I'm impressedwith the GPU performance.maybe there's some coilwhine yeah but very minor to notice.overall I really like it!!,5
"The laptop performs well, with about 4 months of usage and it is still rock solid.",5
"I invested in the Amazon Basics Stainless Steel Comfort Grip Knife Set, and my kitchen experience has been nothing short of wonderful. This 18-piece set is a complete arsenal for all your culinary adventures. With each knife designed for a specific task, it's like having a professional kitchen right on your countertop.The first thing that caught my eye was the sleek design and the comfort grip handles. These knives not only look gorgeous on my kitchen counter, but the grip is so ergonomic that chopping has become a less tedious task. The brushed stainless steel handles offer a secure and comfortable grip, making the knives easy to control even during demanding tasks.The high carbon stainless steel blades are the stars of the show. They are stain, rust, and pit resistant, which is a testament to their durability. With a satin finish, they glide through ingredients with ease. The variety of knives in this set is impressive, catering to all kinds of food prep tasks like chopping, cutting, slicing, peeling, and much more.Now, while the knives are sharp and ready to use out of the box, I did notice that they might need frequent sharpening with heavy use. The good news is that the set includes a sharpening steel, so keeping the blades sharp and ready is not a chore.The rubber wood block that houses the knives is compact and stylish, fitting well in any kitchen setting. The set includes a chef's knife, bread knife, ham knife, santoku knife, utility knife, vegetable knife, paring knife, sharpening steel, and eight steak knives, all neatly organized in a rubber wood block.The affordability of this set is a cherry on top. It's a budget-friendly option without compromising on quality or functionality. The Amazon Basics Stainless Steel Comfort Grip Knife Set is indeed a valuable addition to any kitchen. The quality, the range of knives, and the price point make it a commendable choice. I highly recommend this set to anyone looking to upgrade their kitchen game without breaking the bank.",5
"I needed some knives for a horror movie I'm filming. I don't want people to die but I love making movies about it. I needed a block of knives that weren't good chef's knives but that we could use to film.They look GREAT on camera!!! Not the best for cooking if you're a chef but you already know that. They came sharp and even made the ""shink!"" sound when pulled out.If you actually care about good knives, get good knives. These are fine as a movie prop.",5
"I love the price of these. They're very basic, run-of-the-mill knives, but the product is well made. I needed a new set of knives on a budget (my old dull ones weren't very practical) and these showed up on my page. Very nice product for the price, allowed me to get a new set of knives on a budget",5
Great value for the money! You get alot of knives in this set and also many different types depending on the use you need. They are VERY sharp and cut beautifully,5
I am really happy with this knife set. The block is beautiful on its own and the knives are terrific. I would highly recommend this high-quality knife set.,5
Very sharp and pretty set,5
i got these to replace an old set that was missing(thanks honey) pieces. it's true apparently they don't make good gardening tools. I've been using them for a while now and can vouch for their build quality. they work very well and i use them every day. it's a lovely set and perfect for someone on a budget or a gift for the child who finally moved out... just saying.,5

"No negatives. This faucet was super easy to install, and it looks great! I needed a way to dispense water from the under counter filtered water system without drilling a hole in the granite. This faucet is the perfect solution. It easily connected to the filter system (Aquasana) without any additional hardware. To dispense the filtered water through the cross bar simply pull the lever straight down. The quality of the faucet is high end, heavy duty and sturdy. I love the way the black and brushed nickel finish goes with my countertop. I also love how firmly the nozzle retracts and stays up without sagging down.",5
I wanted a nice looking faucet that I could use for reverse osmosis & regular water. This fit the bill. Gorgeous & functional! Don’t hesitate to buy it.,5
"Looks great 10/10 and a very easy installationLove that it doesn’t smear or get dirty fastFeels very durable and solid , water flow is amazing high flow and doesn’t leak at all",5
I have made the mistake of going the cheap route with kitchen hardware because brands like Moen and Kohler are always beyond expensive. Kraus feels like a well established brand that continues to try and sell quality products at a great price point. I also got a sink from them (amazon open box) and both looks amazing compared to what we had before. The filtered drinking water option is also a godsend.,5
"Great faucet, absolutely love it. Wanted to save on counter space so needed a faucet that combined RO into the same faucet. Have it for a while already and works great. No complaints at all.",5
Easy to install and very nice quality. Looks great in our kitchen.,5
"Have been using this for over a month now, and it's been great! Good build quality, looks great, and having the filtered water built-in as opposed to needing to drill a separate hole in the counter is really convenient (and works well)! I would highly recommend this faucet.EDIT: Following up again 7 months later, and this faucet is still great! It remains sturdy and still looks great.",5
"Very few kitchen faucets that include a dedicated separate filtered water tap. This saved me the toil of drilling a hole on my ceramic sink for a separate filtered water tap.Works well and is well built, albeit somewhat pricey. Mine was discounted as it was used, otherwise I would have been hesitant. In retrospect I would not have greatly regretted paying full price.Installation instructions were easy to follow.",5
"Perfect product if you have a RO system under the sink and you don't one an extra faucet. Looks really good, and minimal it's easy to install and to use.The colour is a true champagne gold and not as ""yellow"" as it looks in the pictures.",5
"This faucet is awesome for those who wants to add RO water to without drilling a hole. The nut design is super easy to install, it has two Philip screws that does the final tightening; brilliant.For me, I took the old RO water hole and turn it into a glass rinser.",5
"I'll cut to the chase for anyone who simply wants to know if Vitamix blenders are worth the investment. My answer is yes. Unequivocally.This is my second Vitamix. My first one (the 6300) is about 7 years old & STILL going strong, but I was happy to have the opportunity to try this new Ascent X4 because of the presets for many of the things I commonly blend. The 5 presets (smoothies, frozen desserts, soups, frozen cocktails, and last but not least, dips & spreads) take the guesswork out of which settings to use for many of the types of foods & beverages that I make on a regular basis.So far, I've used the presets on my Ascent X4 to blend smoothies & frappes and to clean my container when I've finished using it. (Btw, not that it was difficult to do this manually with my 6300, but I love the self-cleaning feature!) In addition, even though there's no preset for it on this model I was still able to make a great, super-smooth batch of almond butter with help from the ""dips and spreads"" setting, too!More things I love about the Ascent X series:- 10-year warranty -- almost unheard of these days- smart technology that tells me when I should use the tamper (if I'm not already using it)- clever tamper storage that conveniently fits on either side (I'll never need to hunt for it again!)- ability to blend manually without using a preset and includes a ""pulse"" feature- additional 15 seconds can be added with one touch on the ""15+""- motorized base accepts all self-detect containers, including a food processor (I can hardly wait to get that one!)- container is dishwasher safe (it self-cleans exceptionally well but some might like this option)- easy to see when it's *powered on -- lights appear on the display, or off -- no lights (*Btw, the power button is hidden on the lower right side of the base beneath the edge. I say this because I had trouble finding it myself, lol.)I'll end with the fact that Vitamix stands 100% behind their products and the company has STELLAR customer service. If there's any issue with your blender or its components it's easy to contact them by phone. Not only do you get to talk with a real person, but those who answer calls are friendly, knowledgeable & helpful. I speak from experience.",5
"I bought a Vitamix in 1999, and it's still going strong to this day. I have used and abused it over the years and it just keeps on going. I wanted to get a more modern version that has electronic optionsfor pre-programmed features like smoothies, etc. I have to admit that I was a little concerned that Vitamix would follow the trend of many popular, formerly high-quality brands by making products *look* better while lessening overall quality. I'm relieved to report that as far as I can tell, this machine is still a high quality machine that I would expect from Vitamix. The base and motor sounds feel and sound familiar... like an old friend. I love that even though there are pre-programmed functions, you still have the option to run the machine like an old Vitamix. That is, on/off and a dial to hone in on the perfect speed for what you're making. You can turn it on and go without having to navigate menus to find a ""manual"" mode. For professional chefs and experienced home cooks, this is important.The pre-programmed options are great. Combined with the extensive recipe book, you can make flawless recipes! If you're a beginner home cook, this machine could change your life.One thing I made all the time in my previous Vitamix is hummus, so that's the first thing I tried in the new one. And when I say I make hummus, I start by making tahini from sesame seeds and oil. The Vitamix handled this step flawlessly. In seconds, I had a beautiful tahini base for my hummus. Next I added chickpeas, lemon, salt and a bit of water. This Vitamix made a beautiful, super creamy and smooth hummus. I know some people like hummus that's a little rough, but I prefer a super smooth one and that's completely doable in this Vitamix.I was kind of hoping that in their years of R&D that they would have found a way to make it easier to get thick food like hummus out of the canister more easily, but that's a big ask. So I did have to use a spatula to get all the goodness out of the bottom.I have made some smoothies, mayo and potato soup -- all things my previous Vitamix did effortless, and this new model handles all these tasks without complaining. It truly is a beautiful machine and I'm really excited to keep using it and trying new things.My only concern for the future is the electronics side of things. I hope they engineered that as well as the motor and other physical aspects. With the old Vitamix, there are 2 switches and a dial. There's not much to go wrong as long the motor is working. And Vitamix makes powerful and quality motors, which is why my 25 year-old Vitamix shows no signs of slowing down today. Since I can't really test the electronics side of things, I'm really hoping they did put the R&D and build quality into that side of things as well.Overall, I'm super happy with this latest professional grade model and am so happy that Vitamix is still making high-quality and user-friendly products!",5
"I can now make dinner in a flash - and saves my sanity when chopping broccoli.No more mess in the kitchen, it works great and is of really good quality.Blades are sharp and I love the tool to protect your fingers which does not come with the other models I have seen.Does require some strength though - my kids struggle with harder veggies so I had to help.Popped everything in the dishwasher after use and made cleaning up so easy. We love it so far.",5
This chopper is awesome. I have a single chopper but this was is so fast and easy to use and clean.,5
"I have almost nothing to complain about with this kit. It cuts effortlessly compared to the cheaper one I used to have. Doesnt really matter what, onions, peppers, apples, carrots, potatoes, all of them go through it like a hot knife through butter. The ergonomics are great, I will say that I have yet to use the mandoline portion on top. Just haven't had a use case yet. But if the blades in that are as good as they are in the chopper, I don't doubt that it will have just as good as an experience. The storage for the blades is convenient and well thought out. I especially love the little comb that you can use to clean out the plate that pushes things through the blades. It makes cleaning up much easier than any previous chopper that I've used. My only real complaint about this is that the container that the chopped food enters is a bit too short. This both limits how much you can chop before having to empty the container, and it also prevents you from being able to fully close the chopper up with all the blades in their storage recepticles. Its a bit of a nitpick honestly. But it would be nice to have everything securely in one spot without having to worry about anything falling out if it gets tipped over.Other than that, great buy, highly recommend. Also I love the color!",5
"It’s sharp, easy to assemble, and saves time chopping vegetables. Highly recommend!",5
"I got this dicer for 50% off, I think, paying only $30 or so for a normally $60 dicer. This is the first dicer that I have ever owned, although I have used a friend's dicer, and I will say that this cuts through about anything that you would need to dice in the kitchen. Like most dicers, stuff gets caught and stuck in the blades and the platform thingy, and it's a little hard to wash, especially because those blades are seriously sharp. An onion stands no chance against those blades. All of the different tools/slicers are really awesome and work really well for the most part.It isn't quite as big as what I thought it would be when I purchased it, and to give you an idea, most of the time I need to quarter an onion in order for it to be diced correctly and not smush out of the sides. If it's a small onion, you can fit half of it in the dicing area and get it done that way. I am extremely happy with the purchase overall, especially at that price, and it has taken away a lot of frustration and time when I cook. Next time, I will probably get one that's a little bigger, but this is most definitely a game changer by itself. Highly recommend this dicer. Just be careful with those blades! They are super sharp and got two of us bleeding within the first three or four days. Lol",5
"This chopper is just awesome . Nicely built , no cheap plastic . And all blades are sharp .",5
Solid and great quality. The blades are thick and the plastic parts do not feel flimsy. Very useful.,5
Highly recommended,5
"The media could not be loaded. I recently upgraded my kitchen with the CAROTE 11-piece Non-Stick Pots and Pans Set, and it's been a game-changer for my cooking routine. The cream white color gives my kitchen a clean, modern look, and the non-stick surface truly lives up to its claims. Food slides right off, making both cooking and cleanup a breeze. I love that I can use less oil, and even delicate foods like eggs don’t stick, which makes every meal feel healthier and fresher.One of my favorite features is the removable handle, which is incredibly practical. It snaps on and off easily, so I can transfer pots from stovetop to oven or fridge without taking up extra space or needing separate storage for bulky handles. This space-saving design has been perfect for my small kitchen and would be amazing for anyone with limited storage or even an RV setup. Plus, the set is induction-compatible, which opens up a lot of versatility, especially if you have mixed appliances.Overall, this CAROTE cookware set has been an ideal addition to my kitchen. It's lightweight but durable, easy to clean, and does everything I need it to do, from stovetop to oven to fridge. It’s been a worthwhile investment, and I can tell it’s going to last me a long time. If you’re looking for a practical, stylish, and space-efficient cookware set, I highly recommend giving CAROTE a try!",5
"Absolutely amazing!!! Best purchase I’ve done in a while. The coating makes it super easy to cook and food really doesn’t stick, even with small amounts of oil or similar. The removable handles are great and easy to apply and remove. The color is lovely, the little dots give it a little extra something that looks very nice. The fact that you can take them from stove to oven to the table and they still look cute it’s definitely a great extra. Heat distribution is amazing! Everything cooks very evenly! The stacking makes is easier to store and they are also super easy to clean.",5
"I bought these to save my time in the kitchen, and the results are better than expected. I like the detachable handles, since they allow me to squeeze more pots on my stovetop, while eliminated bumping a handle and spilling the contents. They nest well in a drawer, using less than half the space required by my old pots. The non stick coating has held up very well, and I am saving more time than I planned when cleaning them",5
"“I am absolutely thrilled with this CAROTE Pots and Pans Set! The non-stick coating works flawlessly, making cooking and cleanup a breeze. I love the space-saving design – the detachable handle is such a clever feature, especially for storing everything neatly in my small kitchen and even fitting them in the fridge! The cream white color adds a touch of elegance, and the set is versatile enough for all my cooking needs. It heats evenly on my induction stovetop, and being oven-safe is a huge plus. This set has truly upgraded my cooking experience – I can’t recommend it enough!”",5
I've been looking at these for a while and finally gave in and got them. I have an issue with my pots and pans not being able to fit into the cupboard properly number one because they don't all settle into each other perfectly and the handles stick out. So far they seem to cook through very evenly they're heavy weight and easy to clean. They're very pretty looking and it's super convenient to have the handle store next to it. Also the lids are nice that they function is a cover and the whole pan and lid can be put into your refrigerator together or take into another person's house. It eliminates the need for Tupperware. For the price I have found these in extremely good buy and would recommend them to other people,5
"As an avid cook, I’ve been searching for the perfect pots and pans for a long time, and after trying many, I can't believe I didn't discover these sooner! These pots and pans are lightweight yet durable, with a non-stick surface that makes cooking and cleaning a breeze. I ended up discarding half a dozen of my old ones after using these. What I love most is how they store in my cabinet – the detachable handles allow me to stack them neatly, saving so much space. Plus, the inclusion of high-quality felt sheets for protection shows they really care about the product’s longevity. The price is great, and I will definitely buy these again as gifts!",5
"The media could not be loaded. I recently purchased the T-fal Ultimate Hard Anodized Nonstick Fry Pan Set, and it has quickly become a staple in my kitchen. The nonstick coating is impressive – even with minimal oil, food slides right off without sticking. This makes cooking so much easier and clean-up even faster, as I can simply wipe the pans with a sponge and they’re good as new. Another thing I love is how evenly these pans heat up; whether I’m cooking vegetables or frying eggs, there are no hot spots, so everything cooks perfectly. The set feels durable and well-made, with comfortable handles that stay cool while cooking. Overall, this set is an excellent value for anyone looking for quality, user-friendly frying pans.",5
"I'm doing an initial review of this cookware set. As it's being used, my intention is to come back to this review with updates.I ordered this set after doing a bit of 'googling' on what is the best cookware set for 2019 - I wanted something for our gas range. I think it's something to take into consideration when choosing what you're going to buy. An example - on a gas range - if the setting is high and your cookware has some sort of enamel-like finish, and the flames are coming over the sides of the pot/pan - it's going to discolor the finish after a period of time.I looked at the top 10 bracket, the top 5 bracket, I went to reviews, Good Housekeeping, Consumer Reports, just to name two of several, and surprisingly (at least for me) T-Fal was a set that kept popping up as one of the best. I've always thought of T-Fal as one of those starter cookware sets that someone might purchase when they're moving into their first apartment and starting out on their own - it is/was inexpensive - a set for a person learning to cook and therefore not requiring something more 'higher-end.' If you have/had those thoughts as well, you might want to set them aside, at least with this set..Upon pulling everything out of the box my first impression was they look really nice. The set is light weight - the handles are riveted, silicone encased and can withstand up to 400 degree oven temperature. The lids are heavy tempered glass, each one having a small vent hole, and the handles are also silicone encased as well. The design of the lid-handles seems to take into account the use of pot holders since there's substantial space between the glass and the handle itself. All of the lids in my set fit nicely onto their respective pot/pan - no warpage or bent rims. The pots/pans are dishwasher safe (mine aren't going to see the inside of a dishwasher), and this particular set you can use metal utensils (I personally ain't-a-gonna do it). It comes with a steamer that is designed to stack on top of the large pot (not the dutch oven). When you're done steaming, grab some pot holders and lift the insert out by it's handles - no muss, no fuss. It's a much better option than the collapsible steamer I currently using.It comes with instructions on how to care for your cookware. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS! Why you may ask? This set is replacing a Calphalon set, and yes Calphalon was/is rated highly as well. But why replace it? Because being the knuckle head that I am, I didn't read the instructions. I knew Calphalon had to be hand washed (at least the set that I own) - but what I didn't know was what high heat does to the pots. When you read the instructions for T-Fal, and because it's aluminum, it'll say something to the effect of using low to medium heat (because aluminum conducts heat really well). See … I didn't know that about anodized aluminum and what I ended up doing was burning the finish off of each pot and skillet bottom of my Calphalon set - right down to the bare aluminum and of course this affected the non-stick surface on the inside. So please, read and follow the instructions. One other thing before I wrap this up. When I was doing my 'research' I came across this one video of an owner showing how an empty T-Fal pot didn't sit level on her stove. Seems the handle was heavy enough that it caused the pot to tip. She said this was a problem - and I guess it could be if you're in the process of putting something inside the pot in preparation of cooking. I do get that - but I placed an empty pot on the stove, centered over the burner, and it sat just fine - although I'll say my stove grate is different than the stove in the video - it also sat level on the counter top. Perhaps this might be something to take into consideration???So initial impression is the set seems to be of good quality, looks nice, and I'm looking forward to putting this set through it's paces.UPDATE:As of December 4, 2019 I have to say that the T-Fal set has held up extremely well - cooking with this set is a breeze. I keep the burner setting usually at med-high if I want to bring something to a boil - and it doesn't take long for that to happen. The pots and pans conduct heat really well and there's practically no sticking. Usually I can pretty-much rinse off any food residue left behind using just running hot water. I'm pretty good at using either wooden or silicon-type utensils when cooking, though on occasion I've used metal spoons to stir, and there are no marks inside any of the pots/pans. I'm not one of those cooks adept enough to shift a pan around and flip the contents briefly into the air (my cool-factor is not that high) so ""skating"" the bottom of a pot/pan over the cast-iron grate has not taken place, so I can't say what would happen to this set if I were to do so. If I were to hazard a guess, I would say that more than likely there would be some marring of the bottom since cast iron probably trumps aluminum. Overall I'm very please with this purchase and the performance of this cook set.",5
"I try to wait on reviews so that I can provide an accurate and fair review. This was a great purchase. These pans look amazing and are very sturdy. Stick fee is 5 stars. Durability 5 stars. Look new after 6 months. Easy to keep clean. After 6 months no scratches or marks. I will admit that I an very careful about cleaning and us only cloth or sponge as I have ruined other, more expensive brands in the past.",5
"We all have some of these: chipped, scratched pots and pans that wobble on a range because of being WARPED. I've had enough with my pans and began research on cookeware sets. I will note here that my current cookware is the high end non-stick, with my fry pans being those bought after watching some fool on TV melt candy in a wrapper in the pan and then wiping it clean. (These pans by the way are only 8 months old and are already WARPED). For new cookware, my ONE main requirement was that they were or would be NON-WARPING. The second requirement was that they be non-stick. After some research I settled on the 14 piece of T-Fal non-stick / non-warp set. Item came well packaged and unpacking the items I was impressed with the feel of each piece: not too heavy or light even with a lid. I also noted the non-stick interior surface and the very nice looking anodized exterior. Very nice touch with the vented lids (an actual hole in the glass) and the FULL insulation of the handles. Now I mention this insulation because I have (had) cookware items that had decorative (?) metal ends on the handles that would occasionally get very warm while being used.( Nothing like grabbing a pot or pan handle that want to cook your hand medium rare.) I washed each piece and WITHOUT SEASONING, took the largest frying pan, placed it on the range on MED HEAT (about 5-6 on an electric glass top range) and let it heat up. After 2-3 minutes, I noted that the T-FAL center emblem in the pan really didn't look like it changed much. I expected it to go from the T-FAL logo to a full red dot. Didn't happen but it was no biggie as in the past several months I began preheating my fry pans for about 3 minutes due to their warped exterior. Next I added magarine as I was going to cook sunnyside up eggs. I was impressed to note that the margarine melted quickly AND when spread about the pan, little bubbles began to show up over the ENTIRE pan surface. This meant that the pan was heating up evenly. In went the eggs and after placing a lid on the pan I turned away to get something off the counter. Now, with my older warped fry pans I could do this same act, return to the range and begin to slowly rotate the pan to get even heating on the eggs. Not so with this T-Fal fry pan. I noted the whites turning opaque quickly and the yolks getting their whitish color meaning they would be just slightly runny. In short, these eggs came out perfect and in well over 1/2 the time from my old cookware. Even my other half was impressed. Now my next ""adventures in cooking"" will involve sautéing, making my alfredo sauce, grilling (this set came with a VERY NICE grill pan!) and frying. So far I am following the instructions by keeping the range heat at MED or just a bit more. Noted is that one foray into frying eggs does not provide enough experience with this cookware to turn cartwheels in the kitchen. But so far, with eggs being one of my more difficult items to make because of my other warped pans with uneven heat, this T-Fal pan is impressive. So, my rating of 4 is tentative as I will update this review within a short time after I try other pieces of this set.UPDATE:First this disclaimer: I HAVE NOT and AM NOT an employee of T-Fal or Amazon, and I have NOT been hired to write a raving review. That said, now for the update. I have had this set now for over a month and have used all but one of the pans. The total experience has been incredible. I cook out of self-defense (the other half is banned by the EPA from boiling water) and am pretty fast in the kitchen when I am cooking.- WEIGHT OF PANS: I thought the pans were a bit on the light side until I started using them. Whether it was thought of during design or not, the pans are heavy enough to withstand various cooking requirements but light enough where you don't break your wrist when lifting.- NON STICK SURFACE: Come on now! Who in their right mind melts plastic spoons or uses an electric beater on their non-stick cookware! I believe surface of this T-Fal would take this abuse with no problem, but I happen to like my food without the taste of plastic. I've used nearly all the pans and found them all to be amazingly non-stick as well as sturdy. I still use butter/olive oil when sautéing or frying. I have had nothing stick to the pans nor have any of these pans lost any of their non-stick capability.- HEATING: This is the BEST part of this cookware. If you cook/have cooked with slightly warped cookware, you know the problem with hot heat spots or very little heat at all. Thus, you have to move the pan around a bit to get yours items cooked. Each of the pans in this T-Fal set has VERY even heat distribution. There is a ""plate"" on the bottom of the pans that distributes the heat evenly. I have found that because of this, I've noted shorter cooking times on various items AND I now cook on a lower heat settings NOTE: This T-Fal cookware set will cause you to change how your cook and for how long. The even heat distribution is stunning. ALSO, I do preheat my pans (except for boiling water) and use only wooden or high heat tolerant silicone utensils..- STORAGE OF THE COOKWARE: I don't stack this cookware. Instead I hang it up. This simply helps prolong the life of my investment.Overall, I am very impressed with this cookware. Even my other half (known for making ANGRY little pellets called hamburgers), has begun to learn that this cookware can even make her a decent cook. And yes, I bit on the late night adverts showing the frying pans melting plastic spoons and candy in wrappers and magically not sticking. I bought 3. Within 90 days they either lost their non-stick capability, began to warp, or both.Some people are gourmet cooks; others have trouble boiling water. This cookware will holdup very well and serve both very well. My motto is that you get what you pay for. And you WILL get more than you've paid for this set. I raise my rating to 5 stars and I do recommend as a BUY.",5
This set of pots is amazing!! They are truly non-stick which makes cooking and cleaning easier. They are worth the price. I would recommend this set to others.,5
"I've had these for a few months now and they have been fantastic. They seem very sturdy, they are easy to clean and everything I've made in them has cooked evenly and nothing has stuck to the pans. I am very happy with this purchase.",5
"While I can't give you a review on durability yet, I can say they seem nice. All parts cake in that I know of. The silicone seems sturdy, I like the fit of the lids and it stacks rather nicely imo. I don't see how a bowl wouldn't be functional, there's really no way to mess that up. I ordered black and think they look pretty sharp. The tools that came with it are small imo also but I wasn't expecting much, they were just kind of a bonus to me really.Enjoy",5
"These bowls and lids are great. I love the shredder and slicer and they clean up easily in the dishwasher. I recommend placing the lids on the top dishwasher rack to ensure the lids maintain their shape but even on the bottom they maintain their shape and seal if you place them on the bowls and leave them on for a while. The sizes allow you to measure, mix, and store right in the bowls. The silicone base is the best feature and provides a firm foundation as you mix vigorously. The extra measuring tools and silicone utensils are a nice bonus. Would buy again as a gift!",5
"Great set of bowls, the rubber bottom really does a great job of keeping it from sliding. Nice variety if sizes, the lid seals well enough for me to use them for storage as well as mixing. I have been washing them in the dishwasher since I got them with now issues. They store easily as well.Some issues with scratching on the insides if the bowl but not a concern",5
"I've been trying to get rid of my glass mixing bowls and I wanted something durable that wasn't plastic. I saw this set and I gave it a try. Best purchase I've made in a while... I LOVE THEM! Durable with a nice rubber bottom. The lids fit like a glove and they are perfectly stackable. The bonus... is the bowl with the slicing and grating attachments. All I do is open the covered hole on the lid, add the attachment and I slice and grate in the bowl. Save me time and clean up. It came with some silicone utensils, measuring cups and spoon. This was a true bonus buy!",5
They look nice! They fit in my cabinets perfectly. They are good quality and can be used for many things. They work good and are easy to clean. I would recommend these if you like to bake they have many sizes.,5
"I got this to take camping. It works great, love how the bowls stack together. Love the non-slip bottoms. The extras - utensils, measuring cups, etc - where great to throw in our camping tub. The lids aren't water-proof, so if you are bringing stuff home in a cooler full of melting ice, keep that in mind. Otherwise, we love it!",5
"There are many items included with this purchase. The utensils are pretty small, but it all works. The use of the cheese grater and other items is nice to have.",5
I love the size and colors,5
"This is the second one I purchased for gifts; I use one myself in the kitchen. I'm a knife collector, as far as chef knives go. A $200 one will not be better. It has a VG 10 core for edge retention. It looks good. Its high chromium/ Nikkel content makes it rust-resistant. It's full-tang, and, best of all, it's very sharp. Quality, appearance, value, weight, balance, comfort, ease of use, ease of cleaning; It's all there. This is a knife every kitchen should have. Highly recommended.",5
They seem to hold an edge and sharpen well also. a good medium priced tool.,5
I started home cooking and got this knifeIt is smooth cutting meat and vegetablesIt’s almost 3 months but still works like the first day,5
Gorgeous blade and exceptionally sharp that holds an edge even with an aggressive bevel.Full tang blade and is surprisingly weighty but no so unwieldy as to be clumsy.It will be the first knife in the drawer you reach for. We all have that one tool that just makes your life easier.,5
Wonderful cutting edge. Also it is sent in a beautiful box which works well for storing the sharp blade.,5
"I seen a few negative reviews about rust, FYI moisture is the worst enemy to this type of steel.Here is how to care for your Damascus Blade. I collect Katanas, which are all Hand Forged blades.FYI: the picture of knife darkens the blade so you can see the Design.When heat treated and used in a blade this combination holds an excellent edge. The blade will gain an attractive patina with prolonged use as with any Carbon steel based blade. The colour and character of the patina is determined by the type of ingredients and food the blade is used to cut. For example, cooked red meat creates a beautiful blue-grey patina that will be familiar to anyone who has encountered heirloom carving knives.Caring for your blade:Caring for a Damascus steel blade is much the same as for a Carbon steel blade - moisture is the enemy. Once the blade has built up a patina it is much more forgiving, but a fresh Carbon steel based blade will begin to rust in a heartbeat.Never, ever: NEVER!Leave the blade resting in standing waterRest the blade on a damp tea towel, wash cloth, etcStore in direct contact with leatherWash in a dishwasherTo help your Damascus steel knife become a heirloom, there are only a few things you need to do.After use:Rinse clean under running water and wipe dry with a clean clothLightly oil using food safe oilStore in a dry placeWhile your blade is still developing a patina, it is a good idea to quickly wipe the blade down before moving on to a food preparation task not involving the knife.Oiling - (I use Japanese Sword Choji Oil)- https://www.amazon.com/The-Institute-of-Asian-Arts/dp/B0061LS2SY?th=1&psc=1A common mistake when oiling a blade is to use something like olive oil that will go rancid. I recommend Choji oil, as it is food safe, cheap, and readily available.WashingMany people new to Damascus steel knives approach washing their blades with trepidation. Cleaning your knife is straightforward: rinse it under running water, give it a wipe with a lightly soapy dish sponge, rinse it again and wipe dry. If you’re familiar with the term “Bachelor Wash” (or can decipher the connotation), this is all it takes.Refreshing the patternThe Damascus pattern will fade with use - this is normal and easy to rectify. Hot black instant coffee (cheap, nasty, and mixed at a ratio that would kill a large animal) is a mild etchant that is used as the final stage of the Damascus etching process. It is element of process that contributes most to the blackness of the pattern.Here’s how to refresh your own blades:Brew a batch of the cheapest and nastiest black instant coffee you can get your hands on. You’ll need enough to immerse the blade in.Wash the blade, then thoroughly wipe it down with methylated spirits to remove oils and contaminantsImmerse the blade in the instant coffee, heating the coffee back up if it’s gone cold (heat increases the rate of reaction). Take care to avoid getting coffee on the handle.Expect the process to take anywhere between 15 minutes and an hour. Check the blade every 15 minutes by removing it from the coffee and allowing the coffee to drip off. Do not touch or wipe down the blade at any point.When the desired results have been achieved, remove the blade from the coffee then wash as normal before oiling and storing.",5
Very good Quality,5
"The media could not be loaded. The best part is the smooth gliding RAZOR edge this knife has out of the box. It's a Chinese made VG-10 steel, damascus style (I can't verify how many layers this really has), but VG-10 steel has a great reputation. The knife shipped OVERNIGHT and by coincidence, I bought fresh Walleye AKA Pickerel today at the grocery store. I've used a survival knife to do this before, but it left way too much meat on the skin. This knife just slid right through. If you're OK buying a knife made in China, I'd pick one of these up. The hype is real.Downsides:1) Nobody can really say if this is damascus or just damascus style, nor have I used it for more than one task, but without seeing the manufacture process, it may or may not be.Fun facts:The VG10 steel is native to Japan. 9CRMOV10 or whatever the top rated Japanese knives are made of is a Chinese steel, copying the VG10. How can a genuine Japanese chef knife (like most of the top rated ones) be made out of a Chinese composition steel, yet still be Japanese? This Japanese STYLE chef knife is made from higher grade steel than any of the Chinese 9CRMOV10ABC steel used in most top rated competitors and it's cheaper.Good stuff gets made in China, and so does junk. For the price point, VG-10 steel and quality so far, I'd have to say this is an excellent knife and not junk.Update Several months later: I can still shave with the blade. To be safe and remove any micro burrs, I dragged it through a ceramic v shaped sharpener for three passes, applying no pressure other than the weight of the knife. The blade is still scalpel sharp and glides through EVERYTHING. USE A WOODEN CUTTING BOARD! ANY blade will eventually suffer damage if it's slammed into a glass cutting board or countertop enough times. I didn't HAVE to use the ceramic either. Removing any micro abrasions from any blade helps them stay sharp, but not essential for this knife. It stayed razor sharp on it's own, so I take good care of it.The hamon line on the edge and damascus pattern in the blade are incredible! From one steel worker to another: great job! Worth EVERY PENNY!",5

"Ultra sharp (cause it’s new) but I have high hopes. I particularly love the large handles for bigger hands. These kitchen shears cut through anything and at a reasonable price. The best park is since they are like regular scissors instead of that serrated crap, you can sharpen them if they get dull. I started using then to cut herbs and lettuces with great success and no bruising to delicate leaves. I highly recommend.",5
"These kitchen scissors have quickly become one of my most-used tools! They’re super sharp and make quick work of everything from cutting herbs to slicing through packaging with ease. The grip is comfortable, even for long prepping sessions, and the blades stay sharp, handling heavy-duty tasks like a pro. Cleaning is a breeze too—just pop them apart for a quick rinse. They’ve truly replaced a lot of extra gadgets in my kitchen drawer. If you want a versatile and durable pair of scissors, these are a must-have!",5
"These kitchen shears are a huge improvement over our last pair of Pampered Chef scissors from over 15 years ago. They're comfortable in hand, nice and tight, and sharp while not letting the food slip away from being cut. The blade cover is sturdy and snaps securely in place over the pivot for when you're not using the shears.",5
Very sharp and work well,5
"The KitchenAid All Purpose Kitchen Shears are an absolute must-have for every kitchen. These shears are incredibly, versatile and solidly built. The sharp edges make cutting poultry a breeze since I’m mainly using them to cut trim unwanted chicken fats and cubing them for stir fry.Cleanup is effortless and I just use soap and hot water and they come out looking like new every time.",5
"Bought these to replace the Fiesta ones in my knife block. These are sharp and made well. Have used them for months and they are still as sharp as when I got them. They are comfortable and easy to use, even for a left handed cook! No rust from the many washings either.",5
I've had this model for over a decade. It's great. Holds up. And I put it in the dishwasher probably 3-5 times a week and it doesn't rust and continues to function as expected. highly recommend.,5

Great bang for your buck! I’ve been using this brand for years at home and my place of work. They’re amazing! Great quality!,5
These are the most durable and reliable trash bags. My husband and I have been ordering them for a few years now and will never use another trash bag. So great for the price and almost impossible to break.,5
"Good enough bags. I bought on sale thinking they are bags, kind of hard to screw up, and if they are bad well, they were cheap. This is good logic and I am glad we went with it. We have already purchased a second set. No leaking, no tearing. No regerts. They are bags and they work as advertised. Will likely continue to buy.",5
"We fill this with ice and the beverages of the event and set it on the counter. Looks nice and inviting to have glistening ice cold beer, soda or water ready for the taking rather than digging in a cooler. We’ve also used it for a few bottles of wine with glasses at the ready. Very happy with it.",5
"I bought the Twine Rustic Farmhouse Galvanized Beverage Tub for my Christmas Eve Party, and it was an absolute hit! Not only does it look gorgeous with my Christmas Decor, but it’s also super functional.",5
"The handles are very sturdy. The size of this is great. Do be aware that condensation does happen. I love this tin and use it as storage, but have used it to hold ice and drinks when hosting friends. It works great both ways I use it. I love how the twine does not start unwinding like other ones I have had. I would recommend this to anyone!!",5
These are great when entertaining and needing somewhere to keep your beverages cool.,5
The ice melted pretty fast but it didn't leak and it looks nice . Would buy again.,5
