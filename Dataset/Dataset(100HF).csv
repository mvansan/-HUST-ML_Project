"This is a self-published book, and if you want to know why--read a few paragraphs! Those 5 star reviews must have been written by Ms. Haddon's family and friends--or perhaps, by herself! I can't imagine anyone reading the whole thing--I spent an evening with the book and a friend and we were in hysterics reading bits and pieces of it to one another. It is most definitely bad enough to be entered into some kind of a ""worst book"" contest. I can't believe Amazon even sells this kind of thing. Maybe I can offer them my 8th grade term paper on ""To Kill a Mockingbird""--a book I am quite sure Ms. Haddon never heard of. Anyway, unless you are in a mood to send a book to someone as a joke---stay far, far away from this one!",1
"A complete waste of time. Typographical errors, poor grammar, and a totally pathetic plot add up to absolutely nothing. I'm embarrassed for this author and very disappointed I actually paid for this book.",1
"I guess you have to be a romance novel lover for this one, and not a very discerning one. All others beware! It is absolute drivel. I figured I was in trouble when a typo is prominently featured on the back cover, but the first page of the book removed all doubt. Wait - maybe I'm missing the point. A quick re-read of the beginning now makes it clear. This has to be an intentional churning of over-heated prose for satiric purposes. Phew, so glad I didn't waste $10.95 after all.",1
"I feel I have to write to keep others from wasting their money. This book seems to have been written by a 7th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age! As another reviewer points out, there is a misspelling on the cover, and I believe there is at least one per chapter. For example, it was mentioned twice that she had a ""lean"" on her house. I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot, that I decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling. Please don't waste your money. I too, believe that the good reviews must have been written by the author's relatives. I will not put much faith in the reviews from now on!",1
"Rather than scratches and insect droppings, this one has random pixelations combined with muddy light and vague image resolution. Probably the cue should have been the packaging is straight out of your street corner bootleg dealer.If you've ever seen a reasonably good condition film copy, you know the defining visuals of his film are the crystal clear lighting contrasts in black and white. The surrounding countryside and 'old home' scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright, clear, and immediate.Here everything is dull, dark, and clouded. Or, if you remember the timbre and enunciation of Captain's commands, so are the visuals.After that, it is hard to believe this award winning, critically acclaimed film's best presentation is on YOUTUBE. Somewhere ""out there"" is a DVD that comes up to the standard of a 16mm public library reel.Just none of them appear to be on Amazon.",1
"I bought this charger in Jul 2003 and it worked OK for a while. The design is nice and convenient. However, after about a year, the batteries would not hold a charge. Might as well just get alkaline disposables, or look elsewhere for a charger that comes with batteries that have better staying power.",1
"The plot is so ridiculous, I have to wonder if they even read the script before making this film. The mountain lion breaks out of his trailer - and the cars behind don't notice? The mountain lion is captured - and put in a jail cell? Get real! Utterly, completely stupid.",1
"If you have even casually looked into applying to law school, have already read everything there is in this book, do not waste your money, seriously!!",1
"It clearly says on line this will work on a Mac OS system. The disk comes and it does not, only Windows . Do Not order this if you have a Mac!!!!!!!",1
"I bought this for my wife for her birthday,and had toreturn it because the DVD palyer would not work. I returned it and got a repalcement, which once again the DVD player failed to work! It is a piece of junk.",1
"If you want to listen to El Duke , then it is better if you have access to his shower,this is not him, it is a gimmick,very well orchestrated.",1
"The screen arrived in a cardboard box that was pretty beat up. The screen itself is very lightweight, very cheesy looking. The ""finish"" was worn across the entire top of the screen. I knew this wasn't solid brass, but I expected something that at least looked decent from a distance for the price I paid.",1
"I ordered this DVD and received a substitute I never received the DVD I ordered from Importcds (the Vendor). I contacted them and did not recieve any feedback. I can't rate a DVD I have never seen. I didn't bother to send it back because it would have cost me more that I orginally paid for it. In the future I will watch for the name of the person and/or persons I am buying from. I thought they were a good company. I understand a simple mistake but, to not get a response at all is not good businees sense. I spend hundreds of dollars a month on Amazon.com building my DVD collection. I guess I will be more careful in the future.",1
This book drew air pretty bad. I have no idea why someone would waste their time writing it. Boy did it draw air. Do not read this book.,1
"I ordered the cake topper June 27, 2010. I was given an estimated shipping date of July 1-7, 2010. Those dates came & went with no cake topper. I contacted the seller twice with no response. I filed a claim with Amazon. I did end up receiving a cake topper on July 16, 2010; however, it's not even the one I ordered! The seller did refund my money, but has never contacted me or apologized for the mishap. I will never buy anything from the seller again. I looked at the seller's feedback & I'm not the only person they have done wrong, so buyer beware!!",1
"I am disappointed in its performance. It seems underpowered and is constantly trying to read CDs, half the time unsuccessfully. I am going to try to return it to Amazon.",1
"I did not know this was the audio cd of the game, I thought it could be used on the playstation. Maybe the other guys are from the US or somewhere where it is actually easy to get the game,and play it,but this was all in japanese and was not compatible with my machine. I am deeply disappointed as i love the arcade game, but the Dance stage euromix (Dance Dance Revolution equivalent) is lacking in decent tracks, many are jungle-y and are difficult to dance to them. Also, most of these tracks are unheard of here and are therefore not very enjoyable. However, my favourite are Keep on moving, make a Jam, and Video Killed the Radio star. But it gets a bit pedantic if you keep playing on these tracks. If anyone is in the same situation as I am, or those of you who are lucky enough the play on the newest version, can you please let me know where I can order one? I am in dance deprivation/boredom!",1

This book vaguely breezed across history and went into various types of timber structures. The mortise and tenon joints that were illustrated were fascinating but not practical for a home builder.,1
This product smells when you open the package and it appears one of the gel cushions leaks so I spent $10 and havent worn then. I wouldnt buy this product again. Dont waste your money on something you may not be able to use.,1
"I first tried buying this tape from a Marketplace seller. I sent it back because the tape quality was poor and the packaging looked unprofessional. After returning it I bought one from Amazon proper and . . . it was the same quality tape and the same packaging. Since I'm now sure this is not a bootleg tape, all I can say is . . . some videos are better than others.",1
"I should have read the prior reviews of this record before buying it. Although it appears to be a collection of new wave singles from the 80s, these are just cover versions sung by the ""Starlite Singers"". The description of the record says that it is by ""various artists"" implying that they are by the original artists, but this is not true. Total garbage. The one bright spot is that I got a prompt refund when I returned it.",1
"This is one of those cheesy compilations where they find session bands and similar sounding artists to sing the songs. These are NOT ORIGINAL SONGS BY THE ARTISTS. If you loved K-TEL CD's and don't care about hearing the artists originals, and don't care about cheap sounding synthesizers playing the music or that fact that some of the vocalists are pretty bad, then you might like this cd. But if you are a fan of the 80's and the amazing music it produced, then buy other collections and don't waste your money on this schlock!!!!",1
Bought this camera for Christmas. Had her open it first so she could film the nights party & NO TAPES ARE INCLUDED! Of course all stores are closed Christmas day so the thing is USELESS until the day after. Shame on Sony. How much would a tape included in the packace cost them ? Not included Battery chargers are ....,1
"If you purchase this data cable, you need to know that you will receive no real directions or information regarding what to check if nothing works. As directed, I downloaded all of the files from the SE site (70MB on dial up!), and then downloaded all of the user guides. Everything seemed to install ok, but nothing would make my phone be recognized. After that I scoured the SE site for troubleshooting info on their branded cable-in the hope that something would help me figure out the problem. After 2 full days of beating my head against the wall, I finally threw the cable and the useless CD that came with it in the trash.If I had used my brain I would have paid the extra $$ for a SE branded cable and software (and the support that comes along with that). I now have the real deal (SE data cable and software), and guess what? Yep, installation was a breeze and it works beautifully. You really do get what you pay for.",1
"An embarassment. Steer clear of this one folks. Just when you thought these guys were the last real ""fusion"" types about...Since when did the last great secret of the fusion world start taking pointers from Joe Satriani and listening to old Al DiMeola pratice sessions? Where the hell is Phil when you need him, oh yes, Tarzan. The star is for the Bruford and Wilding/Bonus tracks, and well does one really want those?",1
"Molly Myers, in her review of ""My Name is Rachel Corrie,"" describes the ISM as ""an organization dedicated to non-violence."" This is radical left-wing propaganda: ISM offices have regularly been used to hide terrorists and their weapons, ISM ""pacifists"" regularly throw rocks at IDF soldiers, and they're perfectly willing to use violence in order to sabotage the wall intended to keep ""innocent Palestinians"" from murdering Israelis.So please disregard Molly's reviews; they are biased in the extreme.",1
"These are the handful of tracks we hear over and over again. It's far from complete though.Missing such memorable tracks as ""sealed Door"", ""wings across time"" or ""At the Bottom of the Night"".It doesn't have a single battle theme accept the final boss.Hell this doesn't even have Lucca's theme and she's on the cover!Had I seen a track-list beforehand I wouldn't have bought this.I blame my self for not being more curious of the number of CD's.I'm sorry I paid $35 dollars American for this travesty, may Lavos have mercy on my soul.Save your selves(and your money) while you still can!",1
You get what you pay for. This pillow is stiff and smelled like drying paint for 4 days. I thought I was getting a non name brand version of the Temperpedic pillow. I bought the real pillow for my mother years ago and paid many times the price. This thing doesn't even come close.,1
"The pillow I received is nothing like the one in the picture. The pillow that I received is approx half the size (in thickness) as the one I received. I am not happy with the seller (Moshelle's). I will never purchase from this company ever again. I am currently deployed Military and I feel that this company is very disrespectful and does not show it's Military members the proper courtesy when dealing with such issues. Do not buy this pillow, you will not be satisfied.",1
I have been used this product for many years. But somehow the product I received this time is like fake one. It's very thin. I have to used double amount.,1
"I suppose if you were going to sit in the same room and have line-of-sight with the device, lamp, etc. plugged into this control, it might work. Maybe. But I had it completely within the stated range and one basic house wall separating me and the unit, and it was completely unreliable.I'd recommend spending a touch more money and getting a higher quality product.",1
"What am I reviewing here... this gizmo or the supplier, Eforcity? I never received this product after my order! After waiting and waiting I contacted Eforcity several times -- no reply. After a nasty letter from me Eforcity'r reply feigned lacking information about my mailing address!What a cop-out.I told them I would not pay for it, so Eforcity said they'd give me a refund, which has not come to me yet. I bought another product to replace this from Amazon which arrived quickly from Amazon.",1
It worked about 40% of the time when I was standing less than two feet from the outlet. When I moved eight to ten feet away it worked about 5% of the. I would not recommend it.,1
"I never write reviews but I just felt compelled after I saw this video. It's 70% listening to parents and kids think about Thomas and maybe 30% Thomas related. What is worse is that you have to fast forward through a bunch of the rambling in order to see what amounts to a 5 minute story. And, there is only one song in the ""Sing A Long"". I really liked Thomas stories after watching them on PBS with my daughter. Next time, I will try to find those stories on video. They actually last about 15 minutes and do not involve mindless prattle from people I don't know.",1
"Unless I missed something, there are only one or two actual episodes on this DVD. The rest is a long commercial for the Thomas the Train centers and an ode to Ms. Allcroft. Waste of money.",1
"My 2 year old son is huge Thomas fan. This DVD has long introductions to each story in which children and adults are interviewed - my son couldn't care less. He just wants to see trains! We have a portable DVD player, and it is a big pain to try to fast forward past these introductions, and he (and I) just ends up frustrated. My advice - pick another DVD.",1
"Did not like the pants at all, and threw them in the trash rather than pay return postage. Flimsy, smelled of dye, cheap fabric, etc. Too bad.",1
"Merchant was out of stock on the second pair of pants, so when it was shipped I was charged $9 again when the second pair was in stock weeks later.Will not buy from Amazon vendors again.",1
"This is one of the worst written books I have ever read.I wish I had saved my money and my time.The book is full of superlatives. Everything is ""the best ever experienced"" again and again.The characters NEVER become embraceable. One male character is pathetic while the other is a jerk. The female lead is portrayed as perhaps innocently unaware, but is really just stupid. Her friend is promiscuous, which is all we ever really get to know of her.The writing is at a level well below that of an adult reader. But, the content could not possibly be meant for a younger reader. Very inappropriate.Not sure who would really like this book.Maybe someone who really likes descriptions of food and does not care about plot, story development, characterization or any other facets of literature.Find yourself something with a little more substance, and I think you'll be much happier.",1
cash money records is going to have to up with something a lil better than this if they plan on making it in this game.the beats where alright but the rappers a terrible.none of the have a goog flow to accomidate the beats.try again cmr.maybe next time.,1
"ALL I WILL SAY IS THIS WAS A GREAT RELEASE WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT IT AND I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT A FOUR, BUT AFTER HAVING HEARD JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ TODAY (SEPT. 30, 1999) FOR THE FIRST TIME (NOTE: YES, I KNOW I'M LATE LISTENING TO JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ) I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH MANIE FRESH AND JUVENILE. JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ IS THE BEST CD SINCE SNOOPS'S DOGGYSTYLE AND DRE'S CHRONIC. BUT THIS CD IS NOTHING COMPARED TO JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ! IF YOU DON'T HAVE 400 DEGREEZ, GO BUY THAT ONE INSTEAD OF THIS!",1
This is what is in the dictionary under wack. I can't belive that this many people bought this (...) The hot boys are just a fad like bellbottoms. (...) If you think this is what rap is about u just plain stupid and I'm glad this hot boy stuff is almost over wit. When some of my friends play this crap in the car I just rather get out and walk.,1

"I got this throat spray in a hurry hoping to relieve my 3.5 yo daughter from a bad sore throat. It tastes awful, and it's just not meant for a young child. I got it after a recommendation from another mom, and it was a bad decision. I'll keep it to numb a scratched-up knee or elbow.",1
"I listened to the audio version of ""Cruel & Unusual"" on a recent trip to New Jersey and back. The first 2/3 of the book kept me on the edge of my seat, then... the whole thing collapsed in a heap at the end. Would have been much better if the author had stuck to writing a taut thriller instead of trying to drag in everything from evil Republican office holders to Nazi war criminals, all dumped into the mix at the last possible moment. After all the buildup, the ""who"" of the whodunnit ends up being... nobody in particular. And the fate of the evildoer? Nothin' much. Disappointing. Won't bother with Dr. Scarpetta or Ms. Cornwall again.I'm a little baffled by all the reviews that say, ""great book, bad ending..."" and still give it 3 stars or more. Isn't a mystery DEFINED by the ending, by how the author ties up all the loose ends and red herrings?",1
"In a word, Lacking. Her style of writing left me unable to appreciate the underlying story which, as a result, I found rather vacuous and inauthentic. So much so that I felt compelled to come write a review of this book so others might avoid making the same mistake I did. No offence Patricia.",1
"This movie was not only NOT funny, but it was excruciatingly boring. I think Adam was channeling the Aristocrats. Whilst Aristocrats was not as funny as it thought itself to be, it was still better than this garbage.",1
Entertaining in places but spoilt by lots of crudeness and dirty talk that degrades woman. In the end I found nothing memorable or funny about this film. Sad for Adam to seem him in such a trashy film.,1
"I used to enjoy Sandler's movies but this one is just....jeez, how to put it? Well, UNFUNNY.All characters are if not stupid, shallow and egotistical...Don't care how 'dramatic' was this supposed to be, his misogynistic prick persona is the worst ever. Just, don't watch it, really...You'll want those minutes from your life back.",1
"I should have known going into this movie having Judd Apatow a part of it would mean I would hate it. However, having Adam Sandler in it and seeing the previews in the theater we gave it a (very hopeful) chance. The movie loses it's true premise of having depth in amongst the terrible & crude ""jokes"". I have to say we didn't make it more than 30 minutes into the movie before turning it off. It is a constant barrage of pathetic behavior. I just don't believe that there are this many people out here that are like this and can relate to this behavior. Very Disappointing.",1
"I seriously did not expect a dramatic look into the mind of a comedian when I rented this movie. They marketed this movie like the Forty Year Old Virigin and Knocked Up! When I rented the movie I expected a lot of humour and with so many funny actors I put way too much faith in it. My wife and I was so disappointed that we stopped watching it. I don't watch a lot of TV, but when I do watch something I want it to be worth while.If you're into these artsy films about the serious life of people in the spotlight, then you're going to like this film. However, if you're looking for humour like Adam Sandler's previous films (i.e. Happy Gilmore, etc) then you can forget about it.I give this film 1 star because this is not my kind of movie and it was advertised like a great comedy film not drama film. :/",1
This is one of the worst movies I have seen. The dialogue is awful. There is ZERO humor. All the characters are boring and completely humorless.What a loser movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
"Anything with Adam Sandler in it is supposed to be funny. This however, just, well, wasn't. I really do believe that this movie had potential, but there was so much going on, so many stories within the story, that they could have made 3 movies out of it.It's 2 and a half hours long. That's about an hour and a half too long for the main story plot. This movie honestly seemed longer than Titanic, or Gone With The Wind because it is so long and drawn out.There is very little humor in Funny People. The only good thing about it is all the major stars that pop up here and there, which is probably why, in my opinion at least, that this movie even made it to the big screen and didn't go straight to DVD.",1
A truly great example - of how terrible some movies have become!! Vulgar!! Offensive. Unnessisary nudity!! I usually love Adam Sandler - and can't believe he'd stoop so low in this role. Seth is highly likeable in this - but still swears and lowers himself as well. The woman who plays Adams 'romantic interest' is mostly great - but also stoops to swearing - blantant sexuality. The writing is the worst in this movie. This awful movie is 2 hours and 22 minutes long - but only feels like 5 hours. - And I could have spent my life doing something more interesting and exciting like watching paint dry or grass grow. I suggest skipping this movie altogether!! Tragic where movies have gone to. Much has been lost!!Scott MacNeil - comedian.,1
Honestly if you don want to hear a lot of swearing you wont like this. Let alone the story line was ridiculous. Wouldn't recommend!,1
"I normally love Sandler's movies but this was just horrible. None of it flowed right, jokes were horrible vand stupid and just all around made no sense. Don't waste your time and money on this.",1
I must say I never liked Adam Sandler. There were so many more talented people who just never got a chance to be on the screen. I still don't get what's with Adam Sandler.Besides that I decided to give it a shot. It took half hour when I stopped watching.,1
How can anybody even smile with the kind of garbage Adam Sandler ALWAYS performs?This guy is just a moronic retard.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON HIM.,1
"This movie was not an original concept. The jokes were lame, as were the performances. The writer and director disappointed the audience by using Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill as a box office draw. When in fact, it wasn't worth the money to see this film in a theatre.",1
"Save your money. Your time can be MUCH better spent. This was one of the worse movies I ever sat through. Actually, I drifted away close to the end and was thankful I didn't waste that time. Its AWFUL.",1
Not worth the time.Pros: there were several good one-liners; introduced me to new comediansCons: excess foul language; adultry;,1
"This is a nasty, mean-spirited book that exhibits contempt for the Torah and Torah values. When I picked up this book at the local library, I assumed that I would just love it and want to buy a copy for my college-age daughter (who is also a cat-owning Rabbi's daughter). But this isn't just some loveable cat regaling us with home-spun, and potentially Torah-based wisdom. No, this cat uses bad language, is obsessed with masturbation and, on occasion, likes to grab the nearest lady cat and ""show"" her (and us, unfortunately) a thing or two. (Anyone for cat pornography?) Oh, and the lovable rabbi ends up desecrating Shabbos (the Sabbath) and eating trefe (non-kosher) food in a crisis of faith brought on by finding out that his daughter's new husband is not strictly observant and his family is not at all observant. Warning: this book is not suitable for children!",1
"This is the tale of a kindly Rabbi, his sweet daughter and the cat who loves her. The tale seems promising at first, until it delves into bitterness over God and those who love Him and follow His laws. The cat represents the glorification of sin itself, and delights whenever the book's characters fall into ungodly habits, judging them forever as hypocrites (taking no account into repentance and future avoidance of said sin). As is the case with most humanist literature the story down spirals from that point until it ends with the Rabbi losing faith in God. At this point the cat is truly happy with the Rabbi, thus giving the tale a 'happy ending'. In short, 'The Rabbi's Cat' is a tale structured to appeal to secular humanists, atheists and pagans who want to feel better about their self-serving, do as you feel, lifestyles.One more note: This book, despite the beautiful artwork and appealing cover, is definitely not appropriate for children.",1
"As someone who is interested in different cultures, I thought the book would be an interesting window into other people's thoughts. Instead, I open it to find a swearing cat (he uses the F word) denigrating religion and showing religious people as hypocrites, in a lame stereotypical way. Might be interesting to others, but its not interesting to me. Not only is it not suitable to children, but there are a lot of adults who would not want to be bothered with this kind of disrespect and vulgarity either. I wish I had been warned before I tried to read this book.",1
"Jean Hill's story changed with the wind. She saw next to nothing during the assassination, but used her unique location (and her active imagination)to keep herself in the limelight for years. It got so bad that even the conspiracy writers were shying away from her toward the end. It was laughable.Someone needed to ask her about the ""little dog"" she said was sitting in the car with JFK and Jackie. (Look at the original interviews- she actually said it.)This book is BS from stem to stern. Go read a fairy tale, at least there's a moral at the end. The only thing you find at the end of this book is your wallet a little lighter!",1
"This DVD was entiled ""Seventh Cliburn Competion, 1985"" It was not the competion program, and did not even contain the winning performance. I consider it to be a total fraud and misrepresentation.",1
"Well, that's no fun. Honesty is the best policy, right? This was the first of Patricia's books I had the displeasure to become acquainted with. I've tried reading another of her works, but I can't get over the simplistic writing with unnecessary adjectives thrown in for no apparent reason except, perhaps, to make the sentences longer and make the reader suffer from the protracted tripe. More than that, this book failed to make me care about the characters or about the outcome of the story",1
"This could be the worst novel I have ever read. It is also the first and last Patricia Cornwell novel I will ever read. There are so many problems with this book that they cannot be listed here, so here are but three points: 1) The main character, Kay Scarpetta, is an insufferable, humorless snob. I'd never before read a novel where I hated the main character. Great job, Pat! 2) About 90% of the novel is dialogue. Very bad dialogue. But this is understandable since Cornwell cannot write prose. 3) The story is predictable and boring, and the ending is utterly ridiculous. I'm astonished that this book was ever published, let alone made the bestseller lists.",1
"This book is so unrealistic that it spoils all the fun, super killers like Temple Gault (a clone for the Satan Incarnate known as Hannibal Lecter) are more silly than super. I found all the other character two dimensional and all the ""intrigue"" regarding super computers insulting to my intelligence. Has Cornwell done better? I don't know and, after reading this, am in no big hurry to find out.",1
"At least, that's how I felt about this book, which seems only to have been published because the author has written some truly interesting previous novels. I recommend the first three books in the series. I cannot recommend this book for anything except kindling. However, not having a fireplace, I filed this under G.",1
"Noisy, crude five point vibration pad.NOT! a massager, a vibration pad!We purchased three of these and we sent back three of these!Worthless, no, worse than worthless!",1
"The authors seem unaware of the fact that theory guides our understanding. There are no ""objective"" facts, yet the authors present all their findings as such with almost no reasoning attached. This is both arrogant and ignorant. The authors display no grasp of theoretical advances in Accounting and I recommend getting a book that has a better exposition of principles as more than practice",1

"I am in my 60's and thought it would be a good time to remedy what I perceived as a gap in my education, economics. I never had a course in economics and the only book I had read was Heilbroner's Worldly Philosophers, a satisfying but very general overview as I recall. I probably read Heilbroner in the late 70's.I'm an audible subscriber and got Economics in One Lesson from them. I can only say that the book was dated, full of economic events that were referenced from WWII, and excessively polemical and rigid.I read it some time ago but it made enough of a bad impression on me that when I saw it in my suggestion list around number 250, I just had to get onto this page and say what a terrible disappointment the book was.I think the book should be retitled, Economics in One Polemic: The Shortest and Surest Way to Understand the Economics of the Late 1940's and the 1950's.",1
"If you want your faith in market forces and low taxation reinforced, this is a straightforward, but blinkered attempt to make you forget all about government regulation. Funny that west-European countries with bigger taxation and more government influence have less crime, better education, better health care, better TV programmes than the US. They also organise their politics better, so that the tax money is better spent. It did set me right on one or two points, and parts are written in a spuriously funny way, but it is too biased to be really informing . Clearly the writer has never listened to people he doesn't agree with.If you have an open mind compare this dangerous nonsense with the writings of Naomi Klein to see how unfettered capitalism works out in practice.",1
"Wow, this one is really out there. Only Any Rand and Ron Paul, who know nothing about economics, could recommend this book. For example, consider these laughable claims, that I paraphrase -The primary problem with economics as practiced is that no thought is given to the long term consequences of policies to all groups.There is no difference between supply and demand.The vast majority of economists are ignoramuses.It is all very simple; listen to me.If you can believe this stuff, read the book. You can get it online for free.",1
Started laughing in the second chapter....enjoyed the book after I realized that I wasn't going to learn anything new. It's obviously a miracle that we survived for the 65 years since it was first published.And seeing that the pending insolvency of the US was as loudly shouted in the 40's as it is now was worth the price. This book had quotes that would shame both modern day political extremes in the US.Kudos to whoever owns the copyright --- now there's economics in action.,1
I wish I had read more of the reviews to learn that this book is less about economics and more about pushing a particular political point of view. The point of view is hard right and the current recession disproves most of the economic patter. After skimming a few pages I threw it away; I didn't even want it in the house.,1
"This is propaganda, not an economics lesson. The book is full of faulty logic apparently spewed to promote a libertarian agenda. I couldn't be less happy with this purchase.",1
"Threw this book right in the trash not even a chapter into it, because I realized it is nothing but the same old recycled and obsolete right-wing drivel that we've been peppered with over and over, and that took our country to the edge of a second Great Depression. If you are a concerned American you should stay away from this book!",1
"This book was about witches and possession. I do not believe in those things. I am a Christian! I did not like this book very much at all! I don't think this is a good book for kids to be reading, because they might have nightmares. Some of the stories are hard to comprehend. But if you do like those kind of things you will enjoy this book! Thank you for reading my review.",1
I just ordered this fudge. It looked so good and seemed to be priced well I thought I would give it a try. I have looked at just about every store where we live and can not find any maple fudge. I am hoping this will taste as good as it looks. I will send another feedback after I have had my first bite. Can't wait.,1
"After trying three different sizes,I still couldn't find one that fit. I first ordered a medium and it wouldn't even come close to hooking so I went up to size to xlarge which was waaay to big, my last possible option would be a large and it was still huge, wish I would have sent it back but was just tired of the whole process and kept it. The hooks are a pain as well and it is way over priced.....there is a zippered option on amazon that is much cheaper.",1
"I've been wearing the waist clincher for the last two years. I purchased a new one recently and it's not the same type of material of the previous ones i've brought. I thought maybe because i had lost weight, so i brought a smaller sizer, but that one didn't fit the same either. I thought i found a miracle when i first purchased the girldle through Amazon, but i have found my recent purchase has surely let me down...",1
"I ordered according to the size chart for my measurements and it was way to small!! Very uncomfortable.I returned it,",1
"The Sizes run really small, It flips up even though, they said it would not and the hooks don't hold. I am very dissapointed.",1
"I think this product provided a great fit. I was able to hook on the first row by myself within about 5 mins max. It wasn't quite as difficult to get on as I thought it might be, although it isn't particularly easy either. I tried it on and wore for about 2 hours, and then the 2nd time I wore it had it on for about the same period of time. I took it off and one of the metal boning pieces had popped through and was hanging out at the bottom. This product is far too expensive to have something like that happen. The fit on me was snug, but I am sure I had the correct size. Now I have to figure out how to get this resolved.",1
"It was really easy to put the Squeem on, but once it was on I couldn't wait to get it off!! It wasn't too tight or anything. The problem was that once I stood up straight it bunched up in the hip/mid back area and pinched my skin! It was so painful! No matter how I positioned it, it would bunch up! Really disappointed since it was a waste of $50..",1
I really wanted this item to work because everybody seemed to love it. It didn't hold anything in on me and it gave me back boobs. Waste of money for me.,1
"I washed it before used it for the first time. The next day I wore it, I found my skin were itchy all over place on my stomach. And I feel that the heat on my body trapped on that.",1
"I ordered this product to slim down my stomach. I was looking for something I could wear all day with my jeans as well as underneath my dresses. I wore the squeem to work occasionally and then I would take it off when I got home. When I would take it off, I felt sore around my sides and my back, I washed the squeem several times and even wore it on the other side thinking this would help but it didn't. One night after work me and some of my coworkers went out for drinks so I ended up keeping the squeem on for about 14hours instead of my normal 9 hours. That night when I took the squeem off I had blisters and bruising on my side and back which have now left black marks (I'm black)on my body. I read other review before I purchased the squeem and I didn't see anything that alerted me not to buy it. Not sure why this happened but if you read this and it happens to you don't say I didn't warn you!",1
"The Squeem is a great idea, but their quality is second rate, and their customer service is worse than useless. I'd owned mine for about 4 weeks and worn it only a few hours a day when I noticed that a seam was coming unstitched. The threads aren't frayed; they're unstitching from the seam.Contacting customer service has been an exercise in futility. They've asked for pictures of the damage, and then failed to respond to the pictures, or any further attempts to contact them.For what this costs, it needs to last longer than 4 weeks.",1
So according to the size chart on the box size small is for waistline 28-31my waist is 28 so i got the smallit does not even come close to being able to close and clasp!maybe it's just me but i am terribly disappointed,1
Usually a size XS to S but this girdle's small did not fit true to size. Had to return back to Amazon.,1
"It's pretty awesome for such a price! It definitely gives you great posture, I was sitting up straight like no other! although i wish they could improve on the rubber smell otherwise it's wonderful!^^^^^ was my review when i had it for 15-20 days, now-- after ordering it on Jan, 21, 2012-- it's SO useless. I've washed it with care, it smells like rubber, and it's pretty nasty. I'd rather pay $$$ and buy something that works the way it should.",1

"As most people readers know, Jack Higgins has written many fine action-packed books. However, this book reads like a twelve-year-old wrote it. The characters are so transparent they could be ghosts.The author and his publishing house must really need the money to rip of the public in this manner. This is the last book I read by this author. One can only rest on his laurels for so long. I'm glad this book was handed down to me or I would have written a really nasty review.",1
"Where did the real Jack Higgins go? This is not only Higgin's worst effort to date, it is probably the worst book I've read in the past 5 years. (Can you say 'lazy', Jack?)I can't believe I actually finished it, and one star is a generous rating. Unbelievable chapter after unbelievable chapter, no character or plot development, written like a 5th grader.The end of the book foretells a sequel...a book that I will immediately pass on. Probably my last Higgins book without reading the reviews first.Don't buy it -- don't borrow it -- don't read it.",1
This book is not well written and leaves nothing to the imagination. If I hadn't bought it in hard cover and spent the money I would not even have finished reading it.,1
I bought this for a friend and watched it with him. I knew it would be bad and it was. I guess if you like this kind of thing then it would be good for you. I on the other hand have taste.,2
"Bad special effects, a completely wooden plot nailed to cardboard characters, bad acting and cheesy gore effects do not compliment would could have been a very scary movie. Inexplicably incestious Cat people live like cia undercover agents in a small town, and stake out victims to gain energy. There is no explanation as to what these creatures are, and basically the whole thing is a solid vehicle for a bunch of scenes involving painfully conspicious latex prop limbs being torn and split while the creatures feed off of the energy of fresh victims (one scene where a man has his hand cut off actually rivals luke skywalker's incredibly unconvincing appendage loss in ""The Empire Strikes Back). The cat people themselves are reminiscent of japanese rubber suit monsters (one almost expects power rangers to jump out) and the morphing special effects look ridiculous. Entertaining enough to warrant watching the whole thing ... even If not for any reason it intended to be.",2
"Well the it starts out pretty good. the plot is alright, the actors are pretty good and the special effects are amazing for when it was done. Then in the end it all gets wacky... almost like a comedy. One scene when the seriously dissturbed mom (Alice Krige) kills a guy whit a corncob! But when it really gets bad is in the end when you see how the ""sleepwalkers really look...",2
"It's terrible! About the only thing it had going for it were the special effects and the musical score. Don't get me wrong, I love Stephen King, and I love scary movies, but this one is just plain sick.",2
"This CD just about drove me nuts. I understand that rain is to be expected in a rainforest,but after listening to this recording my pets were lining up two-by-two. This CD is for you if you love a long rain and dripping sounds. I hated it; it was monotonous and I could swear that there were portions that were repeated because the person recording it had to fill up some space and nothing was available.Save your money!",2
"This book is not an easy read; to many diversions within the story to get excited about the character. It hurt my ""head"" to try and stay with it. I enjoy reading, but this book takes the joy out of reading! It has taken me months to get to the 6th chapter",2
"Very average movie, Jonny Debbie as wonderful as ever. If you want to see it then rent it, not a keeper",2
"Yes, Johnny Depp provides another great performance here, as does most of the cast. The story line is what drags this movie down. Beyond the slew of predictable lines and scenarios, I found the message of the film a bit shallow. ""Love conquers all...including schizophrenia."" It's just not life-like. Some of the imagery and allusions are heavy-handed at times. I wanted to scream, ""OK, I get it."" Not a terrible film, but not that great either. If you want to see a more compelling Depp film, see ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape.""",2
"Benny (Aidan Quinn) is the brother of an autistic girl named Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson). He's a bit restrictive and protective of her. Sam (Johnny Depp), the ""quirky"" guy, moves in. Hilarity ensues. So, what's the problem? The moviemakers were not content with making a funny, lighthearted movie. Instead, the movie gets very serious and preachy about several points - whether or not Joon can live on her own, whether or not Sam needs to get a job, etc. These questions are presented as ones with obvious answers, because, of course, love conquers all, as we learn in Hollywood. Sam is portrayed as the truly wise character of the movie, while crazy old Benny is still stuck on backwards ideas like earning money to provide for yourself and caring for the mentally handicapped.There were a few funny parts, courtesy of Johnny Depp, but I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie.",2
"Although Johnny Depp is to be lauded for his deft physical comedy in this romantic fairy tale, it isn't enough to save this implausible film. Depp plays a somewhat eccentric young man who finds himself filling in as a ""housemate"" to a young mentally ill girl who lives with her brother. Mary Stuart Masterson is effective as Joon, and Aidan Quinn does her sincerest best but the film ultimately fails in its ignorance of reality. Julianne Moore has an early appearance as Ruthie, the failed actress who works as a waitress and befriends Benny, Joon and Depp. The movie manages to sugar coat mental illness and we're asked to believe that this obviously disturbed young girl is capable of living on her own. While its message of love conquers all is admirable, the reality of Joon's situation is overshadowed by this sentimentality.",2
"what a boring and pretentious movie! after tortured about 15 minutes, all the family members started to look each other or one another, then all agreed at the same time to reject this stupid shallow movie. depp or no depp, after twenty years, he's still playing the similar roles again and again, and never grows tired of it. but to me, and to us, enough is enough.",2
"This book was okay. It spoke about how gays deal with sexual orientation issues in the workplace. The good thing about it is that it included case studies of a gay black man and a bisexual white woman; so the authors were trying to think about diversity within the LGBT community. However, this book is simplistic and doesn't say much. There are large-scale studies and anthologies out there about gays in the workplace that are more thorough, and just better. You should consider reading this, after you've read all the other stuff on the topic.",2
"Let me just say, I loved the movie Pearl Harbor. But I found the soundtrack to be disappointing. I bought it for the Faith Hill song ""There You'll Be"" If you are like me, I recommend the single.",2
"The so-called soundtrack for ""Pearl Harbor"" is a major disappointment. The film was full of great period songs and music. None of them are on the soundtrack. Instead, you can enjoy an hour of absolutely forgettable, mediocre orchestral background music. OK, the theme song is stirring, at least the first two or three times. But the rest is a real bore. When I want to listen to orchestral music, I go to Bach, Brahms and countless other true pros. Don't get bamboozled by this one!",2
"While the movie Pearl Harbor is amazing, the soundtrack does not follow suite. It begins with a mediocre ballad by Faith Hill and the remaining 8 songs, while nice to listen to, are not Hans Zimmer's best work. Tracks 2-4 are so similar it's hard to tell accompanies the numerous TV trailers. For a 3 hour movie, I them apart. It does not include the powerful music that expected a much longer soundtrack. I'm sure we'll get more music when a follow up CD is released. One will no doubt be released so that consumers who want a better soundtrack have to shell out more money.",2
"I bought this CD for Faith Hills song and hoped the rest of it would be good also. For a movie like this, and an event like this, the music just doesn't fit.There should be some very big, building music here and there isn't. It could have been much better.",2
I was disappointed in this soundtrack. The introductory and final songs were lackluster sentimentality. I would have hoped for something more from the producers. The instrumental offerings lacked excitement and musical tension. I would have though Zimmer would have known better.,2
"Zimmer mostly just rehashes past themes from other films he's done, then throws in a track collaborated on with Faith Hill and some generic period-type music. Big deal. The film stunk and the uninspired score just had me thinking how much better the other films he's worked on were. Zimmer's better than this. The same can be said for most of the directors he usually works with. Perhaps it was just a paycheck to him...who knows.",2
"after last year's majestic score for gladiator, i had high expectations for the pearl harbor soundtrack. much to my dismay, the music no more than ""sorta pretty"". it evokes no feelings like gladiator's worldly mood. plus, with all due respect to mr. zimmer, the defining chord sounds awfully familiar to a Enya song some years ago (i think it was enya). i don't need the faith hill song...... plus, unlike the gladiator score which the listener could visualize the story, the same isn't true with this release of the soundtrack. PLEASE GIVE US MORE MUSIC WITH A SECOND RELEASE!!",2
"Having read Ms. Manning's book, it is obvious that she has somehow managed to overlook perhaps the most important pioneer and innovator of what she calls the ""free energy"" movement:JOSEPH W. NEWMANIt is incredible to me that she could write such a book without including Joseph Newman's long struggle to bring forth his revolutionary technology. Writing such a book without featuring the work of Joseph Newman is as ridiculous as writing a book about the history of aviation and omitting any reference to the Wright Brothers.I would suggest that she view his website videos at:... and perhaps she would discover the essential nature of his successful and innovative technology.Gary",2
"Unfortunately percussion has completeley spoiled all tracks.This is not Bossa Nova,not even Samba.Sorry for a great project with great arrangements.",2
"One month ago (and even earlier) this set was selling for less than half ($41) this current price ($89). While it was a great series that I thoroughly enjoyed watching as a kid, my desire to finally buy it for Christmas has been completely eliminated by the equivalent of holiday induced price gouging. I'll wait till it goes back to a reasonable price. More than a little upset with Amazon over this one. Merry Chri$tma$.",2
Unlike most SciFi shows this show had NO BASIS IN FACT. I must have been much more forgiving as a kid I remembered liking this show at least a little but after watching it again the bazaar story lines and unforgivable scientific inaccuracy I have to give this a total thumbs down.,2
"Not sure whether the original recordings were not preserved well or just our copy is bad, but the sound cuts out frequently on each episode. Would not buy this again.",2
"Even while some of the episodes are questionable and not very realistic, this is a classic show now. Having two seasons, the special effects of the time is still top-notch. While the acting is mediocre, and the story set up is sometimes way out (It was the 70's) there is some entertaining value. As a writer, I still look through this medium to see if there were any parts that can be embellished for newer ideas. What toppled the ratings of this show was the ""Mind"" entity beings that appeared on the first six or so episodes. But after that the writing started to switch to a more action oriented show. I am still looking through the DVD's as I try to remember the better episodes. Quality of picture is fine on widescreen TV's, but this is not an HDTV product.",2
"I found the book to be very general and basic. Most of the information I already knew. There are methods of retrofitting old windows I have seen on home type programs that lightly discuss these topics and which the book does not. Also, the book could use a lot more diagrams and discussions on finishes and paint. The book limits itself to actually restoring to original working condition old windows and nothing about updating. This book is for beginners except that for beginners there should be a lot more pictures. I did find some good tips but not the information I was personally hopeing to find. I am selling the book back.",2
Goes a mile wide and an inch deep. I would rather the same book but each chapter by an expert in that area with a lesson/example.,2
"The FM stereo does not pick up well at all. I cannot get many local stations. The description says it uses USB 1.1 for quick transfers. This is misleading advertising. USB 1.1 is the slower transfer method. USB 2.0 is the faster one.Where this device excels is in conjunction with a MP3 player. The rechargeable battery means you can use it away from a power supply for a long time. The sound is excellent.This would get 3 stars due to the slower transfer speed, false advertising, and poor FM. It gets 2 stars because the price is too high for a refurbished model.I got this for $19.99 directly from Philips web site. I would check there first.",2
"Ok, so I have not actually heard this WHOLE cd. I did hear Bob sing on The Bachelor show and was impressed, but then I heard ""his"" first single, Girlfriend, and was less than impressed. This is for two reasons: a) Bob doesn't really have the rock vibe, which just makes his version of Girlfriend sound wrong (in his defense, the song I heard him sing on tv was Open Arms by Journey, an excellent song, and not easy to sing I don't think). b) I can't deal with the fact that I have not heard Bob publicly credit the originators of the song Girlfriend. The July For Kings version is 100 times better than Bob's, and while I know the band probably appreciates the publicity, they are not getting all the credit they deserve. Check out JFK's cd ""Swim"" and make your own comparison, though if you like Bob's single this CD will likely not disappoint your tastes.",2
"I kinda liked this book for awhile. Some strange humor and interesting to see what is was like to travel at the time of Twain. I thought it was a litte long and boring and though (only read 3/4 of it). Not very exciting and a lot of quotes from other esoteric sources. Also, he makes reference to Arabian nights while in India. Aren't those stories set in the middle east and north africa? (kinda lame)",2
This was a great deal if it had worked. The gas regulator had leak by when set to zero. Amazon was not good about sending a new one they said the price had gone up and I would have to pay the new increased price. I just got a RMA and returned it. Could not get the seller on the phone. Tired of messing with it went to welding supplier and bought new. Some things just should be bought locally.,2
This product does an adequate job of cleaning your feet and does provide some relief for tired aching feet !,2
"I pre-ordered this foot massage spa to relieve niggling pain in my feet. Though the product operated exactly as per the manual, it was rather tame. It didn't really help reduce the pain, rather it merely tried to soothe the feet. Your feet will feel good so long as they are in the spa, but the spa does nothing to reduce the pain. I didn't think its worth spending so much money to just put my feet in hot water (& that too without salts). I've returned the product.",2
"Bought this unit directly from Brookstone over 6 months ago. Was initially great very hot water and jets were comfortable but stopped working after 4 uses. Brookstone would not replace because after it was after ""limited"" warranty coverage. This was an expensive unit and not sure if I would get another one from Brookstone or try cheaper model that hopefully won't break down.",2
I loved the idea of this foot bathbut the product leaked. Brookstone was great to work with for the return.,2
"I purchased this item thinking what I read about it here on Amazon would be true. Unfortunately the heated foot bath and Message is not what it sounds like. The heated part works ok, but as far as the message part, not even close. And the jets, come on, give me a break. For what I paid for this, over $100.00 and the most expensive one that Amazon had at the time I thought I would be getting a good foot bath. If I had to rate this from 1-10 I would give it a 3. Only because it does keep the water warm. In my opinion it is not worth the money or even half of what I paid for it.",2
"Bought this thing as a gift for my wife. She was really excited to get it. Used it twice, with out any salts, and it worked great. Third time she went to use it, the jets didn't work. Got a hold of the company who sold it, and they said no problem, just send it back. So I'm thinking they are going to send me a new one, that works. Made me pay the return shipping, and just put the money back on my credit card.If I sold a defective item to someone, I sure as hell wouldn't ask them to pay for return shipping.",2
"By the time this 9th entry in the Jason Voorhees franchise was released, the series had become tired and ultimately redundant. In an effort to put more life in it, we are faced with a Jason who is killed but like in THE HIDDEN (a far superior film), he manages to live using host bodies. Although the screenwriters try to give us more motivation for Jason's murderous rampage, there is little suspense or novelty in the movie. Jason manages to kill off a few people, and his sister is recruited to finish him off. No real acting honors in this one, although Steven Culp manages to do well in his role as a tabloid tv producer. The ending is a joke in itself, with its reference to future Jason adventures. Not the best in this series.",2
"I cant beleive they did this, they added a crapy plot, ""only a vorhees can kill a vorhees"" WTF??!!!!???!! jason had a sister? what a stupid plot, then at the end you see freddy's hand grabbing jasons mask and pulling it down under the ground (telling me freddy vs. jason is next).if you want to collect the friday the 13th film's i sugest part's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and X.",2
Yes part 9 or Jason goes to hell is a classy entry in the series.Jason's soul jumping from one body to the next might seem ridiculous but they have tried everything else.,2
"Well, I thought Friday the 13th part 5 was bad!? This is the worst ""Friday"" by far and it's only redeeming quality is the nice DVD release and the fact it opens the door for Freddy VS Jason! For that reason alone I rate it 1 1/2 stars!Unfortunately Freddy VS Jason was shelved for many years and was released after Jason X?! Which doesn't make any sense, so we have to pretend that Freddy VS Jason came out before Jason X to have this even begin to make sense.(I use the term loosely!) The only postive thing I can say about this film is that it's got a way too good DVD release and it makes Jason X and Freddy VS Jason look all that much better!I was really disappointed with this entry even though 'Jason Takes Manhattan' isn't much better! If you want to complete the Friday the 13th series, it should be seen as it does set up the superior sequel 'Freddy VS Jason'.",2
How could anyone think that Jason was dead. That killer in it was smart in saying he's not but what makes the world think he can stop Jason. I was really disappointed with this one even though my standards for Friday movies are extremely low. I really only watched this for the end part when Freddy's hand pulls Jason into hell and belive me it wasn't worth it one bit.Another horrible thing about this movie was it's cast. That fat diner owner was so stupid with the whole Vorhees Birger and Jason fries. When Jason came in there I was so happy when all of them were killed. This one was really disappointed when I saw this and it isn't even worht the two star rating I gave it.,2
"I have always been a fan of the Friday the 13th series. I'd seen each of the movies a dozen times, but had somehow missed this particular movie. I barely even remembered hearing about it.I finally got to see it a few days ago and, wow... I mean, I honestly gave this movie a chance. I really did. This installment into the series is what PART 3 was to the HALLOWEEN series. Jason is barely in the movie. When you do see him, his makeup job is so weak that he becomes more comical than imposing or frightening. Now, I love Kane Hodder as Jason, but the acting in this movie is absolutely bottom shelf. There are a few decent visual effects, yet there are more than enough cheesy effects to counter and totally eclipse the good.This is the 2nd ""mulligan"" of the series: along with part 5, fans will wish they could simply remove them from the series and forever forget them.",2
"Jason, the living, breathing essence of evil, is back for another fierce fling. Tracked down and blown to bits by a special FBI task force, everyone now assumes that he's finally dead. But everyone is wrong. Jason has been reborn with the ability to assume the identity of anyone he touches. The terrifying truth is that he could be anywhere. Or anybody.One of the weaker installments in the franchise. The one bright spot in the film is actor Steven Williams (who would later play the role of ""Mr. X"" in the series ""The X-Files""). His character is interesting, and he plays it with energy and comedic touches.",2
THIS MOVIE IS THE WORST OF THE SERIES. JASON IS ONLY IN 2 SCENES THE BEGINNING AND THE END. THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE MOVIE HE IS POSSESSING PEOPLE AND CONTROLLING THEM FROM INSIDE THEIR BODIES. THIS MOVIE BLOWS PART 5 IS BETTER AND TAT BLOWED TO 5 IS BETTER CUS THEY ACTUALLY HAD A JASON LOOK ALIKE AND U FIRST THINK ITS JASON. I GAVE THIS MOVIE 2 STARS CUS OF THE AMOUNT OF GORE IN IT.,2
"First off I LOVE THE ""FRIDAY THE 13th"" FILMS!!, but as a movie fan this is BY FAR the WORST ""Friday"" film off them all, turning one of the most popular slashers of all time into what looks like one of the ""ALIENS"" after bursting through a chest and then having him switching from body to body ala ""Invasion of the body snatchers"" has to be ONE OF THE WORST IDEAS IN MOVIE HISTORY!! About the only thing that was semi enjoyable in the film was the end and I wont spoil it for you guys that havent seen it. I gave it 2 stars, one because the movie is watchable and the other because im a fan of the series. If your a collector of the ""Friday"" films its a no-brainer to get it to complete your collection. If you're looking for a good horror flick...STAY AAWWAAYYYY!!!",2
"Now I know that horror flicks aren't supposed to make alot of sense, but there comes a point where leaving too much unexplained and unaccounted for detracts from the quality of the movie. And that is the case with this film--how does Jason have a long-lost sister? What is the Necronomicon doing in the house? What's with the bounty hunter and his special dagger? Not very well thought out.",2
I watched the special features of Jason goes to hell. They said this is the end of all Jason movies. Ya ok.... do they really think the way they ended it no one is going to think of a way for him to come out of hell. If Jason was able to come from hell to grab his hooky mask and laugh about it. I'm pretty sure that mean's he will or can come back from hell. But nice try on trying to end this movie. Which by the way is a big change out of all Jason movies. What is the big changes in this movie compared to all the others? Well Jason is able to kill living in different body's.,2
"this movie was almost as bad as ""Jason X"" (quite possibly the WORST sequel to come out of any movie ever - and ive seen major league 2: back to the minors).this movie forces you to sit through an hour and a half of boring ""weve-seen-this-before"" horror movie cliches only to find the best bit of the whole thing is the last 30 seconds.however, if youre a die-hard fan of the friday the 13th series (which means you should have seen this years ago) and actually had to pay to see Jason X, this movie is for you - but im sure youll agree with me.",2
What's wrong with the screen? It's too bright. They were REALLY struggling to keep FRIDAY13 alive by this point. So much so that Paramount gave up on it. It's their own fault for not making them better than they should have been. My Friday the 13th rewrites will be 10 times better I promise you that.,2
"I will have to admit, this film is pretty good but they stole their idea. The film ""The Hidden"" was just like this. Friday The 13TH Part 9: Jason Goes To Hell was a copied movie. The Hidden was a great movie. The Hiddden was made in 1987, Friday The 13th Part 9 was made in 1993 so you can tell the producer of Friday The 13TH stole their great idea. Friday The 13th Part 9 is alike to The Hidden because they have this killer that hops from body to body by spitting a snake alien thing into their mouth and then the one with the snake alien thing is the new killer. ...",2
"People that give this movie a good review,forget what the story is about.You can't follow the same storyline for 7 parts and then screw it up with Manhattan and this scifi bodysnatching garbage.Two stars for begining and ending and it's apart of the greatest horror legacy,so I do have it in my collection.",2
"when the movie had been started for like 30 minutes i started to get confused...i wasnt completely dissapointed though...it was an alright movie, its just so different than the other F13's...I wasnt expecting something like this...but the main question i thought about was ""why did the doctor eat jasons heart""?...I mean, thats just plain dumb n stupid n such...i didnt like the idea of them putting jason into other bodies..it was dumb..I could have made a WHOLE lot better F13 movie than that...Its like i said...This movie is not all THAT bad (its pretty bad though)...i wouldnt recommend renting it..",2
"This movie is a nonsensical barage of noise and gross-out ugliness. Why they bother to pretend that this is the same ""Jason"" as in the original Friday, I don't know. I guess they think the audience is pretty dumb. By 1993, it was apparent that 'they don't make 'em like they used to.' The 80s horror flicks were so much better, less loud, less obnoxious, and more fun. This is trash.",2
"Though I like th Friday The 13th series, this one STINKS!!!!!Jason is a little worm transfering from body to body. Jason is only in the beginning and the end. Though it stinks, A Nightmare On Elm Street's Freddy Krueger makes a special appearence at the end by sticking his right hand, ( The one with the claws ) out of the ground and pulls Jason's hockey mask to Hell with him. So, only if you are a die hard fan you should , if not, don't see it. You are wasting your money.",2
"Please understand that this is NOT the orange Michael W. Smith Worship CD translated directly onto a DVD. This DVD is a compilation of the Worship and Worship Again CDs. Make sure you research the songs contained in this DVD, so you will not be disappointed, as I was.",2
"This DVD is disappointing to say the least. From the moment Michael enters the arena through the crowd I feel like I'm watching carefully scripted theatre rather than worship to the King of Kings. The focus here is Michael W. Smith, ""Worship Artist"". Michael appears stiff and very conscious of the cameras, his movements choreographed. The direction is average, lacking inspiration and repetitive. The only moment I felt my spirit engage was during Awesome God. If you want a truly amazing worship experience on DVD I suggest you avoid this. You're better off buying Hillsong's ""Blessed"" or Christian City Church, Oxford Falls' new album ""Lift"".",2
I ordered the widescreen for my wife's birthday and received the full screen. The movie is good but I'm not happy about the error.,2
"If neither Sandra Bullock nor Hugh Grant (to a lesser extent) can save the thinnest and most damningly simple movie, then it's safe to say that it is indeed junked. Unlike one of the other Mark Lawrence movies featuring Bullock, 'Miss Congeniality,' Bullock doesn't get much of a chance to show off her screwball splendor. Instead, what we get from both leads is a tired effort at replaying what movie audiences love most about them, which is one joke too many and one too lame already. But, if all else fails in a screwball romance, you can at least be assured of eye candy with this pair.",2
"I gave it two stars and i was being kind. Simply because I saw ""the ring"" and gave it one star and did enjoy it more than that. But this movie is so predictable. Maybe its because I've seen this before. yes it was in ""you've got mail."" Two rich and professional people who in the begining dispise each other while one of them is in a relationship with another. About half way through the protagonist who's in the relationship miraculously drops the 'lover-we-never-see' and realizes how much she loves our other main character. But they save it all for the end with the big ""oh i've always felt this way kiss""Sadly predicatable and loaded with a lot of dry humor, this movie wasn't at all what I expected, it was worse. Sadly, Sandra's 'girl next door good looks' and Hugh's quick oneliners weren't enough to rescue this movie from its date with ...[removed store name].",2
"Sandra Bullock tries the old, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" routine for this movie. This movie was not funny at all. Even with comedian, Robert Klein in a supporting role, it doesn't take off. Hugh Grant is wasted in his role. Overall, this is a dud.",2
"TWO WEEKS NOTICE was a cute film but missed the mark unlike its predecessor Maid In Manhattan which was more real and entertaining. Sandra Bullock (Miss Congeniality, Force Of Nature) produced this film as well as stars in it. Her performance although I am sure is honest seemed a little held back playing the Harvard Lawyer fighting for the down-and-under trod.While the other side of the coin, there is the rich millionaire played by Hugh Grant (Nine Months, Notting Hill) was a more outgoing, non-caring and flamboyant wisp that almost didn't match to well with Sandra.It ran a little slow and seemed much more predictable toward the end. Written and directed by Marc Lawrence (Miss Congeniality, Force Of Nature) the movie seemed very slow in pace. Robert Klein (Primary Colors, One Fine Day) gives a standout performance as Sandra's father that is worth noting.This is a good movie for the video and DVD - but theatrically it was a little disappointing. (12-31-02)",2
"Being a fan of both Miss. Sandra Bullock and Mr. Hugh Grant I looked forward to what I felt would be a fun movie, unfortunately I was to be quite disappointed.Miss Bullock's character lacked the manic energy she has frequently displayed and that this story badly needed. Her character, Lucy Kelson, had a great deal of potential, which a lackluster performance did not deliver.Mr. Grant's performance was better, but not markedly so. The `one liners' he delivered had little punch and even less humor. The chemistry between the two main characters, necessary in this type film, just didn't seem to be there.The one bright spot was Miss. Alicia Witt, as June Carter, a sort of rival to Miss Bullock's character for the affections of Mr. Grant. Her performance had energy, humor, the vulnerability of youth and at the same time the sense that she was potentially a predator manipulating the situation for personal gain.Bottom line: Even the best miss on occasion and this is one such occasion.",2
"""Two Weeks Notice"" stars two appealing people, but they have no chemistry. My dog and cat have more chemistry. Why would a lawyer (Sandra Bullock) want to work for a conceited billionaire (Hugh Grant)? Greed is a bad thing. Falling in love after countless annoying incidents just makes this movie another routine POS. There was one scene where they were playing mixed doubles in tennis and I was truly ashamed with their athleticism. I could've probably beat all of them with my hand tied behind my back because I'm the king of handicap matches. Oh well. This movie really doesn't grab your attention and makes you wish you spent your money on something with substance, like a twinkie.",2
"Let's be honest this is as [weak] a comedy as you can imagine but having said that, Hugh Grant is funny, even with this script and Sandra Bullock is cute. I would never recommend you actually buy this but a rental on an evening when you IQ are asleep and there is nothing else on, then it is okay.",2
but I don't like Sandra doing her insane bouncing ball impersonation. seen her doing it in several movies and it really gets on my nerve.,2
"Love the movie, but beware of this DVD. 3 times I've ordered it from Amazon (twice in a Slipcase and once in a Keepcase, and all 3 DVD's skipped, the video broke up, scenes kept repeating, etc... And yes, I used the Memorex CD cleaner on the DVD player without any change, and no, none of my numerous other commercially purchased DVD's demonstrate this problem. Two Weeks Notice is the ONLY one. So my suggestion is to stick to the VCR version.",2
"OK, this review is going to be fairly short. I have to say that this movie could have been great, but unfortunately falls flat at the end. The first half of this movie is great, Hugh Grant is hilarious and Sandra Bullock manages to be cute and intelligent at the same time, and these characters are completely believable. Grant has a line where he says ""My life is a lot like Monopoly"" ( which had me rolling ) and sadly the movie is a lot like Monopoly, in that it is a 'board' game and I found myself very 'bored' in the last half of the movie.This movie is hilarious enough in the first half that I watch just that part then turn it off, because I know what is coming. The last act has them coming together and confessing their love for each other, and at that point it feels completely rushed and unbelievable, like this is the end, so they love each other, ummm, roll credits. I recommend the first half highly, then just skip the rest.",2
"Sometimes a bubblegum movie is old bubblegum, tired and chewy and not very sweet. This movie has all the pieces but doesn't have any zing to it, any purpose. They go back and forth a little bit but they never truly convinced me that they were in love or their love was in danger. Alicia Witt, a superb actress didn't really have much to do in thsi film and Hugh Grant's bumbling charm boy routine is wearing thin.I'm not sure about Bullock, she's filling a niche I'm sure. Doing films that appeal to her, that she gets paid a lot for, that help employ a lot of people. But I'm not qute sure if she's developing further along as an actress, if she's willing to take a risk and do something edgey or different or challenging. She just seems to be the best at the romantic comedy pairings movie of the season. Hopefully she'll start getting better choices.",2
"Fresh of watching ""About A Boy"" I felt like Hugh Grant could do no wrong, so despite less than stellar reviews I decided give ""Two Weeks Notice"" a shot, which was a mistake. While there are some comedic moments, this a romantic comedy and Bullock and Grant have NO chemistry. In most of the scenes they seem only mildly aware of eachother mostly focusing on thier actions. As a result, I never felt like they should be together. Further, the plot seems to jump around. Right after getting hired, the plot leapfrogs to weeks later where Grant and Bullock are now supposed to be chumy, but I never felt it. THey seem to be tired of eachother and their action forced by the plot's simple-minded purpose. After his great romantic comedies of the 1990s, this a huge step down for Grant and even for Bullock, who mostly makes bad movies anyway. This is not worth your time because it clearly wasn't even worth the actors full attention.",2
"Hugh Grant does his enjoyable act to perfection in this movie but it is so lacking in story that it's rendered mind-numbing syrup even by romantic comedy standards. The schlock political message they attempt is embarrasing even to liberals.And let's face it, Sandra Bullock is just not a screen beauty, cute maybe, but that nasal voice that not will carry a movie.",2
"By activating the ""Two Bleeps Notice"" function in Special Features, you can access the movie outtakes when a small pink heart appears on the screen. If you don't want to have to watch the entire movie, here are the locations of each heart. I think I found them all. These are listed by hour:minute:second. 18:32, 20:04, 23:38, 24:13, 26:38, 28:14, 33:02, 37:28, 41:36, 47:16, 57:50, 1:13:01, 1:24:29.The extras on the DVD are of the usual fare, but not outstanding. The commentary is somewhat interesting, with Sanda and Hugh bantering about. The movie itself is somewhat forgettable, but is an enjoyable little film. I agree with another reviewer who said that it's like iceberg lettuce: not really great for you, but certainly not bad for you either, and you'll forget all about it an hour after it's over.",2
"Nothing worth seeing-- Grant has made some classics in this genre (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, Bridget Jones's Diary)-- but ""Two Weeks Notice"" is not a classic. It isn't even an admirable effort. It is clear he enjoyed working with Sandra Bullock offscreen, but they share little onscreen chemistry. Bullock continues her title as the ""poor man's Julia Roberts"" -- it's not a harmful film-- it's just not very good.",2
Same story we've seen many times before. You know whats going to happen just by seeing the preview. Grant is great and charming. Bullock is her same old clumsy character. Supporting cast provides laughs as well. All right if you have nothing better to see.,2
"I've always been a big fan of Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock and I was really looking forward to seeing the two of them together. I sincerely wanted to enjoy myself, but the one thing you heard ALL the critics agree upon about this film turned out to be absolutely true-- It's about as ordinary and unoriginal as a romantic comedy can be. The conflicting question among all the critics was this: Were Bullock and Grant able to turn a rather dull movie into something good? I didn't think so unfortunately. Heck, I don't even think the pairing of Superman and Wonder Woman could have saved this film. It certainly doesn't compare well to Grants previous picture, ABOUT A BOY.My recommendation is not to waste your money on this movie unless you're a fan of these two actors... My final review is two and a half stars... Just too average and not many laughs.",2
"Sandra Bulluck (who is my favorite actress, by the way) never looked good in this movie and the chemistry between her and Hugh Grant was missing. Neither her character nor Hugh's was particularly like-able and the ending was, of course, predictable, but lacking in real emotion. Wait for cable.",2
"This water dispenser works just fine and my dogs have no problem drinking from it. I have a problem with cleaning it, however. I keep it outside and in the summer months, it will develop a green mold or algae inside the jug and also in the bowl. Since there is only the small narrow spout for an opening, there is no way to get any kind of brush in there to clean it. I ended up having to soak it in bleach water to remove the green stuff inside.",2
"I started off using this as the primary water dish for my pets, however within a very short amount of time, I'd have to dump out all the water to clean it because a nasty, clear slime would start growing in the dish-YUCK!I decided to start using a pet water fountain as their primary water source, because it's constantly moving and there's a filter, it stays clean a bit longer.However, this is great for cats, if you're away on vacation. But, because of the slime factor, I don't like to use this unless I have to.",2
"This waterer is a great concept, but does have some drawbacks. For starters, one of my dogs is scared to death of it and wont come near it because when the water level in the bowl gets low it gurgles just like a water cooler at work. The first time it happened she was drinking out of it and it freaked her out and now wont go near it. The other dog is just fine with it, but then again he's deaf, so the gurgle doesn't bother him. lol. The other issue i had with this is just like all water bowls, it gets dirty. so you still have to clean it as often as you would any other water bowl, but it's a bit more cumbersome having to take the big jug off, clean the bowl and but the jug back on. So, if your dog isn't afraid of the noise it makes and you don't mind the extra hassle cleaning it, it's great. Otherwise, just get a large bowl; that's what i ended up having to do.",2
"While it functions great as a pet waterer, the Microban does not work very well. We have to clean it every time we fill it (used with dogs). It is only a few months old and will get green over several days. We contacted the company and got virtually no support--just a note that we may need to clean it occasionally. No kidding. That's what we told them. So good waterer, terrible customer support, and does not stay clean very well.",2
"As others have noted, this system works exceedingly well up until the time that the bottle develops a crack -- & make no mistake, the plastic used for the bottle is so brittle that it will eventually crack if it is even slightly mishandled. The ""antibacterial"" aspect could be better as well. I have had some success in using RTV to seal cracks, but eventually you're going to have to replace the unit.",2
"Brand new and bottom broke. very expensive as well. Too bad I cannot send back. I had it for alot of animals outside. My chicken coop caught winter electrical fire, so bottle got burnt anyway.",2
"I bought the LeBistro Portion Control Feeder and for the first 12 feeding times at breakfast and lunch it worked like a champ. Then it stopped delivering meals. Fortunately I was aware of it - I bought it for when we went away for weekends, but wanted to be sure the cat wouldn't starve while we were gone so set it up to feed. The Waterer I bought is fine. It's just a little water cooler. I wish it were a little more solid though.Back to the Feeder - I had to reset the whole thing twice before it worked. I had the right times and portions but just didn't drop the food. I'm going to give it another week or so before I ask to have it replaced.When it works it's great - good design for the cost. Pretty easy to set up.But intermittent behavior defeats the purpose of being able to leave with confidence.",2
"I used this waterer for several months. I had always rinsed it out with fresh water before refilling it, and scrubbed the bottom part. Within 2 days, the bottom part would always start growing an orange slime on it, and I smelled the plastic water-holder part, and it smells like algae (although none is visible). I feel awful for using this product for my cat, and have switched to a regular bowl that I can thoroughly clean daily. I am only keeping the automatic water dish in the event I'm away a day or two. Other than that, DO NOT USE FOR DAILY WATER.",2
"My new cat 4 mo. old could see bottom of spout-nipple-water exit point and kept reaching in to pull on it,leading too a huge mess as it then pawed at the water in the bowl as i guess it was it the way.digging might better explain as it threw the water out of the tray/pan onto the floor as fast as it could (yes it is now funny).Only saying so because last one only had a small hole for water to come out of into pool/drinking area.Only needed a new bottle but was just as cheap to get new assembly.re-inventing the wheel in this case did not work with my cat who has now become bored with it and finally just drinks out of it.hope this helps.",2
"This album was originally released in 1968, when Regis was Joey Bishop's sidekick. It was Regis's only commercially released album, although he later recorded some albums that he released on his own. Regis had an okay singing voice, but it was certainly nothing special. Also, his style was hopelessly outdated by 1968. The arrangements of these standards are incredibly corny, too. But a few of these songs are good for a laugh. The highlight of the album is the end of ""Toot, Toot, Tootsie/Baby Face"", where Regis yells out ""Sock it to, 'em, Tootsie!"". Now, that's (unintentional) comedy!",2
As much as I love the show - I find the price of this DVD collection to be insane!,2
I wasn't able to give the actual box for the dvd as part of the gift because the top was ripped off. The status was that it was just like new. This is not just like new if the box is broken. Otherwise the dvds look great and not scratched.,2
"so far, still watching the first season. But can tell you that by only watching the first show i would give the season a 2. the first show of any season should grab your attention, and they do that but they just dont do a very good job at keeping it. In the first show, theres death, closet ""hook ups"", gay soft core love scenes and just plain drama, wonder what the rest of the shows are going to be like. If you are into the slow paced ironic drama then this show is for you.",2
"This isn't as much a review as much a question. Are they releasing Season 1 again next month but not on BluRay, why???",2
"Based on the other reviews, I am in the minority. This series just didn't do anything for me. I never got into the characters or even felt like i couldn't wait for the next episode. I don't know what it was, it was just boring. I never watched past the first season so i don't know if it got better or what but there is just better shows out there.",2
"This book gives good coverage of Oracle's JDBC implementation. That is about as far as it goes. This is just too close to being documentation. When purchasing books on a specific technology, I am looking for the author's insight. Specific things the author learned while working with it. Give me best practices, suggestions, things to avoid, etc. Tell me what I won't learn from Oracle's docs, don't just rewrite them.",2
"A look at the DVD cover conveys a message to the red blooded male that when seeing this movie you will be seeing some skin. If that's all you're looking for then you'll give it a higher rating than I have. I found disappointment as the story had potential but hindered itself by taking avenues from reality to far fetched situations without needing to. There is some suspense, and enough skin to keep it away from the kids, but overall it missed it's potential.",2
"Aside from anything else that is good or bad, routine or entertaining about this film, I can't be the only one who was completely unable to get past the fact that, in the big murder scene, both the hero and the victim act more stupefyingly idiotic than any characters in the lowest-grade teen slasher ever made.",2
"Because I KNOW you didn't see any amazing acting, incredible plot twists or X-rated sex scenes in Body Double. This film is watchable if nothing else is on; I'll give it that. But ""gripping?"" ""DePalma's masterpiece?"" ""a classic?"" Only if you took a LOT of drugs before you saw it. It's typical DePalma; in other words, a Hitchcock ripoff he manages to make a few notches above putrid.",2
There's much better Heep Compilations ('Running all night with the lion'... Please!!!) Don't waste your money.,2
This is a good classic rock cd with the exception that stealin one of their best songs is not on this or their greatest hits. The best song on here is Easy Livin so this is a cd only for a die hard Uriah Heep fan.,2
"With the exception of the catchy ""Easy Livin'"" I found this to be an unmemorable compilation of rock songs.",2
"The author is obviously a highly skilled pilot and has extensive experience. His recounting of the progress in the airline industry is very interesting. I bought the book expecting to read about progress in dealing with the problems encountered in adapting new technology and adjusting to the obviously over crowded skies. While the author states (over and over) that both are very real problems, he does not offer much in terms of what is being done to address the pilot's ever expanding workload. He seems merely intent on convincing the reader that the industry and the FAA are out to get the pilot. This book is not so much a study of human factors as a pilot's complaints about an industry that probably somehow just became something he no longer cared to be a part of.",2
"I'll echo some of the other reviews on here: the navigation is ridiculous, as is the ""easter egg"" hunt. With most DVD players ability to directly access any tracks, easter eggs aren't cool anymore. And one of my favorite videos ""A View To A Kill"" got the opening Bond gunbarrel and the beginning of the song chopped off (I'll assume it's due to licensing issues). FYI, it's not much better on the AVTAK movie DVD either: there, the video is unedited but it's cropped at the black bars so the floating cameras get cropped as well, plus it's worse quality than the Greatest version.For a band that single-handedly revolutionized the music video world and put MTV on the map, this is a shameful and appalling DVD. Hopefully there will be definitive DVD in the future that will include My Own Way, Careless Memories, and all the other ones that got left out, not to mention proper remastering and a better interface and package design. Hope springs eternal.",2
"THIS IS THE MOST UNDERATTED ALBUM IN PRIORITY RECORDS HEYDAYS. I CAN'T FIND ANY OTHER MUSIC BY THEM EXCEPT 1 OTHER SONG ON A COMP. CD THAT IS MORE THAN TEN YEARS OLD. IF ANYONE KNOWS WHERE I CAN FIND SOME MORE MUSIC BY THESE GUYS LET ME KNOW. HASTA, AND DRINK OLD ENGLISH",3

HDD Enclosures are always confusing as there are so many available in the market with so different ways of connecting peripheral/auxiliary devices. I went through a large list of HDD Enclosures and after couple of days purchased this item - waited for couple of days only to find out that this enclosure does not fit my internal hard disk. The board had some soldering blemishes but never had a chance to test the connectivity. The build looks pretty ok and it was a great ide to include the screw driver as part of the package - It was really helpful. Be sure of what Hard disks you are using - SATA is common these days. I ended up buying a SATA to USB cable that served the purpose of transferring data from my old hard disk to a newer one. This product may be good for the price advertised but ensure that this one serves the purpose. This would fit only HDD of laptops cos its 2.5inch and would not work with the bigger solid state drives - the ones which are normally used for desktop,3
"The device works, but you have to be careful with it. The IDE connection is not very deep and doesn't seem to be reliable. On the top of that, IDE connection is the only thing that hold the drive inside the case. While I am moving around with enclosure, I can hear the hard drive rattling inside.The Enclosure is OK for the stationary setup, but would not work for any mobile tasks.",3
This product is not for you if your going to use this as you primary portable hard dive. The only use for this enclosure is to retrieve data from another HDD.The solder joints are weak and look like their about to break.This product is not going to last very long so get a this is not for you if your going use it long term.,3
"Apparently, not all 2.5"" laptop drives are the same, or perhaps what i have isn't exactly a 2.5"" drive (IBM Travelstar, DCXA-210000, out of an old Dell laptop(?)). It didn't fit in the aluminum case... real close, but no cigar. Maybe if this drive had ever so slightly rounded edges along it's length it would fit.Fortunately, this is acceptable for my needs. It electronically edge-connected to my drive & provides the USB2.0 interface, but i do have to leave the drive out of the case, naked / exposed. O-well. 'Works.Karl*----->",3
"First things first, this enclosure is not blue, as listed. It is silver, and looks very similar to my other enclosure, which causes me some confusion, and is why I bought (or attempted to) a blue one.Otherwise, it works fairly well. Can get a little hot since it lacks fans, but keep it off of any insulating surface and it's fine.",3
"it took me a few extra minutes to plug in my drive and the usb cable came with the drive didn't work at first, but I figure out that problem and now it works great. Quiet, fast and slim.The vendor sent me a replacement usb cable no extra charge.Thx.",3
"As an enclosure, it seems to work fine. I knew it was cheap; we'll see how it fares over a period of time.My only quibble is the cable. I don't mind the Y-cable for use with computers that need the extra connection for power. It's the fact that the cable is a nonstandard USB A-A. Almost every other USB drive is A-B or A-mini B. Why does this matter? Because if you lose the cable, it'll be a hassle to replace it. As a consultant I have a lot of external drives, and don't want to worry about keeping specific cables with specific drives.",3
"Well, i have had it for a while and it was working. But then my computer suddenly stopped realizing it was even plugged in. So i tried another computer, and then my laptop, but nothing. I think it may be the driver, but I am just warning you people that you need to be careful.",3
"This drive works as advertised, my issue comes from the fact that the connector on the drive is a USB A connector. This makes things a little tough if you lose the cable - because it isn't easily replaced with either a mini or micro USB end, or the standard USB B connector. I doubt I'll get another one - though once connected it did work as expected.",3
"Like the title says, it does what it needs to and nothing more. I had to et one of these to do a data recovery from my brothers laptop.The case itself is well designed accept for the back plastic cover. It will take some jimmying to get it back on once the harddrive is installed in it. BUT YOU CAN DO IT.Also, don't loose the original usb cable. Its not proprietary but its a cross-over USB.Performs as expected and costs almost nothing compared to the alternatives I've seen in the past",3
"Works fine with Windows XP but unfortunately I bought this to access data on my old drive from a computer using Windows 7. Windows 7 says the drive is invalid and only give me an option to format it. Odd too since the data on the drive was all created in Windows 7. I have not yet tried that because I wanted to pull some data off of it first. I had to connect it to my work computer that uses Windows XP and share over the network to pull data.On a side note: this comes with a USB cord that has three plugs and no instructions at all on which one goes to enclosure, which one is supposed to plug in or if it even matters. One of the plugs is longer and thicker my guess is that one is for USB ports that are further away from where you want to put the drive but then I don't know since there are NO INSTRUCTIONS.",3
It has teenie-tiny phillips screws to hold in the top. Had to stuff some folded paper down inside because the case is longer than my HD and it kept sliding back and forth. The did supply a little phillips driver for those screws but the head of the supplied driver was way too big for the screws. What a joke. It worked once mounted and modified but it should have some foam or something to account for different length HDs and some click-in type of mounting instead of screws like those that are in your glasses. These screws are going to get lost and screw into plastic directly so eventually will strip out its socket. It does have a nice slip-in case and sleek color.,3
"This product was easy to set up and install. With a DVD it has pretty good surround sound and appears to be well balanced. The wireless rear speakers work well.

"This book provides examples of how to do certain special effects.It was definitely more of a ""tips and tricks"" book than it was a learning resource.

Most photoshop gurus will just scoff at this book, and most newbies will walk away amazed, but no smarter about photoshop than before they read it.The latter portions of the book was nothing more than a summary of the different photoshop filters found in commercial filter packages. I question why thoese filters were even in the book; it seemed like advertising that does not benefit the readers.",3
"I absolutely loved the anime of Cowboy Bebop. This book is set in the same universe with the same characters. Their stories, however, have changed. The way we meet Ed, Faye, Ein, and the history of Spike and Jet are different based on the author's take on the characters. Some might not like this, but I like the new twist on their relationships. Plus the author has added a whole new badguy! Since the TV series is over, it is also like getting all new Bebop stories. I haven't read the rest in this manga series so I don't know how they continue, but if you are dying for more Spike and don't mind the alternate reality, I highly recommend the book!If you don't want the stories to change, consider picking up the Cowboy Bebop series by Hajime Yadate and Yutaka Nanten, ISBN#1931514917, simply called Cowboy Bebop Book 1 etc. These are more like continuing adventures that take place in between what would have been a TV episode.",3

Production is not as great as I would have thought, but there are some cuts (at least a few from black c) that dont sound too rapmaster keyboard-drum machine style. I liked the title track w/ big mack. taydatay/big mac collabo album would be good. as i said, the lyrics overshadow the production- sean t (he did this title track), ric roc (its hard 2 b-legit) have the best in the bay right now..",3
"I have to say..I just started using this series and thus far, the written portion is great! But how could I have known it required a very expensive CD? I sure wish that part had been stated before I ordered this series.",3
"Offutt's strength is his prose and characterization, but his narrative is a little off here. A shame really, because his first memoir was solid all around. He himself admits to not knowing what the Holocaust story has to do with his own return to Kentucky and, quite frankly, neither do I. It seemed thrown in as maudlin filler and was blatantly incongruous.The ending seemed rushed too. ""I am saying good-bye"" and ""I want to stay. I am ready to leave."" I know he can do better and the rest of the book proves that he can do better.Still though, there are some stylistic gems here. Offutt uses words and characters wonderfully. You'll love them and understand them. He's a very solid writer and students learning to write creatively can learn a lot from his craft--overtly and subtly.Worth a read.",3
"Three stars may be generous for the game. There is really only one way to consistently score: take the ball right to the hoop while using the ""juke"" moves. Short range jump shots don't work. Post-up game: forget it. Anything resembling a real basketball game: forget it. But if you do take the ball to the hoop and use the juke moves and you have one of the star players it is unstoppable. Play LeBron: he'llo score every time. If you like a pure arcade-style game then you might like this one.",3
"I heard Neil say in an interview many years ago that he was going to write a book someday, eight years later I was excited to finally find this book. If you're looking to read a book about Neil the drummer or Neil the musician, you will be sadly dissipointed. If you want to learn about his passion and desire read this book. If your not a cyclist you might not find this book is for you.",3
"Barbarian was a better film, a feast for the eyes, great acting etc, but Destroyer is more humorous and is worth watching for the Princess alone! A bit corny especially in the Wizard scene but all in all a good fantasy film",3
"Conan the Barbarian is back in CONAN THE DESTROYER, 1984 sequel. Without going into a long review, if you liked the first one, rent this one- but chances are you won't be pleased. CONAN THE DESTROYER (1984) Rated: PG (Fantasy Barbarian Violence) 2 1/2 stars out of 5.",3
"Among Arnold's early movies, this one stands out for the eclectic supporting cast. His early movies were remarkedly free of any acting on his part; I suspect he was still learning English then. But one way to make him look better is to hire nonactors, or miscast semiactors. Enter Wilt and Grace. (Later, Richard Dawson). This is as much a collectible as Terminator 2.",3
"""Conan the Destroyer "", this disappointing sequel to the entertaining and well made ""Conan the Barbarian"" is an example of what happens when studios attempt to broaden the appeal of a movie for younger audiences. This movie tries to inject more slapstick humor and includes ""big name"" stars (Grace Jones and Wilt Chamberlain), while sacrificing much of the story line, effective characters, and raw action that made the first movie so watchable. The special effects were also weaker and often seemed out of place, making this a real step backwards.If it wasn't for ""Arni"", it wouldn't be worth the price of the DVD. Recommended only for die hard Conan and ""Arni"" fans.",3
"After the succesful Conan The Barbarian the inevitable sequel took part 2 years after the first.This time Conan the Cimmerian(Schwarzenegger) must find with the help of a virgin princess a jewel that leads to the horn of a god Dagoth which a evil queen(Douglas) needs to give to their kingdom all the power of the world.Followed by the sorcerer of the first film(Mako) by a cure thief(Lester) and a agile warrior(Jones) they must face all the dangers of such a risky mission.With dign special and visual effects and the final monster made by the creator of ET the film has a whole dign production better than italian imitations(Ator) or cheesy and camp productions(Red Sonja,Barbarian Queen) and at least is entertaining and pleased to watch.",3
"The last batman movie was great, this was plain ordinary. Overrated and far too generously reviewed.",3
"this blu ray its anything you would expect i recomended and people should buy the box set too, thnkx e",3
"Had eagerly awaited this one. Great movie, but the image quality was in no way up to BluRay standards. Not having seen it in the theater, I don't know whether this was by design.That said... Oscar-worthy.",3
"Everybody knows the movie is fantastic, and I'm sure the transfer to blu-ray is equally as impressive, but I received this product with a giant puncture mark through the case. There was no damage to the box, so I assume it had to be due to how the movie was handled in the warehouse. It literally looks like somebody attacked it with a screwdriver. Luckily it didn't damage the disks, but regardless it's still annoying.",3
I absolutely love this movie. I hate paying $25 for blu ray discs though as even with my top notch equipment it's just not that much better. I already have two versions of the dvd.. yeah i like it that much and wanted the blu ray basically cause the price was right. However i was disappointed as when i got it there was a golf ball type divet in the blu ray which wouldn't allow it to play. I unfortunately had to return it. I am giving this item a 3 star for midway though because i received fast service and it was extremely easy to return at no cost to me.So yes quality control sucked that this got out as it clearly couldn't play for anyone but Amazon customer service support was top notch for returns.,3
"I wasnt planning on watching this movie but decided to last minute. I saw it on the huge screen at IMAX.. special effects and action was great.. heath ledger was fantastic in the role as the Joker.. i had only seen him in romance and drama roles before this, but he really suprised me with this one. He really went out leaving his mark.If you're not a fan of his, or of the Batman series, you might not become a fan from watching this movie, but i do recommend giving it a chance at least. Its a pretty good storyline and even a bit scary towards the end.. i only bought the dvd for a friend, but i wouldnt mind watching it again.Definately watch it if you're a Heath Ledger fan though.. he was awesome in his role and you will love him in this one.",3
"This was a solid movie, but way too long. It was as if they kept putting in another scheme for the Joker to pull off...then another...then another. Why? They could have cut 30 minutes from the movie easily.I have to say that I was expecting much more from Heath. While his performance was certainly solid, it was by no means the oscar winning portrayal I was hoping to see. And for him to have said that the role was so disturbing that it was causing insomnia and a lot of his problems--he clearly had some emotional issues then, because the Joker was actually a lot more tame that I thought he was going to be. All in all a solid movie, but it was too long and over-hyped.",3
When i hit the play button i watched so horrible video quality for a release that this one..i felt ripped off.The Sound- The sound is very clear and crispy. No hiss sound or cracking sound.Extras- well another let down here.,3
"My star rating is for the BluRay, not the film itself.As much as I love this movie (and I do love this movie), I had to settle for the standard DVD version because of the sudden aspect ratio changes for the IMAX footage. I found this amazingly distracting and it constantly kept throwing me out of the movie. Hopefully someday they'll release another BluRay version that has the option to disable the IMAX ratio switch and I'll be able to upgrade, but until then I must make do with 480p when I watch this wonderful film. It's a shame, too, because other than the annoying ratio swapping the film looks amazing on BD.",3
that must have been the studios motto when they made the standard dvd. This has to be the worst transfer I have seen in modern film making. I am absolutely perplexed why this film was not made in DTS except as others have pointed out that perhaps they are trying to push Blu Ray.Its a great film ( I saw it three times in IMAX) but this dvd is a disappointment. We deserved better.,3
"Everyone knows about the movies that are very well written, casted, and directed. They are awarded and phrased films we've placed on our movie shelves for good looks and not show (There Will Be Blood, No Country For Old Men, Atonement, Titanic, Broke back Mountain, Batman Returns, may i continue...) . I have added The Dark Knight to the movie I must own, because it was great (and Heath Ledger died before it's release and has made it history), but i will never suffer through the three hours of talk talk talk and batman's boring humiliation AGAIN!!! EVER!",3
"Batman tries to destroy organized crime in Gotham. The Joker is the adversary here in this sequel to Batman Begins. It was one of the top two highest grossing films ever along with Spider Man 3. Comic fan or not, Batman has his origins in the 1930s with Detective Comics, hence the DC company. Nightwing was the original Robin. The secind Robin was killed by The Joker in A Death in the Family. In the Knightfall, Knightquest and Knightsend series in the 90s, Batman is crippled by a new villain named Bane. His latest protege Azrael dones an upgraded costume in his sit in as Batman. In Zero Hour Nightwing regrets Batman didn't take him as the fill in. They brought in Batgirl in like 1989.",3
"I really enjoyed Batman Begins and looked forward to this movie, but I was disappointed. The story line is great, the acting superb, but it is extremely dark and violent. I think it could all have been done as effectively without all the gratuitous ugliness. The depiction of the prosecutor after his burns was not believable and better suited to a horror movie. A very good concept taken too far.",3
"The acting was great!!! The movie, though, was very dark. I like a little more light!! Heath Ledger will be missed!!!!!!",3
"Apart from the mask, there isn't that much special about this limited edition. No audio commentary is my big complaint. However, the Batman Unmasked featurette is an unexpected pleasure, as it psychoanalyzes Batman in all his incarnations. I suspect there's another limited edition coming with more bells and whistles. Me, I bought this because I loved the movie and this set cost as much as the regular two-DVD edition.",3
"I wil not get into a review of the film itself, other than to say its an outstanding movie...far transending the genre into a truly imaginative frightening film. The DVD on the other hand is insultingly bad. Poor resolution...artifacts...edge enhancement....lots of compression...poor black levels...etc. Its dvds like this that make some believe that studios, especially Warrner Brothers are intentionaly degrading the potental quality on standard DVD to help push Blu Ray. Until this dvd I thought that was some paranoid delusion on the part of some film fans, but this DVD is so shoddy ...especially for such a film, that I can almost believe that they may be on to something. Shame on Warner Brothers for this truly sub standard DVD. I am a television producer, so I know what a DVD can and should look like...and this is NOT it!!!",3
"Yes, Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is an excellent film without question. BUT, shame on Warner Bros. for releasing such a not-so-special 2disk special edition for it's initial release onto DVD. NO INTERVIEWS WITH HEATH LEDGER? Or most of the cast and crew for that matter. Instead you get a scant pathetic 2 ""making off"" tiny featurettes, 6 lame episodes of ""Gotham Tonight"" the seperated IMAX scenes, and some yawn trailers and photo galleries. They're obviously saving the real good stuff for next year's release after Ledger's won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his amazing portrayal of the Joker.So yes, the film rocks, this release sucks though, so Please...be Patient.",3
"This movie simply had too many holes in the plot and was far too drawn out to earn the title of best movie in the current Batman series. Batman Begins was a much more compelling, well written, and far better film in my opinion.",3
"The Bottom Line:The Dark Knight, despite being one of the best reviewed films of 2009, does not measure up to the accolades bestowed upon it or to its prequel Batman Begins; it's poorly-plotted (the ending *actually* hinges on a magical technology that allows Batman to see what everyone in the city is doing), severely overlong at 150 minutes, inconsistent with its characters (Harvey Dent is supposed to be enraged at the death of his fiancÃ©e, yet he teams up with her murderer) and just not the gem that it is made out to be.2.5/4",3
"I'm so disapointed in this movie.I'm glad I waited for ""The Dark Knight""to come on HBO instead of paying for the DVD.Heath Ledger is great,He really is the Joker,but TOO much Tongue.A couple of times is alright,but every scene !Christian Bale is horrible.He sounds like Puddy on Seinfield.I can't believe he was cast to play Batman.""The Dark Knight""is not a film I want to watch again.",3
"There's lots of action in ""The Dark Knight"". The Joker (Heath Ledger) stole the show. He played the character perfectly! Blu-ray quality is outstanding, and the audio is awesome. I didn't like the fact that the scenes switched from the Imax view to the widescreen with black bars. This took away from the movie in my opinion. Good special features. Buy the DVD for Heath Ledger's acting and the good blu-ray video and audio. The movie is over-rated.",3
"The Dark Knight starring Christian Bale is pretty exciting but the hype doesn't live up to my chargin. Heath Ledger is absolutely brilliant as The Joker, he is muchly missed but he's not the one who steals this movie, Aaron Eckhart is a pleasant surprise! I'm glad Katie Holmes didn't reprise her role as Rachel, Maggie Gyllenhaal is such a better actress by far. The opening scene is probably the best sequence, the ending is a bit of a letdown. Entertaining action flick but has its flaws.",3
"Don't get me wrong on the 3 star rating, I love this movie. The reason I knocked it down is because the special edition version is a total waste of money. I could never have imagined such a total lack of effort for such a major movie as this when it comes to special features. Hell, there isn't even a director's commentary on the single disk version, so what do you think you're getting on the second disk. Yes, the two little documentaries are interesting, but are not worth the extra money. I am extremely disappointed in whoever put this thing together, my copy of Dr. Strangelove from the 1960s has more special features than this, what were they thinking.",3
"At one point in the movie, nearing the end, I was saying to myself, ""My God! How much longer can this go on! What more can they do!""As a showcase for special effects and especially Heath Ledger's amazing performance, this movie is a success.More from Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman would have been nice, as would more of a story.It's almost like they took an hour of the Joker's life and bisected it into seconds. Senseless violence, on and on...",3
"I saw the Dark Knight without seeing Batman Begins simply because I was curious and I needed something. I was blown out of my movie-seeing brain! At the urge of the man (who wasn't present when Dark Knight came out) we saw Dark Knight Rises. It was NOT THAT GREAT. If I had to tell someone to only see one, I'd say see Dark Knight because it is non-stop suspense and intensity with so many twists and unpredictable spins you're still thinking about it. The Dark Knight Rises is predictable, looooooooong, and leaves so many open ends Christopher Nolan is lying through his 5 layers of fat that this ""trilogy"" is over. You cannot end this on a weak note. See Dark Knight. If you choose to be fulfilled, see Batman Begins, Dark Knight Rises (not cuz it's better, cuz you need the history), then Dark Knight. Don't save this til last, but save the 3 hrs if you plan on it. It's really not the best",3
I barely remember watching this. Weak story and weak performances. In the comics Batman and Bruce Wayne were big hulking guys. That helped with my suspension of disbelief. Making these guys heart throbby is obviously the idea of Hollywood suits. It sometimes works in favor of their bottom line but not this time.,3
Made poorly out of flexible plastic. overpriced. Wish it was of better quality.Movie rocks though!,3
"I saw this film on an airplane on my laptop because it had been sitting on the hard drive. The graphics were very good, the acting was decent, the action was unbelievable and the rubble used was of both high in quality and quantity. This is the ideal films for people who love blockbusters, super hero films and strong villains. I don't think there is anything different here in terms of the story line.Christian Bale acted well, the late Heath Ledger was good too but overall the film doesn't have enough grey to intrigue one beyond the 153 minutes it runs for. I'm not into superhero films and think this is about as good as they get. To me, Nolan's masterpiece was The Prestige.",3
I liked Batman begins much better then this movie. I thought Dark Night was way too dark of a movie. I wasn't expecting that from what we have seen with the past Batman movie and comic books. Also all the hype on this movie was way over done. I think Heath Ledger was a great actor but this wasn't his best by far.,3
"Well, as I turned it off after about 20 minutes or so, it would appear, definitely, that it was just not my kind of movie. A movie, must really grab me in the beginning or off it goes. This one did not.",3
"Little too dark for me, a 50 y/o female, but hubby loved it. Said it was the best so far.",3
i still haven't watched it completely yet cuz i keep falling asleep but this movie is awesomeee!..from last time that i watched it before this copy of my own.eh on blue-ray since i don't get what the big fuss is about but wooo cuz this movie is great and with mucho action.,3
"I seem to be in the minority, but this just wasn't as good as I expected. I much prefer ""Batman Begins"". Over analyzing, I find myself wondering how the Joker managed to set so many charges in the hospital...when did he or his ""little helpers"" find the time and opportunity? Stuff like that just bugged me. But, most of all (and I suppose one has to be from Minnesota to appreciate this), the Joker reminded me way too much of Al Franken. Al Franken with lipstick on. Looked like him. Sounded like him. Easy to dislike, sure, but still...disconcerting.",3
My son likes this movie. I ordered it for him. The quality seemed to be good. It was a good price for the product.,3
"The Dark Knight Blu-ray well-received. The contents were completely without moreConfiguration was good. But no matter, even private sellers on Amazon U.S.Does the product were sent to Canada to say thrilled? Will be too upset.Amazon Sellers ""It makes you regret salgeol. hey, intervideo is the best teacherHope you have had this happen. I've seen the movie. Awesome picture quality andHas left a sound impression. Thank you.",3
"I finally watched this video the other night. It starts out very slow but then takes off with a 'shot'. It is a very 'dark' movie as all have said before me, but not it's too awfully dark emotionally as I had anticipated. It is shot in a dark cinema mode for affect. I liked the movie, though, I could not help thinking about the demise of Heath Ledger and was overcome with thoughts of his daughter who will never know him.His perfomance was good! Christian Bale and Gary Oldman, who have been overlooked, also gave good perfomances for this genre,but due to the controversy surrounding Mr. Ledger's death they have been overlooked, but that's just my opinion.I pray for Mr. Ledger'sfamily. I also pray that in time his last performance as an actor will not be over shadowed by his death.This is a definate See It!",3
"Wasn't sure what to expect, there has been so much hype about the film along with Heath Ledger's demise soI wondered if it would be a big disappointment, it wasn't. It was very well acted by all concerned, excellent special effects, some really DARK moments, all that have been described to death in other reviews, such as the mobile phone in the stomach, blowing people up etc along with the Joker, the amazing Heath Ledger (I liked him better in a Knight's Tale but he is pretty good in Dark Knight) running around Gotham City like maddened clown on prozac, not to mention Michael Caine as Batman's butler, and Batman himself, a troubled soul who doesn't know if he himself is good or bad?Worth going to see if you really the big cinema experience but I would have been happy to wait for it to come out on DVD, it was good but it's not in my top ten of movies.",3
"I had watched this movie in the cinemas. But, i'm afraid i prefer the previous bat man movies!Christopher Nolan has the habit of hiding action choreography with dark scenes, and quick micro view of fighting sequences which makes me wonder what when by. Honestly, I cannot savour the action scenes half the time, 'cos they are either hidden by the dark lighting or a partial micro view of the action!Sorry such direction may fool the rather imaginative audience who rely totally on their subconcious imagination for action, but not me. I am not convinced of the shortchanging action sequence. My ultimate hero movie is still the Spiderman trilogy, where you can savour clearly the action sequence that is really a mastery of action hero movies at its finest.",3
"The bat pot is made of plastic, detailed and nice but for a blu ray collector the case could be inconvenient. I would rate it more if additional to the bat case the package includes the regular blue box.",3
"Did anyone's set come with the same exact two discs inside the mask? My brother and I both received this from our mom on Christmas. I know the discs looks the same outside, but I put both in the dvd player and they have the same exact content on them. Anyone else find this? Wtf?",3
"I got a blu-ray version ""The Dark Knight""sound is good , but picture quality is not badalmost even that standard DVD I thinkThat's disappointedand this Bluray's most of the problem is mixed IMAX filmBecause , there's aspect ratio will changing in sometimeI been annoying while I watchingThis is not really movieI don't like thisWhat does Christopher Nolan thinking ?If standard DVD is not including IMAXI have to buy it again",3
"stunning picture on the blu ray release of this DVD but the aspect ratio changing throughout the entire picture is distracting and annoying.also, the most of the spoken dialogue is very difficult to hear.love the film - hate the DVD.",3
"Christian Bale returns as Batman in the sequal the Dark Knight. Once again he does not fail in bring the goods. He was a talent actor. The same goes to the late Heath Ledger in his Joker. Before the Joker was always a silly villain in previous Batman movies but in this one he is an awsome, twisted villain you can't take your eyes off. The sequal packs a lot action and twists I didn't see coming. Like Batman deciding to save the District Attorney rather then Rachel whom I assume he would. The District Attorney becomes the second villain in the movie as that act and his disfigurement transforms him from the good hearted hero to villain. You can see and understand why he falls from grace which has always been one of my favorite things to watch. The only problem the Dark Knight has though is it drags on and on. When you think its over it contiunes on and on.",3
"This movie was a disappointment. It was so hyped up by the press that I thought for sure it was going to be absolutely amazing, but it's not as good as Batman Begins, overall. The plot is weak, the dialogue is boring, and it's hard to follow. Not because the plot is intricate, but because the story is just disconnected and vague in places. Heath Ledger delivers a great performance as Joker--that's the best thing about this movie. Most of the rest is hype. Cool special effects and a lot of action, as you would expect, though.Not as bad of as sequel as the latest Indiana Jones flop, but just not as good as I was expecting....",3
"I loved Batman Begins, so I was eagerly anticipating seeing The Dark Knight! Especially given all the hype it received.After watching it on DVD, I felt very mixed about it. Heath Ledger was great, he definitely deserves all the praise he got for this role. The main characters are fine as well.The problems I had with the movie is that it's way too long, for one thing. Dent's character wasn't needed in this series yet. The editing wasn't as good as the first movie in that there were parts that made no sense and should have been cut.For instance, Gordon fakes his own death to keep his family out of harms way. Nice idea by itself. But then once he's back ""alive"" again his family gets taken by Harvey Dent anyway! So much for that plan.I started to get bored in some places. Again, it was just too long and unfocused for me. It had some great spots, but not enough for me to recommend this as anything better than a so-so movie.",3
"I was pretty excited to get this dvd considering all the hype about how great the movie is, however, I was pretty disappointed after watching it! This movie is okay but it is not the ""oscar-worthy"" movie that people like to say it is. Like I said in the title...it's just okay. The three stars are for the quality of the blu-ray, not the movie itself.",3
"Heath Ledger is marvelous in his final role, and that should be enough to go see the film or rent it in some months time. But be warned that all the hype come from a crowd that consider ""comic-book-movies"" as the epitome of cinema. The movie is all metaphor, and some action sequences. And it is not exactly subtle when it tells you about good and evil. Maybe the readers of this lines will think that the film reflects the world's despair in bleak times, but in fact those Grey days are American ones. As with all the other ""comic-book-movies"" of this decade (I didn't see the latest Del Toro yet) this film will be lost in time as were the serials of yore. Entertaining?, yes. Depressing?, you bet. A classic?, is not, so better put your coins for that goal into ""Wall-E"", clear winner of the relevancy contest.",3
"I saw the movie in Imax when it was released. I thought the movie was very good, and well worth the money and time. Dark is right.I previously stated that I could only watch this on my Mac, but now I found that my old LG unit was failing. I just hooked up a newPanasonic DMP-BD60 Blu-ray Disc Player, Blackplayer, and it did just fine.",3
"The trend of film remakes in Hollywood concerns me. This movie is considerably darker and more gritty than the first Batman movie. Dark isn't always bad, but was this film really necessary? The Joker didn't really feel like the Joker. Mind you, Heath Ledger did a good job in his role, but the role itself did not really fit. If you like Batman, stick with the original movies - Jack Nicholson did an awesome job as the Joker in the first. Definitely rent this movie before you actually decide to buy, this movie will only appeal to certain tastes. I especially did not like the Joker's backstory in this one.However, the first film in this series was much better and more coherent.",3
This is a very nice movie and Bluray disc quality is excellent.But Packing not good.Amazon didnt ship me the bluray with Hard Paper Cover.That not good.It suppose to come with that perticular cover.So dont go with the pictures shown for the disc discription.,3
"I heard so much about this series, so maybe my expectations were too high. The batman character seems so flat and, yes, I know he is a comic book character. Also, I felt the actor's choice for Batman's voice was too distracting. The visual effects and design were quite well done and enjoyable to watch, however.",3
the itunes version did not worked so I guess you are better off getting it somewhere else and get the cheaper dvdthe movie is by far the best batman ever!!!,3
"This movie is not as good as the first installment of this series. My first problem is the length of this thing- it seems to just go on and on. The second is that there really isn't any suspense, and you actually just don't care about how things come out. Most of the plot twists may be seen about an hour before they occur- they've been done so much better in other movies. And, you tire of watching what seems to be an endless series of psuedo intellectual dialoge punctuated by scenes of predictable and overdone violence. The special effects are good, but the action scenes eventually get to be ludicrous and even silly.I have to agree that Heath Ledger did an excellent job- much more than I expected, but the rest of the cast lets him down.",3
"This movie is a hit in our house. The acting is just superb. Rarely do I watch a movie and forget I'm watching a movie, but that happens here. Gary Oldman is fantastic as Commissioner Gordon, Christian Bale is the best Batman ever, and Maggie Gyllenhall is such an improvement over Katie Holmes there are no words.My only beef with this movie is the sound editing. If you have the volume at a normal level to hear the conversations between the characters, when the action starts you're pretty much blasted by the explosions; I find myself constantly having to adjust the sound while I watch, and keep the subtitles on so that if the sound is okay for the action, we can still understand what people are saying. Hopefully when the next one comes to DVD, the sound editing will be better.",3
"I don't understand what is so great about this movie. It's a good action flick, but not the best or most exciting.The opening scene was really good, but after that the movie got dull. If it weren't for Heath Ledger's performance, I would have not bothered watching at all. Everyone else, except for Eric Roberts who was pretty cool in his small part, was boring as heck.""Iron Man"" is a much better super hero movie.",3
I would have liked to view less violence in the film. Scariest Joker I've seen !Worth watching but not a family movie,3
"Not going to say that the movie wasn't any good, it was very entertaining( a little too long though ). Seriously come on people this movie is only breaking records at the box office do to the death and performance of Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger did an amazing job. He completely stole the show. Christian Bale was good when he was Bruce Wayne but when he put on the silly costume and became the Batman things got a little retarded. Like his voice for example. Another complaint that I have is everyone out there comparing this movie to Iron Man. Iron Man was also a very entertaining movie with flaws. Comparing the two is like comparing apples to oranges they are both two totally different types of films. So jump off of the high horse and realize that Heath Ledger is the main reason that The Dark Knight will smash box office records.",3
"The movie is great! but the features sucks! If you wanna buy cause of the movie go for it, but if you are a feature fun, then don't waste your $$$, we should wait till they come out with a better version and show more on how the made the movie etc.",3
this product is not what I am looking for. It did not improve my skin. I will not buy it again.,3
I bought this sleep mask 4 years ago for a school trip to South America. Was able to wear the sleep mask comfortably while traveling. I like the raised eyes and nose. As long as I wear it low it keeps all the light out. I have worn it occasionally throughout the years and it is now starting to fall apart a little bit.,3
"While I found Just Do It an interesting, well-written book, the book was obviously partial to Nike and Phil Knight. After reading this book, I was unsure if I could take the Nike Company at face value. Katz glosses over the issue of Nike's sweatshops, a topic which I was very interested in, and hoped to learn more about through this book. Nike is known for its powerful advertising, and Just Do It gave me many insights to the great extent that Nike goes to in making the perfect commercial.",3
"I have been a Susan Johnson fan for several years. Her stories of the Lakota Indian family (I forgot the name, but Blaze is the mother) were wonderful. Her stories are always hot and sexy with real relationships between passionate people who are not afraid to express their love for each other. While this book had her trademarks, it seemed very contrived with her trying too hard to put the hero and heroine into situations that you knew were made up just to be made up.I love her still, however, and hope she recaptures the spirit of Blaze's family in her future books.I hate to critique, however, because if I could write I'd be doing it.",3
"These women know their swing. From rocking originals like ""Salvatore"" to reinterpreted traditionals like ""Frailoch,"" this album satisfies the need within all of us for reedy rhythms. Amy Denio is an extremely talented musician AND an exceptional bandleader, and it shows. The players have obviously spent many hours practicing together, and each song is richer for the effort. Music like this, played only for the sheer love of playing, is as good as it gets.",3

Traditional songs like ""Frailoch,"" innovative compositions like ""I Will Be Sad,"" and thoughtful pieces like ""Bus Horn Concerto"" are rich and stand up well to repeat listenings. Unfortunately, the recording is just muddy enough to keep this from getting a fourth star.Fans of Amy Denio shouldn't pass this up - even if her tremendous vocal talents aren't showcased, her compostion and instrumental accomplishment shine.",3
"I have one of these jacks supporting the rear of my trailer in the driveway, it is rock steady even with four people in the trailer. I like it that these are light weight (steel jack stands can be quite heavy) and I like that these come apart easily and stack up into a compact set for storage.As far as using these for camping: hmmm. They are really too short for my camper, so I'll need to haul 2x6 pieces around to raise them up. Also, the head (the piece that touches the frame of the trailer) doesn't swivel well under load and can pop off of the frame while you are raising the stand. And the steel parts (the nut and the screw) aren't galvanized so they rust.",3
"The movie could have been better if they left out Nicolette's horrific so called acting. all the other actors did their characters justice! The make-up in first 12yrs for the female actress for the story line was gruesom, but it did get better!! All in all the movie was fine I would recommend buying this movie @ a discount only!!",3
"This is a good book for younger female audiences (10-17). The characters appeal to the reader and the descriptions are superb. The reader gets a real sense of who these people are and what summer in Silverton, Colorado, is like. I empathized with Lissa and her desire to make a life away from her aunt, who has managed her life since she was orphaned.. John is the typical ""rescuer"" but we cheer him on in his escape from his devious ex-wife, who plots to remove Lissa from his life forever.",3
"We recently purchased a 1934 Spanish Eclectic that needs not only restoration of it's former architectural integrity, but an addition to make the home work for us. This book was a good choice to provide us with a photographic ""library"" of Spanish-style homes to reference. I do wish there had been more devotion to the ""casitas"" section of middle-class homes and less to buildings dedicated to government or business; and perhaps more photographs of interiors. But it's still a great find and a wonderful addition for anyone who collects either books on architecture in general or on California architecture specifically.",4
"Hard to find these days, but worth picking up. Lots of hidden goodies on here. Can't go wrong with Sepultura's ""Chaos B.C."". And the run from Crawlspaces ""My Ruin"" all the way up to Cubanate's ""Oxyacetylene"" is full of awesome. Alien Factory's ""Higher"" is one fast paced track that fits at home at any rave. And Crystal Method's ""Come2gether"" is good not matter what mood im in.If you avoid the warts (Like G/Z/R's 'Outworld'), you have a good time with this CD.",4
Timely service and as described. I really prefer to know the editions publish date as I seek issues from 1999 and newer if possible.,4
Escape from Alcatraz depicts the full history of this infamous prison stronghold. It reflects how life was on the Rock and details the circumstances when and how 23 convicts attempted or succeeded in escaping from the island prison - the latter few never to be ever seen or heard of again. If you are interested in Alcatraz you need go no further than reading this book - it is really that good !,4
This is a beautifully conceived and photographed book of faces of people of mixed races who are wholly American. On the facing page is a handwritten paragraph of how they see themselves. It's wonderful.,4
"Great book -- I just wish it was longer! I gave a copy to my sister, who has two daughters adopted from China -- so although her kids are 100% Asian, it is likely she will have Hapa grandchildren. I also gave a copy to a friend whose husband is from the Phillipines and has 3 beautiful Hapa children --- they liked the book so much, they bought copies for their children and grandchildren. Beautiful photography, and wonderful insights into being part Asian, 100% Hapa, in an anglo world. My favorite quote is from the boy who said he is 'part Danish, but I usually don't tell people that because they think I am a pastry'.",4
"I am 100% Hapa, i was born and raised in Hawaii and i am very familar with the term and pleased to see it making its way into mainstream culture. I bought this book as a fathers day gift for my husband who is always asking why our first son looks nothings like him (he is Irish) and i am Hawaiian-Irish-Portugese.I only wish that the title of the book was more inclusive of Hawaiian and Pacific islanders who are also Hapa and originated the term.",4
"This mirror fit our mirror frame perfectly; however, the first time that door was shut it fell out and shattered. We used the adhesive system that came with it. Next time we'll use gorilla glue instead!",4
"The book overall is quite out-dated but it's message still has a singe of relevance. While world history is a fascinating subject, the history of your ancestors is even more fascinating. A powerful message that should not be forgotten.",4
"Before picking this book up to read I was aware of the knowledge I needed on African American's in the Education system. After reading it I felt empowered and sad. Empowered because now I had a little more knowledge and saddened because now I know what was kept from me all my school years. It amazes me how we were not taught any of our history not even in college. It also amazes me how people got away with not educating us.Dr. Carter shows us how 30 years ago the system was designed to keep us ignorant and as experiments. Quote from Dr. Woodson ""Negroes, being objects of charity, have received them cordially and have done what they were required."" To this day they are still using the same system but I think we are smarter now and know where the resources are to get what we need.Reviewed by Missy",4
"I am a twenty-four year old African American man and I read this book six years ago, and even at that young age I found it ""On point"". Dr. Woodson wrote this book over 60 years ago and his observations of social and educational conditions hold true to this day. This book was my introduction to my continuing studies of African American history, and I recommend that anyone beginning their studies begin with this book. There will be many instances when you will nod your head in agreement with what is stated, and other times when you will learn things about your own behaviors that you could not previously understand. The only reason that I couldn't give this book five stars is because it is a scholarly text and it is a little difficult for less sophisticated readers.",4
"The negative, incredulous readers/reviewers should read Psychiatry: The Ultimate Betrayal by Bruce Wiseman as the companion to this book. It very well may change your mind about your opinion of this work and others like it.",4
I stumbled upon this book while researching a different subject. Wow! Everyone should read this book. So enlightening. People of all educational levels will benefit from the wisdom of Mr. Woodson.,4
"I found this book to be very informatative and I was pleasantly surprised by all the valueable information that was within the pages of this book. What impressed me the most was the wealth of information concerning the African American people, especially the male gender. I brought this book because I am studying the Hebrew roots of the Christian faith and this book has clarified many questions I had about why we such a hated race of people. I wish I could buy this book for ever black male and female who is not proud of who he or she is because of a lack of knowledge of our heritage, which has been stolen from us way back in the 1600's which is actually 15th century and has been replaced with the Europeans. If you have no identity than you will become what others say your are. This book should be taught to every black elementary student as a History course so that they will come to know who they really are and where they come from.",4
"Overall, the HomeRight Auto Wash Stick works well on flat surfaces but if your car has wheel well mouldings, fender flares, spoilers, air dams, roof racks, or just about anything not flat, I find it hard to get those areas. And many places can't be gotten to no matter what. It earns a 4 star because where it can be used it works pretty good. If your car is an easy car to wash then perhaps you will really like it. Mine is a hard one to wash so when I get done, I let it dry then go back and wash the areas I missed by hand. Even with that, it's still easier and quicker than washing the whole thing with a sponge. Plus the long handle makes it easier to do the roof without stretching or reaching and the lower areas without stooping. It feels a little light duty and I worry how long it will last, but if it holds up well I would probably buy another.",4
"The backing for the mitt has a slight curve and fairly soft flex that does a surprisingly good job on and around door trim. Uses more washing solution than hand washing, but that is the only negative.",4
This puzzle was an impulse buy. But was well worth it. The pieces are large and on knobs so my little one was able to use it easily. There are only three pieces so its easy to store and keep it all together.,4
"This is a good first puzzle. It is great for practicing fine motor and hand-eye coordination. Also, my son is 12 mo. old and likes to chew everything. This puzzle is sturdy and he doesn't chew away the pictures!",4
"I purchased this product 2 years ago and still use it now and then. The smooth rollers are comfortable to grip w/o over heating your hair and fingers. The rollers form a medium curl and the clip helps smooth out frizzies. I give this product 4 stars only because the clips do not hold tight enough. I find them easy to loosen or fall out even if I am sitting still. I have long, thick, wavy hair so the roller clips may hold thinner hair better; although, that may be the ones that end up with the crease.",4
"This is perhaps the 5th set of electric style rollers that I have owned. It's probably the best, in that it heats up very quickly, which is, after all, why I use this type of product. It also has the same flaw that most electric rollers have, which no fool proof way of fastening them so that they stay in the hair. This product has a squeeze clip that fastens over the roller, once it is wrapped with your hair. It also heats up, to transfer heat to the hair from both the inside and the out. It also will leave a ""crease"" in the lock of hair, from where is clips on. No way to avoid it. I use the rollers along with a curling brush, to smooth out the crease in the front, which fixes the problem for me. Meanwhile, if you use electric rollers in general, this set is quick, and delivers a firm curl in a reasonably short period of time.",4
"I love this! Works great and is so easy to use.The big selling point for me is IT HEATS UP FAST! My old unit takes FOREVER to heat up. I just can't wait that long in the AM so I haven't used it for a long time. This heats up in less than 2 minutes.There are more than enough rollers for my hair and I found it easy to wrap my hair around them. My hair doesn't snag on these rollers at all. The clips hold my hair perfectly and after about 10 minutes I take everything off, I spray my hair and I have a head of beautiful bouncy curls.And this thing is going to last for a long time as it's very well made and high quality.But, there's no way I can keep it on my bathroom counter. It takes up a bit more space than I have free. So, I set it up on a shelf and that works fine.I appreciate having a space in the back of the unit for the plug. No more dangling cords!I'm really happy with this.",4
"Anthony Robbins is a powerful presenter. And he has a lot of practical good advice in these CDs. They are a bit pricey but...I found it useful to play each CD twice, really absorb what he is saying. I also try to go back every two or three months for a refresher session. And don't forget to keep the daily journal he recommends.If you are serious and put in the time, it will help you. It's a way of life not a one shot experience. It takes practice and commitment to implement his ideas, to succeed.So what else is new?Bottom line: this set is a useful self-improvement tool. But be sure to devote the necessary time to incorporate the ideas into your thinking and your actions.Good luck!",4
"Use to like him when I listened, is good for getting you fired up. Not sure what to think of him getting divorced after all his marital bliss. Oh well its a concept that if you stick with some good things may happen!",4

"This book provides introductory passages that illuminate the art of Tai Chi Chuan, and set a beginner on a path to cultivate internal energy. Translations of famous masters take up another chapter. The book covers all of the major styles, although the illustrations for each form(except for the simplified form) are probably meant for informative purposes only; they're not detailed enough that the reader could learn the form from studying the illustrations. Including chapters on martial applications, further combative situations involving the gentle art, weapons, meditation and Taoism, this book is probably the most thorough Tai Chi Chuan book out there. I highly recommend it.",4
"I got this cd player because I had such a hard time finding lullibies on tape. I had read the other comments but thought I would give it a try anyway.Bad points- It DOES skip when its hit, so don't hit it. The light IS dim, so what? I want the kids to sleep not see what to get into! The music IS low even on the highest setting, but then again the whole house isn't listening to it.Good points- It plays the whole CD then shuts itself off. (At least mine does!) It uses CDs which can be found ANYWHERE. Its small enough that I can put it on the wall side of my crib and I know my other children CAN'T play with it!! The buttons are a pain to get to, but thats GREAT where kids are concerned, right??As for the batteries, I've had mine a few weeks, play it EVERY night and have yet to replace the batteries.I happen to really like mine. Give it a try, save your receipt and make up your own mind.",4
"I really like this CD player. I do not understand why it has such a low review.*Yes the light is dim but I did not want a bright light. It is a nightlite. It is just fine. I can check on baby and see him fine.*The volume does not get very loud but for what this is designed for it is fine. I put in a lullaby CD and he drifts off to sleep.*The timer function if great.*The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I wish the digital readout and the buttons lite up. It is hard to see in the dark and I do not like to turn on the light to see the buttons and digital read out. Maybe in the next version the manufacture will include this.*As far as the CD's ckipping when hit, I solved that by sliding a piece of foam between the play and the rails of the crib. No there is no space to move at all and it does not skip.***It is not perfect but it does the trick!***",4
"I love my cd player. My baby uses it every time she goes to sleep...at night and for naps. I like it cause it shuts off itself. I gave it 4 stars cause I wish it would play louder,...but it truly is worth buying!",4
"Even tho these crib CD players were manufactured quite a while ago, they are still available; I bought mine at a Goodwill store. It was wonderful when our grandchildren were in cribs, but they still enjoy it when they come to spend the night. I guess it never occurred to me that an infant would need stereo sound. The volume level is sufficient for an child, since the idea is to lull the baby to sleep and not to ruin the child's eardrums. The nightlight is just enough for a child to feel safe, and yet not bright enough to keep him/her awake. Yes, it is difficult to replace the batteries but as any grandparent can tell you, if something is hard to open, give it to a child. I wouldn't want it to be easier, for safety reasons. Our 6 yr old granddaughter is staying the night and is thrilled that I found the missing CD player which I can hook onto a standard headboard.",4
"My husband and I wanted to buy this for our kids to play the lullabye CDs people had given as baby gifts, but we couldn't justify paying $50. I happened to find a used one at a rummage sale for a dollar! Much more reasonable.PROS: plays any CD; good volume control for a crib (a baby doesn't need surround sound to fall asleep); battery compartment is secured well; ""C"" batteries are best as rechargeables for something like this, since it's used every day; optional timer and programming buttons are good to customize baby's routine; dim nightlight is just enough for you see where the pacifier fell while you reset the music in the middle of the night without waking babyCONS: PRICE; CD door takes two hands to open and is noisy; I kind of wish it had a optional wall-mount or desk base for post-crib use",4
I really love this player; the light is just right for a baby; the sound is very good;I can hear it playing in the baby's room from my room at the other end of the house. My only complaint is it is hard to open but in a way that is ok too; we don't want the baby playing with it! I highly recommend this item. I may have to buy another because my 8 year old uses it after the baby is asleep!,4
"I really dont agree with the other reviews on the cd player. I can hear the player on high from a good distance and really only use the player when she is going to sleep, so how high does it have to go? I dont keep it on high as not to keep her awake, and the only issue is the light doesnt shine as bright as I thought. I keep it attached to the crib not near her head either.I dont get what the other reviewers dont get. Mine works great",4
"This book is good at first part, which provides the basic understanding on cryptography. But it is not understandable for the second part on modern algorithms and public key. I still cannot understand the advantage of modern algorithms over the ancient cryptography.The chapter Key Management seems to long for such a small issue, while the modern algorithms seems to short for such a big issue.",4
"If you want an accurate introduction to the concepts and vocabulary of cryptography, this is the book for you. The authors are clearly knowledgeable but manage to make the information provided accessable to the beginner. There are simple examples to acquaint you with some of the principles of coding and breaking codes. This is a complex subject and some of the ideas will take you into deep water. There is an excellent bibliography that one can refer to for more technical details. The book would benefit from a glossary of acronyms as some of the terminology was hard to keep straight. There could have been a little less discussion of key management. Over all a very useful and informative book.",4

Not sure whether it's the nature of the content or the style/layout, but it's not the biggest hit in our house.",4
"We just got our first issue of Ladybug Magazine. My 2 1/2 year olds enjoyed it, but I think some of the stories in there are for older children, probably a year older than mine are. That said, the publisher does give a range (2-6, I believe)and I do think that the kids will grow into enjoying all the features of the magazine. Its nice to have something other than Highlights, which the kids also enjoy.",4

"The best part of this lens is that it is stabilized and f/2.8. I can take had held shots at weddings regardless of the lighting.The downside is that it is not nearly as sharp or high quality as a L lens. It sucks a lot of dust inside which doesn't affect the pictures but could eventually be a mechanical issue. It is not sharp until around f/8 and does not handle contrast or vivid colors as well as L glass.I would recommend buying this if you need to take hand held shots with a zoom, in low light. Otherwise buy a L or a couple primes.",4
Overall it's a very good lens butts for the price make sure you really look before you buy these lengths I'm not upset that I bought them because I do video shooting but for that money it's not worth it it got better and cheaper lens out there that gives you the same type of quality,4
"I am very pleased with this lens. Last week I took approx. 700 pictures on a trip to Iran, mainly using this lense. The IS, together with the f/2.8 makes it a very good indoor lens. I some of the museums you are not allowed to use flash; this lens is solving that problem.I believa that the softness I expire in the photos is because of my D40 camerahouse, not the lens.What I am missing:- the weather-proofing you get on the L-series- the Lens Hood should be a part of the (expensive) lens- A pouch should be a part of the (expensive) lens",4

"Heinrich Boell's ""Ansichten eines Clowns"" is a fresco of postwar Germany, a very different landscape than today's. Boell's generation were tortured by remorse - and justly so; remorse humanized them. This is a novel about pain, loss and ethics: individual ethics and collective ethics; about how Hans remains faithful to his beliefs to the bitter end, about how Marie takes the path that she has to take. Together with Guenter Grass's ""The Tin Drum"" (published four years earlier), the ""Clown"" is the greatest novel of the Erhard period.",4
As a layperson I cannot comment on the accuracy of the translation but it reads elegantly and the ethos and sometimes pathos of the writers are blatantly palpable. They can be read aloud easily as they most certainly were intended for such a purpose. Two of the writers (Clement of Alexandria and Ignatius of Antioch) quite likely had direct contact with the original Apostles. The Didache may predate the gospels. In any case this collection gives a good glimpse of Christianity at its very early form. Essential reading indeed.,4
"Very good introduction to the writings of the apostolic fathers. However, I feel it was a major oversight for the author and/or publisher not to include the Epistle of Barnabus and Shepherd of Hermas in the book since these two documents are crucial to the study of early church literature. Apart from this obvious mistake, a very good book.",4

"This is a much needed tool for potty training! The only thing we would change is the ""potty guard"". It should be higher so that it covers the private parts on little boys. Sometimes we end up with a mess.",4
This is working great for us. So far she's pee'ed (spelling?) a few times and does not feel uncomfortable sitting here. Definitely a great product.,4
"My son is just getting started, but he is now wanting to sit on the potty with clothes on about 5 times a day and today he did when he first woke up. The base is nice because it has a grip and does not slide easily. I like the pull out cup too. We got white so it will be the same as everybody and maybe he will feel he is doing the same thing as everyone else. I DO reccommend this potty.",4
"I have a 14 month old. He sits on it. He doesn't scream. he's not using it as a potty yet. He climbs on it and listens to his echo while putting his face into it. Seems comfortable, will be easy to clean, not to big and akward. I'm sure it will do the job",4
"I wanted a chair with a removable bowl, but now that I've seen my son grab it and attempt to dump it out, part of me wishes I'd have gone for a toilet adapter style.If this is the style you want though, it's durable and sleek in appearance (for a potty chair, anyway).ETA: OK, now I'm glad that the bowl is removable as we're using it more, but you do have to watch for spills. It cleans easily and my son finds it comfortable.",4
"My son is now 2 years 8 months, and we started out potty training on the green frog. It's known as ""ribbit"". Well ""ribbit"" wasn't very deep, and didn't have any type of rubber gripping on the bottom of it. He seemed to be getting way too big for it. So my biggest concern was depth, and height of the back. I still wanted him to feel safe, but not pee pee over the edge. I am very pleased with the depth of this one. It fits him really good now. I'm a little worried about it fitting for the next 3 months, but we're working on it and I hope that he is potty trained in the next few months. I like the bottom of this Baby Bjorn because it does have rubber edging all along the bottom edge so it doesn't slide around the bathroom. It also has a really good front potty blocker. I would especially recommend this for parents with boys.",4
"My kids love this potty, but it does leave a red mark. It doesn't seem to bother them and it goes away rather quickly. They like this potty better than sitting on the big potty.",4
"i returned a different potty same day to purchase this one. the other potty seemed more comfortable with a cushion seat but my daughter slid off the back side and seemed like if she went in it she would squirt out the front. this potty chair she could lounge in comfortably without me thinking she's going to fall off the back, i thought it would be hard but she enjoyed looking at a book on it. the only issue i had was she got excited and tried to get off of it by herself and hit the front guard, flipping over and going facefirst into our bathroom shelving. at first glace we thought she broke her nose right across the bridge. luckily she isn't scared of the potty and her nose is ok....i'm sure as she grows a little she will be able to get off easier but just a warning, i do love this potty a lot better than the first one we got.",4
"She's still being potty trained, but she likes to sit on the chair. Easy to clean. The only draw back is that she can play with the removable bowl. She takes it out. It's simple.",4
"My son was 17 months old when I ordered/recieved this item. He was just getting interested in the potty and trying to take his clothes off. When I got the package he was right there and he tried it out right away. he fits perfectly on it, but it is a little ackward for a beiginer. Now a month latter he is seasoned at sitting down on it and getting back up. He is almost potty trained and I am convinced it is because of this potty chair.",4
"I bought this for my granddaughter as she is starting to show an interest in getting those diapers off. She likes it. It wasn't boring or scary. Which is one reason why I decided on this chair, bright colors are more interesting to a tot. She has been sitting on it. But we aren't at the take off the diaper stage yet. I do think this will be perfect for her!",4
"When I began my research for a potty chair for my son, I had no idea how many things there were to consider! I really didn't want anything that made noise or had lights but we ultimately decided on this chair because of the one-piece splash guard since I learned that it wasn't uncommon for little boys to hurt their tender bits on other chairs. It is well-made and sturdy; it didn't tip when my son got on or off. I think the main thing it did was to give my son the confidence to use a potty - his feet stayed securely on the ground and it was stable and didn't slip around. He had no problem getting himself on and off of it and he liked the 'responsibility' of dumping the contents into the big potty (I liked that it was easy for him to do that, and easy for me to clean the bowl afterward).",4
"My 2.5 year old is a big kid, 40 lbs, 38"" tall. He needs a bigger potty chair, which this is. We have the smaller baby bjorn potty we were using but he can't keep his pee in it, he's just too big. I like that the potty cup comes out to wash, but it often sticks to his bottom as he stands up from it. We've had urine on the floor several times just because of this. I ask him to hold the white cup down when he stands up, he just gets over excited when he goes and stands up right away to look inside. He sat on one at a friends house that had a cover over the removable cup, which is by far a better design, but the high back on this one makes a nice spot for spending extended amounts of time on it as he reads and tries to go. All in all, I like it and would recommend it with reservations.",4
"The Babybjorn Potty Chair has many nice features. Easy to clean--supports child, compact sturdy and simple. BUT if your child is small (like mine) the guard on the front is cumbersome. My child can't not mount the potty himself and must be placed on the potty. When he tries to get on the potty he has hurt himself in ways that makes any male member of the household wince.",4
"has a larger ""drop"" opening than a convertible potty that fits onto a toilet seat and step; better chance of your child pooping into the potty as opposed to pooping on the rear of the sitting area. However, the sitting area on the rear is also wide. If your child sits all the way back, there's a chance he/she can poop on the seat.",4
"This potty is the best. My daughter can fit on it easily unlike her previous potty. It's not the most attractive potty, very simple/plain. Overall it serves it's purpose.",4
"This IS a great potty. Easy to clean and simple in design, HOWEVER, if your son has learned to stand up to pee, then be prepared for messes and spills over the bowl and under the bowl to clean up. Of course, we are teaching him to aim in the bottom of the bowl, but in the meantime, we continue to clean up under the bowl because he aims toward the backside of the potty, which then leaks underneath the top piece and onto the floor.I still give it 4 stars because of the simple design, and I love that you just lift the top part and clean/empty it. I would've gotten their one piece smaller potty, however, my son is 2 1/2 and a big boy, so I wasn't sure if he would fit on the seat.",4

His passion and knowledge is put to the test with the arrival of a new doctor and everyone in the village are at the ends of their sanity.The wit and dry-humor are well portrayed in this series and I look forward to the release of season 6 in the near future.",4
"I've enjoyed the series tremendously, they're very entertaining. The story line continues to grow, never boring. I zipped through Series 5 and am anxiously awaiting the next season.",4
"The four stars are for a couple of episodes where the DVD stops in places for a few seconds before moving on. I hope they don't become permanent!Otherwise, it would be 5 stars for a great series with great actors and stories.",4
"This is the book you need for creating and maintaining a solid and authentic classroom literacy program. ""The First Twenty Days"" alone is extreemely helpful. You can start small and grow as you feel comfortable. A little overwhelming at times but worth it!",4
This book has helped me tremendously with my new job as a teacher. Going to school did not prepare me as much as this book has.,4
"It's a big book and I've only skimmed it. But, I've already incorporated a lot of ideas into my classroom and my 3rd grade students aren't complaining...rather they're enjoying language arts. Of course, TAKS is not until February so time will tell if it works according to my state's standards.I'm excited about another F&P; product that I saw by chance in the principal's hallway. My admins have ordered the Word Study program. I'm sure this will really help me with the Word Study part of the total F&P; Reading & Writing ""system"" [which is what the Guiding Readers & Writers book is all about].",4
"Good vibe, a bit of a homemade musical quality, and A+ lyrics...makes you remember how good a good country rockin song can be...highly recommended",4
"i would wear it more often, but it is short, so i feel like i have to hide that fact by tucking it into a coat. i love the print, though.",4
"Janis Joplin rocks on this release! Jefferson Airplane are not usually good live, but in this instance, they've polished up their act to sound best on TV! Richie Havens has always had a special place in my heart and his performances here are good. Vanilla Fudge is nothing but pure 60's nostalgia, nothing more. They're not much live, to tell you the truth. I believe that's everyone, if I'm missing somebody, it's cause they weren't that memorable.",4
"One is hard-pressed to find such a well-crafted book as this. The melodramatic goings-on of the have and the have-nots as played out in this plot will have one yelling ""yes"" or ""no"" at every turn. While not a book of tremendous substance, it is a wonderful look back at a time when senses of decorum and verisimilitude ruled the young and the old, and one's standing in society was ultimately more important than one's happiness. If that is not enough to persuade you to read this book, then how 'bout: It's a really great read and you'll finish all 506 pages in a sitting or two.",4
"A post-magical apocalypse political thriller and story about succession and inheritance in several senses.Stewart writes beautifully and creates original, well-detailed worlds. There were two aspects of this book that didn't work so well for me: first, the political thriller plot became incoherent, and second, the Chinatown culture seemed stereotypical (martial arts, empty cups of tea, whatever). On the other hand, I loved his evocation of the North Coast forest, and the way the elegance of his descriptions is grounded by down-to-earth characters and moments of humor.I'd recommend this, but not as strongly as GALVESTON or CLOUDS END.",4
"I like Sean Stewart (disclosure) but think that Perfect Circle and Mockingbird are his best works. This is quite different from those books, but still and interesting read. Perhaps this is more comparable to Galveston.This is not a ""big world"" book. It focuses on two cities in a future where magic has become strong (but is beginning to ebb again) and the two different cultures these cities have and the differences between them.It has some very clever magic. Forests that are conscious and protect some of the characters and dead armies that lightly interact with the living.Ultimately, it is a little flat in character development, but an interesting read.",4
"Overall, very good. Lot's of helpful advice. My only gripe is that training charts are written in minutes, not miles (author assumes a 10 minute mile). While this is nice from a stop-watch point of view, for those of us who run faster (or in my case, slower) than a 10 minute mile, the book was unclear whether it's more important to focus on time or mileage in one's training....",4
"We bought this for our grandson, one for his home and one for ours in hopes of getting him to want to go on the toilet and rid him of his diapers. He is now just over 2 and no luck so far but we like the seat and we are sure he will some day soon.",4
This is a nice seat but the adjustable part in the back doesn't really work for our toilet. It's ok though since it stays on the toilet nicely and doesn't move around. Works great for our little boy,4
"Easy to clean. Stays in place (even w/o using the built-in ""lock""). Seems comfrontable. Splash guard could be larger (but let's be honest, unless you're putting a Jai alai cesta on there, not sure anything is really going to contain the misses of an active 2yr old boy!)",4
"I like the style and ease of this potty seat, but for my daughter, the hole is much too big. She squirms on it, and will not use it unless I am holding onto her-she starts to slip and fall in. I am having to end up buying a much smaller seat. Hopefully she will grow into this one. She is 2 1/2 and a little on the small side.",4
"Love this seat. My daughter is almost 3 and fits perfect on it. No slipping around and fits any size toilet. I gave it 4 stars because I feel it's a lot of money for a toilet seat, but it works better then the ""fun"" cartoon kind.",4
"Here is what I like about this:- you can adjust some fitting with the turn of a dial on the inside back of the seat so that it doesn't shift when on the Toilet (this way I can use it on different toilet bowls and it sits steady)- just one piece (that way things don't get in between the pieces), less mess and easy to clean- contoured etc and all the stuff they say in their descriptionWhat I wish was different: I wish that the seat was a little cushioned. If he's been on the potty for a while, poor thing has red marks on his butt. (it goes away, just don't like seeing that)",4
just starting out but the potty fits great on an adult toilet and is great for a boy sitting down.,4
"I would have given this product 5 stars for design, comfort and ease of use but quality was a big issue. As most moms who are potty training know, it's kind of messy. I was wiping down the potty seat with a Lysol wipe and the oval handle at the back of the potty seat cracked along the plastic edge. The potty seat can still be used, but it was disappointing considering the price. I probably wouldn't let this discourage me from purchasing the product. It's a great design that can be used easily and makes the potty look more comfortable for little ones.",4
"This was in between the bjorn potty and the real toilet and my son really didn't mind using the big toilet with this. He felt very secure. If needed, it's easy to take on a car trip for other bathrooms.",4
"Overall, I'm very happy with this product. No wonder everybody raves about it!The only feature that needs to be improved are the handles on the sides.This is quite a pricey toilet trainer and it deserves handles.",4
"Our daughter has been getting better at warning us when she has to use the potty, thanks to the reliability of this product. As other reviewers have noted, it does not move and is very stable.Pros:- if your child likes pink, your child will like this!- stable adjustable adapter- easy to clean: no soft cushion or other places for urine to accumulateCons:- for the price, it would be nice to include a hook designed to hold the seat, say...one that hangs over the edge of the water tank, or an adhesive mount on the side- no side grip handles",4
"This seat is great - it has a mechanism that fits it to your toilet so it won't rock or slide and is solid plastic construction, so it won't crack like the padded seats do (will definitely last through my babies and can be passed along in great condition). The pee guard doesn't work great for my baby yet (we EC and he's 13 months and small for his age anyway, so it'll probably do better as he grows). He feels safe on it, though, and can sit independently quite well and is similar in shape and feel to his Baby Bjorn Little Potty, so it works for us!",4
"We tried a couple of other options before finding this seat. It is far better than other potty rings b/c it clamps onto the toilet seat so it doesnt wiggle around. The others were hard for my son to balance b/c they moved back and forth on our elongated seat. This one solved that problem. It is also more contoured so it seemed a more comfortable fit for him.It is easy to remove and place. We did finally opt for a built in all in one seat when my son started learning to pee standing up because it was even easier to get out of the way but, for just starting potty training, this seat is quite good - a step above the other potty rings.",4
This potty seat fit on all of my different toilet seats without a problem. My son can sit on it for long periods of time without getting uncomfortable. He's on the younger side at 18mo and the fit is just fine for him. The splash guard could of course be a little higher but we haven't had any major issues with this one. It does what it's supposed to and the ability to adjust the seat for a snug fit is what makes this seat so good. Other seats have slid around and this one stays put.,4
"If you have a boy... this is the only one that would fit the needs. We tried three other brands before this one and while they had their own merits, none would understand a boys needs better than this one. Fits perfectly on the toilet and can be adjusted if needed.",4
This is a pretty good album. A few of the songs are tear-jerkers and tear-jerk they will. A very beautiful score for a very sad movie.,4
"Without revealing too much about my feelings towards the movie, the soundtrack definitely stuck out amongst the drama, crazy characters, and melancholic undertones of the film. It is a picture perfect example of where sometimes the music is so good, it steals the attention away from the film itself. Particularly noteworthy is ""Loverly Spring,"" a cracked-out, hyper-happy ditty about a little elf, and a jaunty rendition of a classical piece played during the final credits, which, unfortunately, seems to have been omitted from the soundtrack. ""Drive Away"" is also ridiculously catchy and perfectly dark for this bizarre film.Well done, Mr. Newman.",4
"This is a nice unit to carry in the shirt pocket. I hate the lack of an optical view, the LCD is NOT convenient for point and shoot type photos. Especially out-doors. This is a special purpose camera and is very good for posed in-door or nature shots. Also, in the practical use of this unit, it is best to crank it down to the 3.2 pxl mode, or other lower res. The close shots at 5 pxl are phenomenal, every detail of a product label for example is perfectly reproduced. Good toy, but I like my DSC-P73 for every day use.UPDATE: 3/08 Still going strong, batery life is excellent, I use it regularly to document daily events around the house, have a date stamped history of baking, cooking, re-model events and renovations. Also have on several ocaisions taken before and during pics of projects that are useful in re-asembly and restoration.",4
Very easy to operate. This camera takes beautiful pictures outside. The lighting has to be right inside.,4
"I wish there were photos of the insides on Amazon or Kensington's website. It has more room than I thought it would. The back is especially roomy - it's divided by the handle assembly, bit there's exactly enough room for my Bose QuietComfort2 case on one side and my laptop powerbrick and food on the other side.The inside main compartment has enough room for TWO 15"" computers (although only one would be padded), plus a few folders, mags or paperback books. Based on the ads and some other comments, I thought the styling might be too ""girly"", but it's not. The strap is hard to remove, so I just keep it short and leave it on. I was able to use the strap to attach it on my main luggage for wheeling through the airport. By itself, the handle is a good length (I'm 5'8"").",4
"Wishmaster, Nemo and Oceanborn all rate higher than a five so this just gets a five (let's farget about the horror tha was Century Child). It's a really powerful album although not as classic as the other albums, Tarja stull has a powerful voice especially in Elvenpath and Astral Romance. Get this album. Though if your a newbie then I recommend Wishmaster and Oceanborn first.",5
"first off i not a kid ect. This album is excellent, but the only thing I didnt like was the male vocals, but Tarja's voice is beautiful. Anway except for the male vocals, this was an amazing CD.",5
The Discs were in original unopened packaging and work perfectly. We love the series and enjoyed the extras at the end.,5
"to the reviewer whodat, the price for all the sets are the same. Amazon chose to only give a discount of 15% on this set as compared to 25% off on the first two.",5
"I first seen this movie when i was about 10 years old. It really freaked me out with its wierdness but years after, when i got to about 19 years old, i still couldnt get it out of my head. Then i started wondering if its out on DVD, to my surprise, it was! WOW! I thought i was the only one who really dig this film, slapstick humour, perfectly cast characters, some sexy, not to mention, psycho chicks & troma style gore! Even the main characters get in touch with thier darkside's! Its a classic & includes a lot of characters from the toxic avenger movies. Its a classic troma film, & a stand-alone awesome independant film aswell. If u aint seen a Troma film b4, definetly check it out. It bends hollywood rules & goes beyond them! Lloyd Kaufman's a genius! Its a low budget film but some of the special FX will amaze you....By the way, i havent even got the 1 with special features like deleted scenes & commentary, so even more reason to buy this, i am.",5
Class of Nuke Em'High is so awesomely bad!!! It is the best 'bad' movie I have ever seen! I have watched this movie over and over for more than 10 years... I know every word and every scene... I can also point out all the mess-up's!! I never get tired of seeing this film!!,5
"If you have seen the movies or know the story, the book is a completely different experiance! Beautiflly written and so much more than just a story about a man who doesn't age while the portrait does. Captivating and darkly thought provoking.. Great writting and facinating characters. Highly recommended!",5
I have watched the old movie of this story and the newer one but had never read the book. This was excellent!,5
"Classical, timeless and wonderfully written tale of that expands on the 'how evil corrupts your soul' theory.",5
"I listened to the audio version, which was a delight. This classic impresses upon the reader the importance of Christ's rhetorical question: what does it profit a man to gain the whole word but lose his soul? Wilde also underscores the point that true beauty resides in the eternal soul not the temporal body. This is a book to read and re-read.",5
"I was highly impressed by this novel of arts, society, morality and immortality. It has to be one of the most deepest things that I have ever read. One thing that bothered me a little was how Oscar Wilde went through this long winded prose and at times became a bit essay like but it had gave me food for thought.",5
"I haven't actually read the book yet, but dang does it look good on my shelf! Penguin clothbound is wonderful.",5
"Great book, very quick read and a must for anyone who really wants to understand the english cannon. I think I've seen 3 ""Twilight Zone"" episodes that feature the same plot though, kind of ruined the surprise halfway through...",5
I love this book! I completely think that I have fallen in love with the character Lord Henry. He is by far one of the wittiest characters that I have ever read in a book and trust me that I have read many books! I think that Oscar Wilde was a genius and this is one of the best literary works that he has written.It is a story of innocence lost and the quest of forever staying young.,5
"This is a beautiful book, full of vivid word pictures. Wilde is a genius of literature. Everyone should read this book",5
"The Picture of Dorian Gray is an amazing story told with such wonderful truth and cynicysim as only Wilde could tell it. Not only do I have much of the book highlighted, but it is worn from reading again and again. I would definitly reccomend this brilliant novel to anyone who wants to walk away with a feeling as if they've discovered a treasure they must share with the world.",5
This is a beautiful and witty tale about a depraved man. His ugly soul is mirrored by his ever-changing portrait while he retains his youthful visage. Suspenseful throughout. A classic.,5
This book is a facsinating read that blends insult and injury quite well. Fat and ugly people surely will be delighted or destroyed. Wittisms roar and pundits will roll in hedonism for the intelligentsia. A must-read for good-looking people and geniuses everywhere.,5
"After reading this story of a man who is so caught up in beauty that he ruins his life over it, I took the time to examine my own feelings on many things....Wilde has done it again in this one.I LOVED IT!!",5
"Still controversial today, Wilde's study of a man's moral distintigration is both richly poetic and ultimately disturbing. The book even resists classification today. Is it part of the Decadence movement or the Symbolist movement?Or is it an experimental novel, fashioned perhaps as a psychological gothic study? More importantly, though, Wilde's creation poses the question: Can a book be poisonous? Gray succumbs to the ""evil"" influence of Huysmans' book A Rebours. As Wilde as written, ""there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. Books are well written or badly written."" Wilde may have created a well written book, but he also, albeit purposely, created a book when, viewed from its many horizons, can be seen as terrible moral study in the lesson Gray undergoes.",5
I've only just started reading the book but so far I've enjoying what I've read of it to this point.,5
"I quite enjoyed the sharp witty dialogue,particularily that of Lord Henry who was one of the most interesting and provocative characters I've come across in quite some time.",5
"First of all, it is free and it is a classic you cannot miss. Short lecture with a great story",5
"This is a kick-ass rock group! I heard them on the AllGirlRadio station on the internet, and loved them!!! It's good to hear some good old rock, especially from women! Being a huge Joan Jett fan, I really appreciate this group!",5
"This band is simply awesome. The vocals are hard without being overbearing and the music demands respect. Each track is just as rockin' as the last, there are no dull moments here.",5
"This is a wonderful resource for clinician's, especially those that may NOT be used to working with TBI, right CVA and the higher level dysfunctions. It has exercises, compensatory strategies for both the patient, and suggestions for the patient. I've used it for years.",5
"Until Death Do Us Parta is the first book I've read from this author and it was GREAT. I recommend to everyone who like romance, suspense and mistery. This is not your run-of-the mill romance, suspense story !!This fantastic, suspense packed story is one that I will be keeping in my favorites file. These well described and highly developed characters have such an emotional bond between them that it brought tears to my eyes many times while reading this tale! Readers will not want to put this book down.This story for me was one that I didn't want to put down and when I absolutely had to, it kept calling my name until I could get back to it. GJT Simpson has got himself a new fan with this captivating and enchanting book and I can't wait to read what else he has in store!!! Outstanding! *****",5
We love it! We saw it last year at the camp ground. I got it for my B-day and enjoy the simple use and small size. When there is not fire pit or fires are not allowed that's the winner!,5
"It works great,the only thing Idon't like is the cheesy fake log, it would much better with the fake logs that come with gas fireplaces.",5
I used this book for a graduate class on public finance. The price was right and all the students had access to the electronic copy. The book content was very good for our purposes and allowed me to discuss the topics without the need for an overly expensive text book.,5
"i bought these socks at first because they looked funny and was curious so i thought i would give it a try. It did take some time to get used to having my toes being separated, but after a while, i don't even want to take them off. It did get kind of embarrassing when i take my shoes off in front of people though. but overall, i do like these socks.",5
At first the socks feel a bit constricting but after 5 minutes you can't feel them at all. I just ran 5 miles and had no blisters or sore toes for the first time. I am buying two more pairs now :),5
"I wear these with my vibrams and love them - have never gotten a blister. I've also used them in a bunch of races, as much as 100 miles, and had great luck. However, if you're doing a race that's going to be really wet or have stream crossings, I would recommend getting one of the higher cut ones since the lowest cut one can fall down when it gets really wet, which is annoying and makes heel blisters more likely.",5
"I have only had these for a short time, but after a few hours of wearing them to get used to the extra material, I am really enjoying them. I use these socks not only when running, but for basketball and tennis too. Works great so far, and I am going to buy more of them.",5
"I wear these type socks and footlets for relief from one toe that has started going under the toe next to it. On my feet for hours and it gets painful. These are well made, keep toes straight (like when I was younger) and keep me going painfree. I wish this company made this style, little footlets that don't show with dress shoes.",5
"injinji Micro Toesocks are very well made. The material seems to very comfortable. They stay in place, without slipping down in my shoes",5
"I bought these socks for my Five Fingers, but ended up running a marathon in them. I was having bad blisters on the tops of my second and third toes after long runs (15+ miles) and gave them a shot. For the marathon, I also sprayed some second skin (I forget the brand) but afterwards I had no blisters anywhere. Very happy with these socks. (As an aside, I also own the lightweight version of these. Great for Five Fingers, too loose for regular shoes.)",5
"At first I hated these socks because I never wore toe socks and the only reason I bought them is because I bought me a pair of vibram toe shoes. After awhile I got use to it being between my toes and now I love them and are by far the most comfy socks, while second best. Asics are the best but these are better than any Nike socks.",5
"These socks were for my son, who runs lots of races. He was getting blisters on his toes, but with these socks, no more blisters. He wears them under high quality running shoes, and under minimalist shoes. He's very happy with the socks.",5
These socks are great. I bought them to wear with my Vibram Five Fingers. They are soft and fit nice and snug and don't bunch up and the heel doesn't ride down as I run. Great find!,5
"I bought these socks on a whim because I just purchased a pair of Vibram FiveFinger Bikila LS toe shoes. Love the shoes, but I am not wearing these socks with them because the shoes are skin tight without the socks. I have ended up wearing my injinji's with every other pair of shoes I own. I currently have 3 pairs of these socks and will be purchasing more very soon. I will never wear a regular pair of socks again. I am officially a toe-sock convert. They allow a greater range of motion and completely eliminate toe bunching caused by socks.",5
"Great toe socks, my sisters bf loves them. He wears them all the time with his toe shoes, and they are super soft.",5
"Finally some toe socks for guys withh big feet. These are wonderful and comfortable, will be getting more of these.",5
"very good product, excellent time and attention me dieron respuestas a mis preguntas and get my order in the time ordered",5
Item was Shipped fast and it was exactly what I expected and my son loved the socks thank you very much!,5
"I absolutely love these socks, they are the most comfortable socks I've ever worn in boots or cross trainers. I need about 10 more pair.",5
If you own Vibrams these are a must. Vibram sold toesocks are over priced. Injinji makes microfiber in all sizes compatible with Vibram socks and are more affordable. Especially since my Vibrams with shipping took me over 100 bones.-Sgt of Marines,5
"I have had a pair of vibram five fingers KSO treks for about two months. I love the shoes which recently started causing blisters in certain areas. I broke down and started buying these socks which have not disappointed. They have eliminated the foot odor in these leather shoes as well as provided a comfortable snug fit for me. Granted, all feet are different and I tend to have some long skinny toes. These stretched to fit comfortably. They seem to be made of quality material.I would not run around sock-footed in these since carpet will ultimately wear holes in them. So far I have machine washed them multiple times and they have retained their shape without stretching. These socks are great to use even if you do not have a pair of vibrams. They work well in regular shoes. I have even worn them in insulated boots.",5
"I bought these socks to wear with the Merrell barefoot model shoes and it was very conclusive. The toes feel great separated like this, it's a bit like not having socks at all. I was afraid to be cold but after walking for a while my feet were hot and at ease.",5
This DVD is for those of us who are not young gym bunnies. It's a good way to ease into yoga.,5
Got to me quick and timely. Used them to mount a 130/90-18 on a spoked rim with inner tube. Never came close to biting the tube. Enough length for leverage if you take small bites. Nice size to carry.,5
"first off, i love trains, the sound of rumbling trains in the night, anything to do with trains. ive always loved the idea of hopping freight trains. there aren't very many books on the subject. ive read hopping freight trains in america which is a great manual if you are planing on taking a ride. this book gave an inside view on what its like to live the tramp life. after reading this it made me want to ride the rails even more. great book.",5
"OK...here's the drill...a lot of semi-pro or pro musicians cringe at the thought of putting a Digitech ""anything"" in their signal chain. But recently, I went to a local venue, and heard this guy playing super transpearent lead guitar lines, while maintaing the sound of his single coil insturment, but it sounded like tubes being overdriven, all from a 15 watt amp. I snuck a peak at his modest pedal board....and there was a Badmonkey!This pedal took the place of a handmade pedal on my board that was 5 times the cost! YouTube has some great vid reviews. But this will be the best $49 you'll spend on a pedal desinged to maintain the integrity of you guitars unique sound, yet give you enough dirt/grind to feel like you're playing through a Narrow Panel Tweed at 10. This is NOT for Metal Heads...this is strictly old school, blues, country or jazz/fusion only. Combine it with a ZD or TS, and it's magic on a budget!DigiTech DBM Bad Monkey Overdrive Guitar Effects Pedal",5
"If you've ever even THOUGHT about going to work for the U.S. Government, BUY THIS BOOK!! Full of useful information that federal job hunters MUST have to succeed.",5
Louis Begley is able to convincingly write of survival as seen through the innocence and straightforwardness of a young Jewish boy. A boy whose life gradually becomes a web of lies and inward and outward loss. Loss which he will ultimately not be able to ever recover from. This is a short book with appeal to adults and young adults given the young protagonist and appropriate content.,5
"The best part for me is Part three of the book, it presents a realistic implementation of Battleship game using client server, it covers all the interesting aspects in a very clear and incremental manner.Chapter 18 is paricularly good, it starts from a very simple active object, explains how it works, then moves on to the pattern, also explains why he favors one approach over the other, the mistake he made etc.Part Three - Communications and Systems ProgrammingChapter 16 - Communications and Systems ProgrammingChapter 17 - The Transaction-oriented Games StackChapter 18 - Active ObjectsChapter 19 - Client-server FrameworkChapter 20 - The GSDP ServerChapter 21 - GDP ImplementationsChapter 22 - Full Battleships",5
The Eyewitness DK guides are beautiful books in their own right--you would enjoy reading them even if you didn't make the trip. The text is well organized and extensively illustrated with artwork and 3-D pictures of the major tourist attractions. The directions are excellent and they direct you to the important things to see at each location.A particularly helpful feature is a section with specific instructions on how to use Vienna's extensive public transportation system including a description of the various types of tickets and pictures of the ticket machines.This guide blows the competition out of the water.,5
"Alot of times i will have trouble getting into racing games due to 1 or 2 small things that make the game a drag... but this one i have beaten 3 times and still enjoy playiong it!!!!The Cars are excellent (i love the hearse), Physics and Damage are amazingly realistic.... very cool unlockable Videos. Tons of diffrent race modes, and a Very good soundtrack!!!The ONLY thing that i think is a little dissappointing is the fact that SOME of the event types are not playable in the Carreer mode (out of about 25 diffrent styles of events..only about 3 are NOT in the Career mode).I recomend you pick up this game.. if you like racing, and like Demolition derby style play... You will love this game Beyond words!!!!",5
it has demolition derby figure 8 trailer races oh lord when i buy this game im afraid to ask what other crazy events await me in this chaos and mayhem game,5
"This was one of the best mysteries I've listened to in a long time--I had the audio version which was well read. I liked the unexpected twists, and every time I thought I had it figures out, another twist would send me down a different path. Well done. I'm looking forward to more stories by this author!",5
this is such a great movie.. loved it.. would of seen it over and over in the theater if the prices werent so high... definatly a buyer..,5
I downloaded it on to my kindle and I enjoyed watching it instantly. No problems purchasing or downloading it. Amazon made it easy for me to purchase things like this movie for my kindle.,5
This movie was very good and the whole family enjoyed it.We can't wait for part 2.I would recommend this movie.,5
"This is by far the best movie of the series and for a first for me, my new very favorite movie. This movie stayed closer to the book then the others and I thought it was great!!Besides the actors, which I adore, the makeup artist was phenomenal!!Billy Burke is heavily under-rated; he was great!!The setting and backdrop was fantastic!!I think Bill Condon will be in very high demand because of his ability to stay true to the writer's work and give it wonderful vision. Very few other directors have this gift.If you have read and enjoyed the books, this movie will ring truer for you than the others.But I still like them too.",5
I have been trying to find somewhere to get Breaking dawn for a wonderful price. Finally after looking I found this one and I love it. It was in great shape. The shipping was fast as well.,5
"The movie was very close to the book, in the sense that the wedding, honeymoon, and birth were captured with a variety of emotions that the people watching the movie could feel those emotions. Also, the soundtrack was spectacular, in the honeymoon they used Turning Page by Sleeping At Last that if you read the lyrics you will be captivated even if you don't believe in true love.",5
I loved it and am really glad to add it my collection.I ordered another copy and will give it to myGreat grandaughter in college.,5
My granddaughter loves all things to do with the Twilight series. She said this movie is awesome and would highly recommend it.,5
"I love the series! They are great movies, I have watched them over and over again. Well worth buying them!",5
"Breaking Dawn is a story of two teens gradually growing and facing adult choices, decisions and consequences. Edward and Bella wed, and the adventure ends at a point midway in the book, at the moment she wakes as a vampire. Keep watching. There is a little bit more to the story.",5
"it was great to watch again, I remember watching it afew years ago and it's still as great as ever. I would recommend it to anyone to buy.",5
"You either like the movies or you don't. Of course, I do so I am very please with the product and the customer service.",5
It was in great conditions and it came very fast even a while month before Christmas.Very pleased with it.,5
Anyone who likes the Twilight Saga will like this one. It was beautifully portraid in movie form. And the ending was great!,5
"I am, as usual, very pleased with my order. It was delivered in a timely manner and in in excellent condition. If you like the serious I would recommend adding this one to your collection.",5
This movie was great I am a huge fan of The Twilight Saga and have watched this several times and can't wait for part 2.,5
"In the first place, this item was well packaged. It arrived on time and was in great condition.As far as the item itself is concerned, I love it! I made the mistake of reading the first book since one of my vices is vampire lore. The books were so well written, that I ended up viewing and later purchasing the DVDs in relation to each one. However, the books are still better because they provide a much richer story.",5
"Okay this has got to be the best movie in the twilight saga and it is far the best. The action is the greatest,It's great to see that Bella and Edward finally get married but theirs only one problem Bella gets pregnant and now she will have to make a life decision of what shes going to do because she has a lot to go through, Will she die or will she stay alive. This is the best movie from the twilight saga and it deserves five star's. I can't wait for Part 2 which will be coming out next November, But for now this is the best movie so far in the twilight saga =)",5
LOVE IT. TELL EVERYONE TO SEE IT I WATCH.I WATCH THIS MOVIE OVER AND OVER AGIGN THATS HOW MUCH I LOVE IT,5
"I now have all but the last movie in the series, and love this movie series, so I'm not complaining at all.",5
"While the first 3 Movies stayed somewhat close to the books, ""Breaking Dawn-Part 1"", has a lot of thing's that are different in it... I know that they can't put EVERYTHING from the book into the movie, but there were a few time's that I found myself thinking 'Why did theydo this/that???', 'How did they get from there to here???'Even with those thing's, it's still a GREAT Movie... One that you diffently want to see... I just hope they release it on DVD soon... I also can't wait to see -Part 2-, I think it's going to be sometime in July or around then...",5
My now 13 year old daughter loves it and it was just what she wanted to make her collection as complete as possible.,5
This is a part of the same movies my son wanted. Now all he needs is breaking dawn 2 he can't wait for it.Thank you so much.,5
This was gift to my daughter for Christmas. She was so excited to have received it. She is a huge Twilight fan. She loved it!!!,5
I am fan. Love Vampire movies anyway. creating a love story of such between a vampire and human and then to produce a child was great. again I loved it.,5
"I'm old enough to be all the actors mother, but still find the whole Twilight Saga charming. The acting is very good and Rob Pattenson is his usual sexy self, this is the first time he has to struggle at something without Bella at his side, but all works out well. If you love the other movies, you'll love this one too. The only thing was there were only a couple bruises, what's the big deal? For him to be so upset they could've marked her up a little more. The sex scenes were sweet and tastefully done, love it when he moans! But why did the other vampires stop hunting when she comes home pregnant? Just remember its a modern fairy tale and go with the flow and you'll enjoy this movie too.",5
My collection is almost complete. It was very hard finding the right dvd version that is similar to borders' twilight and new moon. It is what I thought it was. And what I wanted.,5
"Love this movie. My daughter got me watching them and I was hooked. Even if you didn't read the books, you can still enjoy the movies.",5
"Loved this movie!! The Twilight movies just progressively get better, and I live having the double DVD with all the special features!",5
"This was my favorite Twilight movie so far. I've got to say, I was a little nervous about this one. With a wedding, honeymoon, and a baby, I didn't think they would be able to fit all of that in a two hour movie. I am completely Team Jacob(Taylor Lautner) but, I also found myself liking Edward (Robert Patterson)in this one. I always thought he was cold-hearted. He showed emotion and he had a personally in this movie. I never saw that before. He was also a good husband. Not to big on having a baby, but he had good reasons. He came around in the end when he knew the baby wasn't a demon, and that's all that matters. It is rated PG13 and comes with Special Features.",5
"This movie is one of the best I have seen! When I went to the theater I was so excited. When I came out I was looking through every store to pre-order it. I would suggest this movie if you like Romance and Drama, and Baby Renesme. It was Ah-Mazing!!!!",5
I've never read the books so I wasn't a big fan going into Twilight but the movie did a great job of engaging you and anxious to see Part 2. Great bonus features too on the making of the movie. I would recommend buying it.,5
Love Twilight. Any gift I receive that is Twilight related is a winner in my book. Huge Fan! ! !,5
Awesome movie and at a great price of only .99. Thank you for the opportunity to rent the movie. now i am caught up on the series.,5
My daughters are hooked on the twilight series and love this DVD. It is awesome and in great codition. Thanks,5
Excellent. I have the complete series and this is an excellent movie. I thought it was neat it was filmed in Washington.,5
"By far this was the best Twilight movie. I loved it! I saw it twice. It was funny, sad and exciting. I believe it was true to the book. I would even have to go as far as to say it was better than the book. I thought the sex scene would be horrible because it was PG-13 ( and I am 34) but they did a great job at capturing what needed to be captured and did it in a tasteful way. Pattinson is adorable! Stewart did an outstanding job! I cant wait to get my DVD copy!",5
I bought this one to help complete my collection and to watch all of them prior to the release of the last movie in theatres. Love this series.,5
"I cannot wait for this to come out. I have all of the other movies and books. Also went to see them all in theaters. My fav movie was the first Twilight, but this one is close second. I don't see how their gonnna fit the rest of Breaking Dawn into one movie. But I can't wait to see!",5
"Saw the movie in the theater, but wanted the DVD to watch from time to time. Wife loves the music and got me hooked.",5
