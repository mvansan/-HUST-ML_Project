"This is a self-published book, and if you want to know why--read a few paragraphs! Those 5 star reviews must have been written by Ms. Haddon's family and friends--or perhaps, by herself! I can't imagine anyone reading the whole thing--I spent an evening with the book and a friend and we were in hysterics reading bits and pieces of it to one another. It is most definitely bad enough to be entered into some kind of a ""worst book"" contest. I can't believe Amazon even sells this kind of thing. Maybe I can offer them my 8th grade term paper on ""To Kill a Mockingbird""--a book I am quite sure Ms. Haddon never heard of. Anyway, unless you are in a mood to send a book to someone as a joke---stay far, far away from this one!",1
"A complete waste of time. Typographical errors, poor grammar, and a totally pathetic plot add up to absolutely nothing. I'm embarrassed for this author and very disappointed I actually paid for this book.",1
"I guess you have to be a romance novel lover for this one, and not a very discerning one. All others beware! It is absolute drivel. I figured I was in trouble when a typo is prominently featured on the back cover, but the first page of the book removed all doubt. Wait - maybe I'm missing the point. A quick re-read of the beginning now makes it clear. This has to be an intentional churning of over-heated prose for satiric purposes. Phew, so glad I didn't waste $10.95 after all.",1
"I feel I have to write to keep others from wasting their money. This book seems to have been written by a 7th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age! As another reviewer points out, there is a misspelling on the cover, and I believe there is at least one per chapter. For example, it was mentioned twice that she had a ""lean"" on her house. I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot, that I decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling. Please don't waste your money. I too, believe that the good reviews must have been written by the author's relatives. I will not put much faith in the reviews from now on!",1
"Rather than scratches and insect droppings, this one has random pixelations combined with muddy light and vague image resolution. Probably the cue should have been the packaging is straight out of your street corner bootleg dealer.If you've ever seen a reasonably good condition film copy, you know the defining visuals of his film are the crystal clear lighting contrasts in black and white. The surrounding countryside and 'old home' scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright, clear, and immediate.Here everything is dull, dark, and clouded. Or, if you remember the timbre and enunciation of Captain's commands, so are the visuals.After that, it is hard to believe this award winning, critically acclaimed film's best presentation is on YOUTUBE. Somewhere ""out there"" is a DVD that comes up to the standard of a 16mm public library reel.Just none of them appear to be on Amazon.",1
"I bought this charger in Jul 2003 and it worked OK for a while. The design is nice and convenient. However, after about a year, the batteries would not hold a charge. Might as well just get alkaline disposables, or look elsewhere for a charger that comes with batteries that have better staying power.",1
"The plot is so ridiculous, I have to wonder if they even read the script before making this film. The mountain lion breaks out of his trailer - and the cars behind don't notice? The mountain lion is captured - and put in a jail cell? Get real! Utterly, completely stupid.",1
"If you have even casually looked into applying to law school, have already read everything there is in this book, do not waste your money, seriously!!",1
"It clearly says on line this will work on a Mac OS system. The disk comes and it does not, only Windows . Do Not order this if you have a Mac!!!!!!!",1
"I bought this for my wife for her birthday,and had toreturn it because the DVD palyer would not work. I returned it and got a repalcement, which once again the DVD player failed to work! It is a piece of junk.",1
"If you want to listen to El Duke , then it is better if you have access to his shower,this is not him, it is a gimmick,very well orchestrated.",1
"The screen arrived in a cardboard box that was pretty beat up. The screen itself is very lightweight, very cheesy looking. The ""finish"" was worn across the entire top of the screen. I knew this wasn't solid brass, but I expected something that at least looked decent from a distance for the price I paid.",1
"I ordered this DVD and received a substitute I never received the DVD I ordered from Importcds (the Vendor). I contacted them and did not recieve any feedback. I can't rate a DVD I have never seen. I didn't bother to send it back because it would have cost me more that I orginally paid for it. In the future I will watch for the name of the person and/or persons I am buying from. I thought they were a good company. I understand a simple mistake but, to not get a response at all is not good businees sense. I spend hundreds of dollars a month on Amazon.com building my DVD collection. I guess I will be more careful in the future.",1
This book drew air pretty bad. I have no idea why someone would waste their time writing it. Boy did it draw air. Do not read this book.,1
"I ordered the cake topper June 27, 2010. I was given an estimated shipping date of July 1-7, 2010. Those dates came & went with no cake topper. I contacted the seller twice with no response. I filed a claim with Amazon. I did end up receiving a cake topper on July 16, 2010; however, it's not even the one I ordered! The seller did refund my money, but has never contacted me or apologized for the mishap. I will never buy anything from the seller again. I looked at the seller's feedback & I'm not the only person they have done wrong, so buyer beware!!",1
"I am disappointed in its performance. It seems underpowered and is constantly trying to read CDs, half the time unsuccessfully. I am going to try to return it to Amazon.",1
"I did not know this was the audio cd of the game, I thought it could be used on the playstation. Maybe the other guys are from the US or somewhere where it is actually easy to get the game,and play it,but this was all in japanese and was not compatible with my machine. I am deeply disappointed as i love the arcade game, but the Dance stage euromix (Dance Dance Revolution equivalent) is lacking in decent tracks, many are jungle-y and are difficult to dance to them. Also, most of these tracks are unheard of here and are therefore not very enjoyable. However, my favourite are Keep on moving, make a Jam, and Video Killed the Radio star. But it gets a bit pedantic if you keep playing on these tracks. If anyone is in the same situation as I am, or those of you who are lucky enough the play on the newest version, can you please let me know where I can order one? I am in dance deprivation/boredom!",1

This book vaguely breezed across history and went into various types of timber structures. The mortise and tenon joints that were illustrated were fascinating but not practical for a home builder.,1
This product smells when you open the package and it appears one of the gel cushions leaks so I spent $10 and havent worn then. I wouldnt buy this product again. Dont waste your money on something you may not be able to use.,1
"I first tried buying this tape from a Marketplace seller. I sent it back because the tape quality was poor and the packaging looked unprofessional. After returning it I bought one from Amazon proper and . . . it was the same quality tape and the same packaging. Since I'm now sure this is not a bootleg tape, all I can say is . . . some videos are better than others.",1
"I should have read the prior reviews of this record before buying it. Although it appears to be a collection of new wave singles from the 80s, these are just cover versions sung by the ""Starlite Singers"". The description of the record says that it is by ""various artists"" implying that they are by the original artists, but this is not true. Total garbage. The one bright spot is that I got a prompt refund when I returned it.",1
"This is one of those cheesy compilations where they find session bands and similar sounding artists to sing the songs. These are NOT ORIGINAL SONGS BY THE ARTISTS. If you loved K-TEL CD's and don't care about hearing the artists originals, and don't care about cheap sounding synthesizers playing the music or that fact that some of the vocalists are pretty bad, then you might like this cd. But if you are a fan of the 80's and the amazing music it produced, then buy other collections and don't waste your money on this schlock!!!!",1
Bought this camera for Christmas. Had her open it first so she could film the nights party & NO TAPES ARE INCLUDED! Of course all stores are closed Christmas day so the thing is USELESS until the day after. Shame on Sony. How much would a tape included in the packace cost them ? Not included Battery chargers are ....,1
"If you purchase this data cable, you need to know that you will receive no real directions or information regarding what to check if nothing works. As directed, I downloaded all of the files from the SE site (70MB on dial up!), and then downloaded all of the user guides. Everything seemed to install ok, but nothing would make my phone be recognized. After that I scoured the SE site for troubleshooting info on their branded cable-in the hope that something would help me figure out the problem. After 2 full days of beating my head against the wall, I finally threw the cable and the useless CD that came with it in the trash.If I had used my brain I would have paid the extra $$ for a SE branded cable and software (and the support that comes along with that). I now have the real deal (SE data cable and software), and guess what? Yep, installation was a breeze and it works beautifully. You really do get what you pay for.",1
"An embarassment. Steer clear of this one folks. Just when you thought these guys were the last real ""fusion"" types about...Since when did the last great secret of the fusion world start taking pointers from Joe Satriani and listening to old Al DiMeola pratice sessions? Where the hell is Phil when you need him, oh yes, Tarzan. The star is for the Bruford and Wilding/Bonus tracks, and well does one really want those?",1
"Molly Myers, in her review of ""My Name is Rachel Corrie,"" describes the ISM as ""an organization dedicated to non-violence."" This is radical left-wing propaganda: ISM offices have regularly been used to hide terrorists and their weapons, ISM ""pacifists"" regularly throw rocks at IDF soldiers, and they're perfectly willing to use violence in order to sabotage the wall intended to keep ""innocent Palestinians"" from murdering Israelis.So please disregard Molly's reviews; they are biased in the extreme.",1
"These are the handful of tracks we hear over and over again. It's far from complete though.Missing such memorable tracks as ""sealed Door"", ""wings across time"" or ""At the Bottom of the Night"".It doesn't have a single battle theme accept the final boss.Hell this doesn't even have Lucca's theme and she's on the cover!Had I seen a track-list beforehand I wouldn't have bought this.I blame my self for not being more curious of the number of CD's.I'm sorry I paid $35 dollars American for this travesty, may Lavos have mercy on my soul.Save your selves(and your money) while you still can!",1
You get what you pay for. This pillow is stiff and smelled like drying paint for 4 days. I thought I was getting a non name brand version of the Temperpedic pillow. I bought the real pillow for my mother years ago and paid many times the price. This thing doesn't even come close.,1
"The pillow I received is nothing like the one in the picture. The pillow that I received is approx half the size (in thickness) as the one I received. I am not happy with the seller (Moshelle's). I will never purchase from this company ever again. I am currently deployed Military and I feel that this company is very disrespectful and does not show it's Military members the proper courtesy when dealing with such issues. Do not buy this pillow, you will not be satisfied.",1
I have been used this product for many years. But somehow the product I received this time is like fake one. It's very thin. I have to used double amount.,1
"I suppose if you were going to sit in the same room and have line-of-sight with the device, lamp, etc. plugged into this control, it might work. Maybe. But I had it completely within the stated range and one basic house wall separating me and the unit, and it was completely unreliable.I'd recommend spending a touch more money and getting a higher quality product.",1
"What am I reviewing here... this gizmo or the supplier, Eforcity? I never received this product after my order! After waiting and waiting I contacted Eforcity several times -- no reply. After a nasty letter from me Eforcity'r reply feigned lacking information about my mailing address!What a cop-out.I told them I would not pay for it, so Eforcity said they'd give me a refund, which has not come to me yet. I bought another product to replace this from Amazon which arrived quickly from Amazon.",1
It worked about 40% of the time when I was standing less than two feet from the outlet. When I moved eight to ten feet away it worked about 5% of the. I would not recommend it.,1
"I never write reviews but I just felt compelled after I saw this video. It's 70% listening to parents and kids think about Thomas and maybe 30% Thomas related. What is worse is that you have to fast forward through a bunch of the rambling in order to see what amounts to a 5 minute story. And, there is only one song in the ""Sing A Long"". I really liked Thomas stories after watching them on PBS with my daughter. Next time, I will try to find those stories on video. They actually last about 15 minutes and do not involve mindless prattle from people I don't know.",1
"Unless I missed something, there are only one or two actual episodes on this DVD. The rest is a long commercial for the Thomas the Train centers and an ode to Ms. Allcroft. Waste of money.",1
"My 2 year old son is huge Thomas fan. This DVD has long introductions to each story in which children and adults are interviewed - my son couldn't care less. He just wants to see trains! We have a portable DVD player, and it is a big pain to try to fast forward past these introductions, and he (and I) just ends up frustrated. My advice - pick another DVD.",1
"Did not like the pants at all, and threw them in the trash rather than pay return postage. Flimsy, smelled of dye, cheap fabric, etc. Too bad.",1
"Merchant was out of stock on the second pair of pants, so when it was shipped I was charged $9 again when the second pair was in stock weeks later.Will not buy from Amazon vendors again.",1
"This is one of the worst written books I have ever read.I wish I had saved my money and my time.The book is full of superlatives. Everything is ""the best ever experienced"" again and again.The characters NEVER become embraceable. One male character is pathetic while the other is a jerk. The female lead is portrayed as perhaps innocently unaware, but is really just stupid. Her friend is promiscuous, which is all we ever really get to know of her.The writing is at a level well below that of an adult reader. But, the content could not possibly be meant for a younger reader. Very inappropriate.Not sure who would really like this book.Maybe someone who really likes descriptions of food and does not care about plot, story development, characterization or any other facets of literature.Find yourself something with a little more substance, and I think you'll be much happier.",1
cash money records is going to have to up with something a lil better than this if they plan on making it in this game.the beats where alright but the rappers a terrible.none of the have a goog flow to accomidate the beats.try again cmr.maybe next time.,1
"ALL I WILL SAY IS THIS WAS A GREAT RELEASE WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT IT AND I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT A FOUR, BUT AFTER HAVING HEARD JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ TODAY (SEPT. 30, 1999) FOR THE FIRST TIME (NOTE: YES, I KNOW I'M LATE LISTENING TO JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ) I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH MANIE FRESH AND JUVENILE. JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ IS THE BEST CD SINCE SNOOPS'S DOGGYSTYLE AND DRE'S CHRONIC. BUT THIS CD IS NOTHING COMPARED TO JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ! IF YOU DON'T HAVE 400 DEGREEZ, GO BUY THAT ONE INSTEAD OF THIS!",1
This is what is in the dictionary under wack. I can't belive that this many people bought this (...) The hot boys are just a fad like bellbottoms. (...) If you think this is what rap is about u just plain stupid and I'm glad this hot boy stuff is almost over wit. When some of my friends play this crap in the car I just rather get out and walk.,1

"I got this throat spray in a hurry hoping to relieve my 3.5 yo daughter from a bad sore throat. It tastes awful, and it's just not meant for a young child. I got it after a recommendation from another mom, and it was a bad decision. I'll keep it to numb a scratched-up knee or elbow.",1
"I listened to the audio version of ""Cruel & Unusual"" on a recent trip to New Jersey and back. The first 2/3 of the book kept me on the edge of my seat, then... the whole thing collapsed in a heap at the end. Would have been much better if the author had stuck to writing a taut thriller instead of trying to drag in everything from evil Republican office holders to Nazi war criminals, all dumped into the mix at the last possible moment. After all the buildup, the ""who"" of the whodunnit ends up being... nobody in particular. And the fate of the evildoer? Nothin' much. Disappointing. Won't bother with Dr. Scarpetta or Ms. Cornwall again.I'm a little baffled by all the reviews that say, ""great book, bad ending..."" and still give it 3 stars or more. Isn't a mystery DEFINED by the ending, by how the author ties up all the loose ends and red herrings?",1
"In a word, Lacking. Her style of writing left me unable to appreciate the underlying story which, as a result, I found rather vacuous and inauthentic. So much so that I felt compelled to come write a review of this book so others might avoid making the same mistake I did. No offence Patricia.",1
"This movie was not only NOT funny, but it was excruciatingly boring. I think Adam was channeling the Aristocrats. Whilst Aristocrats was not as funny as it thought itself to be, it was still better than this garbage.",1
Entertaining in places but spoilt by lots of crudeness and dirty talk that degrades woman. In the end I found nothing memorable or funny about this film. Sad for Adam to seem him in such a trashy film.,1
"I used to enjoy Sandler's movies but this one is just....jeez, how to put it? Well, UNFUNNY.All characters are if not stupid, shallow and egotistical...Don't care how 'dramatic' was this supposed to be, his misogynistic prick persona is the worst ever. Just, don't watch it, really...You'll want those minutes from your life back.",1
"I should have known going into this movie having Judd Apatow a part of it would mean I would hate it. However, having Adam Sandler in it and seeing the previews in the theater we gave it a (very hopeful) chance. The movie loses it's true premise of having depth in amongst the terrible & crude ""jokes"". I have to say we didn't make it more than 30 minutes into the movie before turning it off. It is a constant barrage of pathetic behavior. I just don't believe that there are this many people out here that are like this and can relate to this behavior. Very Disappointing.",1
"I seriously did not expect a dramatic look into the mind of a comedian when I rented this movie. They marketed this movie like the Forty Year Old Virigin and Knocked Up! When I rented the movie I expected a lot of humour and with so many funny actors I put way too much faith in it. My wife and I was so disappointed that we stopped watching it. I don't watch a lot of TV, but when I do watch something I want it to be worth while.If you're into these artsy films about the serious life of people in the spotlight, then you're going to like this film. However, if you're looking for humour like Adam Sandler's previous films (i.e. Happy Gilmore, etc) then you can forget about it.I give this film 1 star because this is not my kind of movie and it was advertised like a great comedy film not drama film. :/",1
This is one of the worst movies I have seen. The dialogue is awful. There is ZERO humor. All the characters are boring and completely humorless.What a loser movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
"Anything with Adam Sandler in it is supposed to be funny. This however, just, well, wasn't. I really do believe that this movie had potential, but there was so much going on, so many stories within the story, that they could have made 3 movies out of it.It's 2 and a half hours long. That's about an hour and a half too long for the main story plot. This movie honestly seemed longer than Titanic, or Gone With The Wind because it is so long and drawn out.There is very little humor in Funny People. The only good thing about it is all the major stars that pop up here and there, which is probably why, in my opinion at least, that this movie even made it to the big screen and didn't go straight to DVD.",1
A truly great example - of how terrible some movies have become!! Vulgar!! Offensive. Unnessisary nudity!! I usually love Adam Sandler - and can't believe he'd stoop so low in this role. Seth is highly likeable in this - but still swears and lowers himself as well. The woman who plays Adams 'romantic interest' is mostly great - but also stoops to swearing - blantant sexuality. The writing is the worst in this movie. This awful movie is 2 hours and 22 minutes long - but only feels like 5 hours. - And I could have spent my life doing something more interesting and exciting like watching paint dry or grass grow. I suggest skipping this movie altogether!! Tragic where movies have gone to. Much has been lost!!Scott MacNeil - comedian.,1
Honestly if you don want to hear a lot of swearing you wont like this. Let alone the story line was ridiculous. Wouldn't recommend!,1
"I normally love Sandler's movies but this was just horrible. None of it flowed right, jokes were horrible vand stupid and just all around made no sense. Don't waste your time and money on this.",1
I must say I never liked Adam Sandler. There were so many more talented people who just never got a chance to be on the screen. I still don't get what's with Adam Sandler.Besides that I decided to give it a shot. It took half hour when I stopped watching.,1
How can anybody even smile with the kind of garbage Adam Sandler ALWAYS performs?This guy is just a moronic retard.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON HIM.,1
"This movie was not an original concept. The jokes were lame, as were the performances. The writer and director disappointed the audience by using Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill as a box office draw. When in fact, it wasn't worth the money to see this film in a theatre.",1
"Save your money. Your time can be MUCH better spent. This was one of the worse movies I ever sat through. Actually, I drifted away close to the end and was thankful I didn't waste that time. Its AWFUL.",1
Not worth the time.Pros: there were several good one-liners; introduced me to new comediansCons: excess foul language; adultry;,1
"This is a nasty, mean-spirited book that exhibits contempt for the Torah and Torah values. When I picked up this book at the local library, I assumed that I would just love it and want to buy a copy for my college-age daughter (who is also a cat-owning Rabbi's daughter). But this isn't just some loveable cat regaling us with home-spun, and potentially Torah-based wisdom. No, this cat uses bad language, is obsessed with masturbation and, on occasion, likes to grab the nearest lady cat and ""show"" her (and us, unfortunately) a thing or two. (Anyone for cat pornography?) Oh, and the lovable rabbi ends up desecrating Shabbos (the Sabbath) and eating trefe (non-kosher) food in a crisis of faith brought on by finding out that his daughter's new husband is not strictly observant and his family is not at all observant. Warning: this book is not suitable for children!",1
"This is the tale of a kindly Rabbi, his sweet daughter and the cat who loves her. The tale seems promising at first, until it delves into bitterness over God and those who love Him and follow His laws. The cat represents the glorification of sin itself, and delights whenever the book's characters fall into ungodly habits, judging them forever as hypocrites (taking no account into repentance and future avoidance of said sin). As is the case with most humanist literature the story down spirals from that point until it ends with the Rabbi losing faith in God. At this point the cat is truly happy with the Rabbi, thus giving the tale a 'happy ending'. In short, 'The Rabbi's Cat' is a tale structured to appeal to secular humanists, atheists and pagans who want to feel better about their self-serving, do as you feel, lifestyles.One more note: This book, despite the beautiful artwork and appealing cover, is definitely not appropriate for children.",1
"As someone who is interested in different cultures, I thought the book would be an interesting window into other people's thoughts. Instead, I open it to find a swearing cat (he uses the F word) denigrating religion and showing religious people as hypocrites, in a lame stereotypical way. Might be interesting to others, but its not interesting to me. Not only is it not suitable to children, but there are a lot of adults who would not want to be bothered with this kind of disrespect and vulgarity either. I wish I had been warned before I tried to read this book.",1
"Jean Hill's story changed with the wind. She saw next to nothing during the assassination, but used her unique location (and her active imagination)to keep herself in the limelight for years. It got so bad that even the conspiracy writers were shying away from her toward the end. It was laughable.Someone needed to ask her about the ""little dog"" she said was sitting in the car with JFK and Jackie. (Look at the original interviews- she actually said it.)This book is BS from stem to stern. Go read a fairy tale, at least there's a moral at the end. The only thing you find at the end of this book is your wallet a little lighter!",1
"This DVD was entiled ""Seventh Cliburn Competion, 1985"" It was not the competion program, and did not even contain the winning performance. I consider it to be a total fraud and misrepresentation.",1
"Well, that's no fun. Honesty is the best policy, right? This was the first of Patricia's books I had the displeasure to become acquainted with. I've tried reading another of her works, but I can't get over the simplistic writing with unnecessary adjectives thrown in for no apparent reason except, perhaps, to make the sentences longer and make the reader suffer from the protracted tripe. More than that, this book failed to make me care about the characters or about the outcome of the story",1
"This could be the worst novel I have ever read. It is also the first and last Patricia Cornwell novel I will ever read. There are so many problems with this book that they cannot be listed here, so here are but three points: 1) The main character, Kay Scarpetta, is an insufferable, humorless snob. I'd never before read a novel where I hated the main character. Great job, Pat! 2) About 90% of the novel is dialogue. Very bad dialogue. But this is understandable since Cornwell cannot write prose. 3) The story is predictable and boring, and the ending is utterly ridiculous. I'm astonished that this book was ever published, let alone made the bestseller lists.",1
"This book is so unrealistic that it spoils all the fun, super killers like Temple Gault (a clone for the Satan Incarnate known as Hannibal Lecter) are more silly than super. I found all the other character two dimensional and all the ""intrigue"" regarding super computers insulting to my intelligence. Has Cornwell done better? I don't know and, after reading this, am in no big hurry to find out.",1
"At least, that's how I felt about this book, which seems only to have been published because the author has written some truly interesting previous novels. I recommend the first three books in the series. I cannot recommend this book for anything except kindling. However, not having a fireplace, I filed this under G.",1
"Noisy, crude five point vibration pad.NOT! a massager, a vibration pad!We purchased three of these and we sent back three of these!Worthless, no, worse than worthless!",1
"The authors seem unaware of the fact that theory guides our understanding. There are no ""objective"" facts, yet the authors present all their findings as such with almost no reasoning attached. This is both arrogant and ignorant. The authors display no grasp of theoretical advances in Accounting and I recommend getting a book that has a better exposition of principles as more than practice",1

"I am in my 60's and thought it would be a good time to remedy what I perceived as a gap in my education, economics. I never had a course in economics and the only book I had read was Heilbroner's Worldly Philosophers, a satisfying but very general overview as I recall. I probably read Heilbroner in the late 70's.I'm an audible subscriber and got Economics in One Lesson from them. I can only say that the book was dated, full of economic events that were referenced from WWII, and excessively polemical and rigid.I read it some time ago but it made enough of a bad impression on me that when I saw it in my suggestion list around number 250, I just had to get onto this page and say what a terrible disappointment the book was.I think the book should be retitled, Economics in One Polemic: The Shortest and Surest Way to Understand the Economics of the Late 1940's and the 1950's.",1
"If you want your faith in market forces and low taxation reinforced, this is a straightforward, but blinkered attempt to make you forget all about government regulation. Funny that west-European countries with bigger taxation and more government influence have less crime, better education, better health care, better TV programmes than the US. They also organise their politics better, so that the tax money is better spent. It did set me right on one or two points, and parts are written in a spuriously funny way, but it is too biased to be really informing . Clearly the writer has never listened to people he doesn't agree with.If you have an open mind compare this dangerous nonsense with the writings of Naomi Klein to see how unfettered capitalism works out in practice.",1
"Wow, this one is really out there. Only Any Rand and Ron Paul, who know nothing about economics, could recommend this book. For example, consider these laughable claims, that I paraphrase -The primary problem with economics as practiced is that no thought is given to the long term consequences of policies to all groups.There is no difference between supply and demand.The vast majority of economists are ignoramuses.It is all very simple; listen to me.If you can believe this stuff, read the book. You can get it online for free.",1
Started laughing in the second chapter....enjoyed the book after I realized that I wasn't going to learn anything new. It's obviously a miracle that we survived for the 65 years since it was first published.And seeing that the pending insolvency of the US was as loudly shouted in the 40's as it is now was worth the price. This book had quotes that would shame both modern day political extremes in the US.Kudos to whoever owns the copyright --- now there's economics in action.,1
I wish I had read more of the reviews to learn that this book is less about economics and more about pushing a particular political point of view. The point of view is hard right and the current recession disproves most of the economic patter. After skimming a few pages I threw it away; I didn't even want it in the house.,1
"This is propaganda, not an economics lesson. The book is full of faulty logic apparently spewed to promote a libertarian agenda. I couldn't be less happy with this purchase.",1
"Threw this book right in the trash not even a chapter into it, because I realized it is nothing but the same old recycled and obsolete right-wing drivel that we've been peppered with over and over, and that took our country to the edge of a second Great Depression. If you are a concerned American you should stay away from this book!",1
"This book was about witches and possession. I do not believe in those things. I am a Christian! I did not like this book very much at all! I don't think this is a good book for kids to be reading, because they might have nightmares. Some of the stories are hard to comprehend. But if you do like those kind of things you will enjoy this book! Thank you for reading my review.",1
I just ordered this fudge. It looked so good and seemed to be priced well I thought I would give it a try. I have looked at just about every store where we live and can not find any maple fudge. I am hoping this will taste as good as it looks. I will send another feedback after I have had my first bite. Can't wait.,1
"After trying three different sizes,I still couldn't find one that fit. I first ordered a medium and it wouldn't even come close to hooking so I went up to size to xlarge which was waaay to big, my last possible option would be a large and it was still huge, wish I would have sent it back but was just tired of the whole process and kept it. The hooks are a pain as well and it is way over priced.....there is a zippered option on amazon that is much cheaper.",1
"I've been wearing the waist clincher for the last two years. I purchased a new one recently and it's not the same type of material of the previous ones i've brought. I thought maybe because i had lost weight, so i brought a smaller sizer, but that one didn't fit the same either. I thought i found a miracle when i first purchased the girldle through Amazon, but i have found my recent purchase has surely let me down...",1
"I ordered according to the size chart for my measurements and it was way to small!! Very uncomfortable.I returned it,",1
"The Sizes run really small, It flips up even though, they said it would not and the hooks don't hold. I am very dissapointed.",1
"I think this product provided a great fit. I was able to hook on the first row by myself within about 5 mins max. It wasn't quite as difficult to get on as I thought it might be, although it isn't particularly easy either. I tried it on and wore for about 2 hours, and then the 2nd time I wore it had it on for about the same period of time. I took it off and one of the metal boning pieces had popped through and was hanging out at the bottom. This product is far too expensive to have something like that happen. The fit on me was snug, but I am sure I had the correct size. Now I have to figure out how to get this resolved.",1
"It was really easy to put the Squeem on, but once it was on I couldn't wait to get it off!! It wasn't too tight or anything. The problem was that once I stood up straight it bunched up in the hip/mid back area and pinched my skin! It was so painful! No matter how I positioned it, it would bunch up! Really disappointed since it was a waste of $50..",1
I really wanted this item to work because everybody seemed to love it. It didn't hold anything in on me and it gave me back boobs. Waste of money for me.,1
"I washed it before used it for the first time. The next day I wore it, I found my skin were itchy all over place on my stomach. And I feel that the heat on my body trapped on that.",1
"I ordered this product to slim down my stomach. I was looking for something I could wear all day with my jeans as well as underneath my dresses. I wore the squeem to work occasionally and then I would take it off when I got home. When I would take it off, I felt sore around my sides and my back, I washed the squeem several times and even wore it on the other side thinking this would help but it didn't. One night after work me and some of my coworkers went out for drinks so I ended up keeping the squeem on for about 14hours instead of my normal 9 hours. That night when I took the squeem off I had blisters and bruising on my side and back which have now left black marks (I'm black)on my body. I read other review before I purchased the squeem and I didn't see anything that alerted me not to buy it. Not sure why this happened but if you read this and it happens to you don't say I didn't warn you!",1
"The Squeem is a great idea, but their quality is second rate, and their customer service is worse than useless. I'd owned mine for about 4 weeks and worn it only a few hours a day when I noticed that a seam was coming unstitched. The threads aren't frayed; they're unstitching from the seam.Contacting customer service has been an exercise in futility. They've asked for pictures of the damage, and then failed to respond to the pictures, or any further attempts to contact them.For what this costs, it needs to last longer than 4 weeks.",1
So according to the size chart on the box size small is for waistline 28-31my waist is 28 so i got the smallit does not even come close to being able to close and clasp!maybe it's just me but i am terribly disappointed,1
Usually a size XS to S but this girdle's small did not fit true to size. Had to return back to Amazon.,1
"It's pretty awesome for such a price! It definitely gives you great posture, I was sitting up straight like no other! although i wish they could improve on the rubber smell otherwise it's wonderful!^^^^^ was my review when i had it for 15-20 days, now-- after ordering it on Jan, 21, 2012-- it's SO useless. I've washed it with care, it smells like rubber, and it's pretty nasty. I'd rather pay $$$ and buy something that works the way it should.",1

"As most people readers know, Jack Higgins has written many fine action-packed books. However, this book reads like a twelve-year-old wrote it. The characters are so transparent they could be ghosts.The author and his publishing house must really need the money to rip of the public in this manner. This is the last book I read by this author. One can only rest on his laurels for so long. I'm glad this book was handed down to me or I would have written a really nasty review.",1
"Where did the real Jack Higgins go? This is not only Higgin's worst effort to date, it is probably the worst book I've read in the past 5 years. (Can you say 'lazy', Jack?)I can't believe I actually finished it, and one star is a generous rating. Unbelievable chapter after unbelievable chapter, no character or plot development, written like a 5th grader.The end of the book foretells a sequel...a book that I will immediately pass on. Probably my last Higgins book without reading the reviews first.Don't buy it -- don't borrow it -- don't read it.",1
This book is not well written and leaves nothing to the imagination. If I hadn't bought it in hard cover and spent the money I would not even have finished reading it.,1
"Very simplistic writing style- he said, she said, then he said, then she said. This reads like a first attempt, not like a book written by a seasoned author of over 30 books.",1
"I'm so glad that this was not my first Jack Higgins novel. If it were, it would also be my last.Normally, I can forgive Higgins his cliche's and his obsessive attention to his characters' drinking habits, because his characters are fun and interesting. He puts them in great plots and pulls the reader happily through them, and you can't wait to find the next book especially if it's got Sean Dillon.But not this one. All the characters are wooden. The action is colorless and completely unbelievable. A president guarded only by one secret service agent and a dog? A professional assassin who whacks his target on the head and then shoots someone else?There is no sense of timing or place, only the thinnest of motivations for most characters, and no justification for many of the decisions made by characters.This book is amateur hour. Don't bother. Read some of Higgins's earlier works instead.",1
"This is by far his worst effort that I've read. He's not my favorite spy author,anyway. This book feels like it had been written to fulfill a publisher's contract or obligation that Mr. Higgins had assumed and needed to finish in a hurry. The characters are not at all fleshed out, and the story line is too contrived. I would advise not wasting time by reading this book.",1
"I had the rare experience of giving up on a novel after only a couple of chapters when trying to read Edge of Danger recently, but Higgins managed to pen a book so lame that I refused to go any further. His bad guy is supposedly a Scottish-Arabian aristocrat but comes off as just another cartoon Arab terrorist with an implausible, pointless heritage. But, what do you expect from a middle-aged author who poses in bomber jacket and aviator glasses on the dust jacket.... depth?",1
"Given the lack of character development, or rather, simplistic and at times contradictory character development; the lack of any plot whatsoever; and poor visualizations; I can't believe I read the whole book. I guess I kept waiting for the action to start. It never did.",1
"Very few books contain their own review. This one does:""Stone said, 'It really is like a bad movie, Harry.'""'You can bleeding well say that again. . . .'""This book reads like a 7th grade reading-level condensation of an outline of a screenplay: The paragraphs are no more than a few lines long; very few words greater than two syllables are used. No complex thoughts, no character development, no suspense, and little description. Pure formulaic twaddle.",1
"The plot is not believable, there is not a shred of character development, and there isn't even any descriptive atmosphere. It shocks me that Jack Higgins and the publishers actually make money off of this puerile drivel. I shall not buy any more of his efforts.",1
The style of writing leads me to believe that Higgins was under pressure to churn out a book to meet some editor's deadline. There was no character development. Critical turns in the plot and action were blown through without the slightest bit of suspense. I've never read Higgins before and likely will never read him again.,1
"A terrible, childishly written book with absolutely NO redeeming value as literature. Higgins loves to ""speak Irish"" but even that gambit fails in this trite, poorly plotted, worthless endeavour by a writer who should remain retired if he can't do any better than such trashy writing.",1
"I don't know who is worse- Higgins or Macnee. The plot is so tranparent you can guess what is coming next. Completely implausible. Macnee's narration is so overdone it is laughable. Most of the time the characters do little more than quaff enormous amounts of Bushmills Irish Whisky. A real stinker. Wayne Schwartz, Los Angeles, CA",1
"I bought this CD for one song only, ""Steal Away"". I knew it was going to be ""live"", but this isn't even close to the radio version. Try more like a ""muzik, lounge"" sound. It was recorded in a ballroom. Then, the only other song I recognized was ""Hot Rod Hearts"", again, done the Vegas lounge style. I wish I could get my $$ back. Why didn't he just put out the CD using the regular recordings? He was never a big star to begin with. I wrote this review just to warn people that it isn't like most ""live"" recordings. I was very dissapointed, and I still don't have a decent recording of ""Steal Away""!",1
"Hawthorne's use of symbolism throughout the book is undeniable, yet his obvious alcoholism takes over as the underlying factor present at all points. He relies on ambiguity far too often without the build up to a climax. The climax(es) happened before the book started and only happened to a select few who read this book. Read Atlas Shrugged, Anthem, or virtually anything by Aldous Huxley if you want some entertainment.",1
"This product requires a stereo player in which the balance is turned totally to the left. Most auto systems have that capability. However if you have Dolby or SurroundSound, it can be difficult (and maybe impossible) to play the cassette without hearing two recordings at the same time. Unfortunately neither the packaging nor the website will warn you of the problem. You therefore should think before buying. Once you have opened the packaging you may be unable to return the product.",1
"I will never understand how ""Classics"" become Classics. So far for school i Have had to read far to many Classics. Dickens should be glad he is dead and does not have to read his books because they would probably kill him out of sheer boredom...Hawthorne creates an ok tale, but really? It gets dragged out and is suppose to be realistic. Then he throws Pearl in there, she is like some super-human and belongs in fantasy. I never really did believe in the whole 'they completely ostracized her but let her stitch everything.' That is just a bit hypocritical, either she was excepted as prat of the society *which she was not) or she wasn't (which she almost was. See that just doesn't make any sense. The story is suppose to show how unforgiving the society was, but it doesn't. It is better than Dickens, but then again everything is.",1
"I teach high school English, and was required to teach thisto my students. I don't know who suffered more, me or them.To be fair, as one of America's first novels, it has interestingelements and Hawthorne does a good job.On the other hand, it is excruciating to read. There is nosuspense, little to sympathize or empathize with, and evenless to enjoy. A better writer could have told the samestory in half the number of pages. Some have labelledthis book a tragedy; they are right only in the sense thatit is tragically bad.",1
"I don't see how this book gets so much attention as being ""one of the best novels ever."" It's very short, and very boring. It's written in old english, which adds to the difficulty, and even if you can understand it, you finish the book and say, ""Ok, so what's the point?"" There is absolutely no point to this novel. Entire chapters of the novel are void of dialogue and appears as a wall of text, and the description is so vague that you can't even tell what a character is doing half the time.",1
"This novel was the most boring book I have ever read. I would never put another person through the torture of reading this long-winded dull attempt at a scandalous and exciting romance. Even though there is much symbolism to be found, when is one supposed to find it, while they are sleeping? Another factor of my displeasure with this book is that I love to read and now hesitate to pick up another Hawthorne piece. How did this book become a ""CLASSIC""?",1
"I guess I should have read the last review or even the fact that the description says Landscape. I didn't think it was necessary, it's just a book right?I guess it's supposed to be easier to read in bed. I just thought it would be cool to have the Scarlet Letter be a red book.If you buy this book you will be holding the book like a wall calendar and reading in two columns; first the two columns on the top page and then two columns on the bottom. This just seems really irritating to me.",1
"I read this book for AP English and had to do a blue-book assignment of it. The word ""ugh"" summarizes my experience.This book was written in the 19th century, and that's where it belongs. It wouldn't be nearly as bad if someone were to modernize the language used in the book, but reading through ""dost thou"" after ""dost thou"" isn't any fun.However, I highly recommend reading Richard Armour's take on SL in his book ""The Classics Reclassified"".",1
"I've bought this book, underlined every hint of symbolism, found all evidence of romanticism, followed every quote involving thematic oppositions, and noted every example of Pearl's rebellious nature and social alienation, but I cannot find one positive aspect of this novel that makes any of my hard work feel rewarding. The only way this novel could give me a warm feeling is if I place it in a furnace.",1
I ordered a specific ISBN No. and received a different tiny book of the same with different appearence and a different ISBN No.The picture seen online is not the one that I received.,1
"This novel is absolutely awful. Although it has received over 500 reviews I feel it is my duty to help bring the average star level to where it belongs, at zero. Where to begin... perhaps with the run on sentences, the failure to create significant rising action, the flat two dimensional characters... This novel is full of things which not only bore the reader, but frustrate them as well.The fatal flaw in this piece of literature is its inability to stay relevant. Post-modern society does not really care about, ""Baby daddies,"" and the revelation which is made at the end, and beginning, of this novel is reproduced daily on morning television a la Maury. Unfortunately, Nathaniel Hawthorn you are the father of this literary disaster.",1
"I have yet to actually complete this novel. It is so dog-gone hard to understand. On top of this, I have an essay that is due: TOMORROW! Is there no relief?!",1
"I was assigned this book when I was a sophomore in high school (22 years ago). I couldn't get through it; the Cliff Notes version help me pass the test. I found it turgid and laborious reading.I graduated in the top 10% of my high school class. I have a master's degree. Despite my academic success, I don't understand why this book is a classic. I don't understand why Hester didn't just pack up Pearl and her stuff, move to another town and tell everyone she was a widow. That would have saved everyone alot of grief, especially young readers like me.",1
This is the worst book I have ever read. The attempts at symbolism are bogged down with unnecessary detail and the language is over the top even for the time period. I hurled it across the room at one point in agitation and disgust.,1
"I usually have nothing to say but good things about book I read! But this book, it does have it's interesting points but I just don't get into it. I rather would burn myself at the stake that read the remaining chapter I have to finish for my English Class. What did I have to do to deserve this? I stood there reading the book with my book in one hand and dictionary in the other, I ended up reading Chapter 9 about 10 times because the information wasn't getting to me. And the way the author addresses the reader, I want to scream. I'm sure in the 1850's this was a wonderful book because of the message it stated back then, but more than 100 years afterwards, people seem to lose interest. And the fact that they make HS students read this book is just plain homicide. STOP THE ASSIGNING OF THIS BOOK! DON'T PUT YOUR STUDENTS THROUGH TORTURE!",1
"Unless you have the correct size font, you will have a difficult time reading this book on the Kindle. It is not set up to have the text wrap correctly and therefore has a full line of text, the next line has a single word, then another full line and so on.",1
"I'll admit right up front that I am stupid. I would rather enjoy a book instead of try to find my way through the maze of confusing, endless prose that Hawthorne uses. I found myself empathizing more with Chillingworth than Dimmesdale. A book should NOT have to be dissected and disscussed to be understood!!! It should clearly portray its thematic structure without having to resort to a smokescreen of vague symbols and the word ""Classic"" stamped all over it to force people to appreciate it. Yes, it was heavily thematic and full of symbolism; and it was ""meaty"" (whatever that is), ""deep"", and ""powerful""; but it was dry, slow, and boring. Even someone as myself, who generally enjoys the classics, will fall asleep (as I did everytime I tried to read this book). Do NOT try to speed-read this. This book has no place in a high-school English course; it needs a span of several years to muddle and plod thru, and then try to unravle.",1
"I'm sure I would be able to understand the vivid descriptions and symbolism in this book much better, if Hawthorne were not writing in some sort of moon man language. I don't know about the production of narcotics in the 1800's, but I honestly think that Hawthorne wasn't on a natural high if you know what I'm saying.",1
THIS BOOK SUX! Who cares about Pearl anyways! Someone shoot me in the head before i die of boredom!!!,1
The book is boring if you try to read it without a good look at the movie first but it gets easier to understand once youre in class failing every single test your teacher gives you on it! Then she decides to explain what's going on to you later. It was boring and I fell asleep everytime I went to read it.,1
"typically, I will force myself to read even the worst books (for class, for ""fun"", because I think I should), but when I read this book for a [...] English course, I quickly realized it was one of the worst books ever (not to be taken lightly, seriously), certainly not worthy of a classic, boring, endless details that no one cares about... blah blah blah. Terrible. I was bored. It might have been too difficult for a 9th grader, but I wouldn't read it now either.on the other hand, my brother loved it.",1
"This was the worst book I ever read. I was lost and confused and that was only in the first sentence. You would think that classic had to have some level of goodness, but this book was the worst piece of filth I had ever read in my entire life. It's no wonder that Hawthorn locked himself in his mothers attic, he was mentally ill before he ever wrote the book. If you are a high school student,like I am, you know the hell that I had to go through and I am guessing you never want to put yourself through it again. And to you who have no read this book, don't. You have not, or never will commit enough sin to be put in to the type of hell that this book offers the reader. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. Oh, and by the way who decided that this was a classic romantic book, there is nothing romantic about this novel, nor anything good. If you are in the mood for a good romance shoot for Nora Roberts or Sandra Brown, they can actually write!",1
"The pain brought on by this archaicly verbose peice of literary kindling is so great that, while reading, I was greatly tempted to gouge out my eyes to prevent any future encounters with Mr. Hawthorne's ""work"". Please, for the love of all things sacred USE CLIFFNOTES!!! It will save you from years of therapy. I am scarred for live. My soul will be tormented after death and i will be forced to walk the earth in search for reconciliation.",1
"Oh man, where do i begin with this one? First of all, I want to say that a 1 star rating is flattering this novel beyond all means. The Scarlett Letter is one of the most boring pieces of junk that I have ever been assigned to read. I realize that there is a ton of symbolism in this novel, but if you can't stay awake to find it, what's the point? Also, it really helps when Hawthorne decides to use 15 letter words in each and every sentence. Only person that I would recommend this novel to is an insomnia patient. This one ranks right up there with A Tale Of Two Cities (another ""Classic"").",1
"This was one of the most boring books i've ever read. Unfortunately i did not give up on Hawthorne after reading this novel, that was a mistake. I'd pass on this one if i were you, if you must read this for school I highly suggest getting a summary online.",1
"This is probably the most confusing and worst book I have ever read! The author uses incredibly large words and you constantly have to use a dictionary or else you most likely won't know hat you are reading. From my point of view as a high school (with mostly A's and good at English) student I would not recommend this book to any other high school age students. The author needs to get to the point and not drag on for pages about things that are not important at all. Long setences also makes the book drag on. If I didn't have to read this book for a book report I would have put it down after the first page or two and usually I finish every book that I start. This book had me in tears because it was so difficult. I had to ask my English teacher to explain this to me. Read this book at your own risk, but i do not reccommend it to anyone.",1
"Three words to describe my feelings of this book...I HATE IT.Hawthorne's writings are dull, dry, and other words that mean bad that start with D. The character's a boring.",1
"This book literally put me to sleep. I could wake up at 2 in the morning and find the book in my lap, and then have to stress over finishing the assigned reading for my English class. I mean, some of the sentences are about 15 lines long, and the plot, if there is a plot, is incredibly slow. If the author would just tell it like it is, and not drag it out for pages, the book would be only about a third of the length that it is. Boring, boring, BORING!",1
"Throughout this entire book, one part of my brain was in a state of wonder, trying to imagine how anyone could make a book about scandal, sin, adultery, public shame and cowardice so dull. To finish the book was a test of will, and was accomplished because I hate to leave things undone.There are many fine, engaging, interesting novels, both of our age and of Hawthorne's. I can't imagine why one would want to slog through this one.",1
"Warning -- the two songs listed as ""Little Steve"" were written by him but are not the originals nor performed by him!",1
"Ditto to other complaints - won't separate easily- either by unscrewing or prizing. Cheap, flimsy, leaks water also because no gasket. I'm looking for something else and hoping reviewers will give honest good advice . . . this almost identical to product by Munchkin",1
"The book WAS good in its time but EVERYTHING related to traveling in this area of SE Asia, especially Laos, has changed drastically in the past three years. Frankly, a 1996 edition should be sold as remainders at about $2, then someone who wanted only info about the people or the temples could get ethnographic info only! I was in Laos this past August 1998 and most published info, except the Internet updates by an Australian in Nong Khai,Thailand, who does visas to Laos, was wrong and very outdated--especially the most important things like availability of visas and safety of bus/road travel. Real traveling info from books like this that are so old could be very misleading!",1
"This book is getting mixed reviews. It seems like friends of the author say its great. Those who tried to actually use the book are disappointed that everything is so out of date. This edition was not updated since the first edition and is now really out of date. Things change, but sloppy research is always out of style.",1
"Well, this is one of those ""you get what you pay for"" kind of reviews. Didn't pay much, didn't expect much, but basically functional would've been nice. The generator came broken (probably a miswire internally). Yep, I checked the outs with a meter... and if I finagled the probe inside and touched the right spot, I got voltage. Just not externally. Too much trouble to return it and convinced my 10-year old to go with a real light powered by batteries.",1
"this thing is nothing but s piece of junk it came broke,didnt,work i wouldnt of rated it but i had to:[DO NOT BUY THIS ITEAM-it is nothing but a piece of junk",1
"If you are adamant to watch this movie despite all the negative reviews, please do it after the Holliday season. This is the most depressing, sad, pathetic, sarcastic and cruel movie that I've ever seen in my life.Through all the movie I felt that I am going to cry and was depressed for the rest of the day. Basically it is a movie about a guy that lost his parents during his childhood, twins with serious genetic disorders and a single mom. How somebody could find it funny is beyond me.If you want to kill the Holiday spirit and get into a deep depression than this movie is perfect for you! If not - skip it.",1
Its sad that a animation that is clearly made to attract children was made with such rude humor and disrespect towards others. How this animation could be recomended for anyone is beyond me. Shame on you Adam Sandler that your ability is not used for more postive purposes.,1
"Someone I know bought this in a discount rack, thinking it was what it pretends to be -- a children's holiday cartoon. Nothing could be further from the truth. I could not believe what a disgusting piece of filth it is, full of perverted sexual innuendo. Movies like this should not be marketed toward children, and no matter what the rating, that is who they were trying to target by making it look like a children's holiday cartoon. It should be kept in the back room of video stores with the restriction that only adults could see it (and then only if they have absolutely no taste nor moral fortitude whatsoever). I can't give this as strongly negative a review as it deserves! I only gave it one star because they wouldn't let me give it none.",1
"Most likely one of the worst movies i have ever seen! I went to see this movie with about 5 or 6 friends, when it was over, we all wanted our money back! The movie is not funny at all. Believe me i love adam sandler but this isnt even a comedy, there are alot of sad parts in it, but they label it as a comedy. All this movie actually is happens to be is a fairy tale for little kids, huge waste of money. If you want to see a real adam sandler comedy wait for anger management or rent happy gilmore.",1
"This movie was terrible!""WARNING SPOLIERS MAY BE POSSIBLE!""Well it starts out with Davey, a drunk who is crude and mean. Then when he gets into trouble he's doomed to community service with the town migiet Whitney, (No offence to little people out there, that it not my intention to offend anyone). Whitney sounds like Woody Allen on crack, and his fernal twin sister Elenaor isn't any better.Well Davey does all he can to offend Whitney. That is until his place burns up! So he moves in with Whitney and his sister, and they set some ground rules. Then as the movie goes on, they make a big deal about Davey having little emotion, and when he cries it's all the sudden a big deal! And for some reason the deer in the woods talk, and help Whitney out. What or who is Whitney supposted to be Santa Claus?I hate the music in it, the voices are annoying, and the characters are mostly unlikable! So warning to parents, keep your children locked up from this totally bad movie!",1
The packaging was coming off the back of the package and the box it was in was distorted. I wanted to give this as a christmas present but it doesn't even look new!,1
"I love Adam Sandler. Well, I used to love him, before he made Eight Crazy Nights. Not only was this cartoon not funny, it was downright trash. I would not recommend this ""feature"" to anyone. ""Eight Crazy Nights"" was short on story, long on time, and wearing on patience. I kept watching in hopes that this cartoon would redeem itself; I needed some justification for wasting the 2 hours of my life that I will never get back. Needless to say, I stuck it out until the credits, and now I have to live with the facts that I: 1.) watched the movie; and 2.) I'll never get that time back. So now I sit here, typing away a review I doubt anyone will read, wasting more of my precious life on that ridiculous movie! HUMBUG! Watch ""Ishtar,"" you'll get more out of it. Oh, and I only awarded one star because Amazon insists you give everything at least one star. I did this under protest.",1
"Let me start out by saying that I enjoy Adam Sandler movies. I like Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore. Sure, they're not great films, but they've given me plenty of laughs. So when I tell you that this is one of the most dreadful movies I've ever watched, you'll know it isn't because of some bias against Mr. Sandler.This may be the worst movie ever made. It is cloying, stupid, unfunny, weird, and pathetic--in a bad way. I could go on about the awful story, the grating voices, the cliches and schmaltz, or the bad songs. (Yes, Virginia, this is a musical. The worst musical ever unleashed on film. No, I haven't seen every musical; but you don't need to in order to fully understand the depths to which this film sinks.)Don't see it. Don't buy it. Don't rent it. Don't send any signal that they should make more cr*p like this.",1
"I gave this 1 star because they wouldn't let me have 0 stars. The movie is just plain horrible. The 12 year olds in the audience enjoyed the juvenile, flatulence and other bodily function humor.

"Yeah well this movie was just terrible. Sandler tries paroding the classic cartoon musical but he fails in every way possible. I mean this is a stupid movie, one song is about how great the mall is and then another song has the logos of different stores singing to him. It's almost a marketing ploy to get people to go holiday shopping more. The film also tries to make the audience sympathize with Sandler's character but once again it fails, we have seen the Grinch and A Christmas Carol too many times to actually care about this Jewish Scrooge. This movie sucks all around with cheap gross out humor that may have worked better had it been live action but that would have defeated the purpose of the film. And one last comment, Why the hell is this a double disc DVD? All of Sandlers good and/or funny movies are singular yet this movie is terribe and it gets the extra feature treatment. This movie sucks.",1

"Why does this series need to be so much more expensive than most of the other TV shows? Especially considering these don't even have the original soundtrack. The first thing I think of when I think about My Three Sons is the great music that went along with the show, and it's missing from this way over-priced version. As much as I love My Three Sons, I will wait for the original version to be released at a reasonable price before I buy.",1
"The best things about this heavily formula vehicle are (1) Elvis' opening production numbers (including a nicely staged ""Adam And Evil""); (2) Deborah Walley's ""girl drummer"" role; (3) the Deusenberg; and (4) Elvis' closing production number, the medium walking blues ""I'll Be Back"". Everything else is redundant.",1
"Three lovely young ladies all want Elvis' gearstick in this craptastic musical comedy that's so bad it ROCKS!

And who was that chick, the blonde with the short cropped hair who literally shoves all the other chikadees aside to get up and spinout with the King? She looks like she's out to prove she can really score, and I never saw parts move like that before! Elvis looks embarrassed. Anyway, after you've crossed those double lines and Spinout you will want to do so again and again and again. Simply awful, but I mean that in a great way.",1
"This would be a nifty little contraption if it wasn't for the fact that you can't change the top -- my primary impetus for buying it.I have a Handspring Visor and lost my stylus. I didn't want to pay for shipping on a new stylus 3-pack from Handspring, so I went to Best Buy and purchased this instead. Not only can you not change the top so that it fits in the Visor properly, but now the entire headpiece falls out constantly so that the bottom part of the stylus gets stuck in the stylus-holder. Oh, and did I mention that the light function only works part of the time?Not worth your time or effort.",1

They never mensioned this one, so then again i'd advise you to stay away from this item. The Garage Inc. CD is great. I've got all the versions of it except this one.

First off, I bought it without hearing anything by them before, but it had been highly recomended to people who like Tool and Mars Volta by Amazon!! They couln't have been any more wrong. So, why did i personally find this so painfull?Well, the whole thing in general is quite painfull. First off, the musicians. The whole band sound like studio musicians. No obvious indivuality or anything new to offer. Then we get to the vocals. The closest thing I can compare them to are Alison Moyet or Anthony and the johnsons. I don't mind Anthony and the Johnsons, but this guys vocals and the music just don't rock. Which is fine. It's ok not to rock! But why the hell, being a Tool fan and Mars volta fan, was I recomended this? It's bland, it's week, and the dubby bass, boring guitar playing/sound... weak vocals.. Actually, forget it. The whole package. It is just lame.",1

"I bought this to replace the supposedly same power adapter that I purchased last year. This is NOT the same adapter as pictured for the item (I see that a customer has added two pictures of the true product). I was not concerned with this difference but would have preferred to have a light indicating the power is on. At first, it seemed to power my powerbook G4 fine, but later it started to cycle as charging and not charging, thus making the screen brighten and darken. When I shut the computer and let it charge, it did charge some, but I'm concerned about ruining my battery (which is also a replacement). It simply does not work when you are using the computer..and I'm ALWAYS using my computer! I will have to find an alternative to this product. I thought it was bad enough that the one I got last year quit working, but this is ridiculous.",1
"This product does not work with my ibook G4. As stated by some earlier reviews by other customers, the charger toggles between charging and not charging. Occasionally, if it is left on, it will continuously charge. I thought about keeping it, but it is unreliable and there are other third party options for $10 more.This one is going back to Amazon.",1
"Nice form factor etc...but bad function. Product appears to charge my Powerbook G4 12"" when it is off or asleep, but when working it cycles on and off and emits a faint buzzing sound from the brick. Try another product.",1

"I'm sure this product is great for G4 Powebooks and G3 iBooks, but nowhere in this product description does it say that this adapter is NOT for use with iBook G4s. I tried this on my iBook G4, and the computer kept switching back and forth between battery power and the power supply from the adapter. I'm returning this to Amazon tomorrow, but am upset that I wasted $20 overnighting this adapter because I absolutely need to use my computer this weekend. I wish they would update the product description to make it explicit that this is for Powerbook G4s and iBook G3s ONLY.",1
"I'm now on my third charger for my Powerbook (my dad says I'm rough on equipment). Let me tell you, the Macally is NOT it. Like others, it fluctuates between charging and battery every 1-2 seconds and the brick makes weird squeaky noises. After not having a computer for a week and being so relived to finally get this charger, I was almost in tears to find that it is a piece of crap. It charges when the computer is off or in sleep mode, but that's not going to cut it. If you have a Powerbook G4, don't waste your money on this.",1
"I purchased this adapter to replace another PS-AC4 that worked for about 18 months before going belly up. This one lasted two weeks. I called MacAlly and quickly got an RMA number, then I overnighted the defective item to them. That was ten days ago, and I'm still waiting for the replacement to arrive.",1
"I plugged this item into my laptop and nothing happened. No power- nothing.When I unplugged this adapter the negative metal ring from the plug stayed lodged inside of my computer, I had to remove it with needle nose pliers.I had to call the company 5 times before getting a rep on the phone as I was continually placed in automated limbo for about 15 per call. The rep actually admitted to me that this happens alot because the rings are too small and fit to tight in the computers.I was really looking forward to saving some dough. But this adapter was surprisingly worse the the original that came with the computer.They are sending me return authorization.",1
"We ordered the Macally PS-AC4 power adapter and received an entirely different product from a differnt comany. As noted by other Amazon shoppers we received th Inspire M8482. This adapter is differnet in the following ways..instead of the 10'cord with a velcro wrapper, it has a short cord that leavesthe transformer hanging from the input of your computer. This will ultimately break the DC connection from the board..this is not repairable. Their is no led power light as advertised leaving you wondering if it is on. It is clearly a cheap knck off and we are taken for idiots who might not recognize that. I am mad! I just went through a similar thing with Overstock. Months of emails, calls and waiting on hold...for a grain of satisfaction. It is insulting to think that these big companies have so little respect for us!",1
"I too have the same problem most recent reviewers have had: when I plug the charger in, it cycles between charging and not charging every two seconds. The computer doesn't end up charging.In addition, the version I have doesn't look like the picture on the Amazon web site, and doesn't have the power LED.Clearly there is an epidemic of defective chargers. And we, the customer, have to go to the hassle of obtaining a return authorization and sending it back.I notified the seller. I am also going to notify Amazon to research this topic, and take the product off the site until they can resolve the issue. Other than this charger, my experience with Amazon has been exemplary.I strongly suggest that if you too have bought one of these chargers and have had trouble with it, please post here.",1

"This is one of the most poorly designed and implemented chargers around. I own a 15"" Powerbook G4 (which this is listed as being compatible with).The problem is that this isn't actually a 65watt power cord... so don't expect to use your computer while it's charging... and don't expect to be able to touch the ""brick"" as it's plugged in, you'll burn yourself.I've returned this item and got a charger from another company for just a few dollars more that works a TON better.",1
Macally is a terrible company. NOT worth the money you save. I recently bought a power cord thru them that emits an electrical current thru my computer. They will only send me a replacement but won't give me my money back. Not worth the risk. Buy Mac!Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4,1
"Everything the other reviews say about this product is largely true: the cord is thicker and more durable than the Apple adapter, the brick doesn't get as unnervingly hot, you can deal with the fact that it's not powerful enough to be used as a power source... but one day it just mysteriously stops working. I bought this to replace my broken Apple adapter and was generally very pleased with it, but about a month later I went to plug it in one day and it just wouldn't work. My laptop showed no connectivity, the little charge light on the brick didn't go on, and after tinkering with the thing at length I couldn't get anything to change. If you want a cheap, temporary replacement charger, I guess this would be fine. But for anything long-term it might just be worth shelling out $80 for something that at least lasts a year or two.",1
Don't buy!!! This charger does not work. It broke twice before Amazon told me they would not send me another. The customer service was excellent from Amazon.,1
"This product is advertised to work with the iBook G4, but it does NOT.This plug looks fine, but despite what the product description stats, it isn't compatible with the 3- to 5-year-old version of the 12-inch iBook G4, which I own and now must buy yet another plug for after this one didn't work.Consider yourself warned.",1
"Out of the difficult to open package, this adapter worked for a couple of days.I missed the light on the end of the standard Apple adapter (yellow for charging, green for charged).But the price was right, until, it started cycling on and off. The Mac screen would dim and brighten dim and brighten. Boy, was I glad to notice that the on screen battery light was cycling between a/c and battery. Unplugged the Macally, computer ran fine on just battery. Runs fine on the Apple charger I had left at home.The good news is the return to Amazon was extremely easy, presuming the lack of destroyed packaging doesn't void my refund.I've ordered a different brand (with light!). This one may have just been a bad example. I've had good luck with other Macally gear.",1
We plugged this on only to have it spark and not power our ibook G4. It went back the next day.,1
"This product would intermittently charge my computer, charging about half of the time and not charging the other half. It has 3 1/2 stars as an average from so many reviews because you get exactly what you pay for with this one - a cheap alternative.I was happy with the first one I bought. It lasted about a year and a half with heavy use. I thought I'd try another one but odds are you'll end up with a defective one of you buy a few of them.",1
"Like every other Mac user, I think the replacement power cord with the bulky, cumbersome block is overpriced and less than durable, so I decided to outsource. What I got was never quite up to speed, but since my laptop mostly stays plugged in, the quick charge wasn't a must. Unfortunately, after a scant 8 months, with very little movement or unplugging (I've packed up my laptop for travel exactly twice in that time), the power cord has given out. There seems to be a short between the wires, with the hazardous side effect of causing random sparking at the connection between the computer plug-in and the wire. Needless to say, I'm not going back to this product!",1
"This performance is pure garbage. Unfortunately I was at this pathetic show. The audience was mostly old geezers who were there to watch a group of other geriatric has-beens. The sound was awful, their performance of West Side Story was ridiculous, and their hatred for America was sad. Halfway through the show, the singer was having serious trouble hauling his fat *ss around the stage. He sounded like an exhausted pig, gorging himself at the trough. It was bad enough that they would embarrass themselves by performing in front of people, but they actually recorded their disaster. Now they think they can sell this crap??",1

"These DVDs are great - if you're only a minor fan of DURAN DURAN, but as a major fan of Simon and the boys; I felt neglected. If you're looking for lots of great extras - don't bother. They really didn't need to take up two discs with as little as they give you. The videos on the DVDs ARE their greatest hits, just don't expect much more(like their stuff from the 90's) so buy the set if you're a fan - because that's what we're stuck with for now.",2

"This is a very incomplete videography. Some gems are missing: ""Nightboat"", ""Careless Memories"",""Lonely In Your Nightmare"", ""My Own Way"", etc. Why bother to release a product that is obviously ""less that we expected"". Very bad marketing or a cheap attempt to re-release later with all the videos, so that we'll have to buy it twice. The first three records were remastered lately with no extra singles at all and now we have this dvd that could have had everything instead of giving us 25 versions of ""New Moon on Monday"". Really weird!Why bother to put ""hidden"" videos when it is written on the sleeve. It is just annoying not to have them on a regular menu.EMI should have take example on the ""Best of Bowie"" dvd which is a good example of a well-done product that respect the fans.",2
"Using the ""hidden easter eggs"" to see the remaining videos is gimmicky and useless. If you're having trouble finding them, simply use the ""Title"" selection feature on your dvd player and enter each number one at a time to cycle through everything (the first disc has 38 titles). The picture quality is shoddy. It is ridiculous not to have included ALL of their videos. Be warned: the 30 minute interview, lyrics, etc. are DVD-ROM only. It would have been cool to have had the band offer commentary on these groundbreaking (at the time) clips, but nothing. What would have been welcome are the concert film, ""Sing Blue Silver"", and the concept film, ""Arena"". The 18 minute ""New Moon On Monday"" is a nice surprise. Otherwise, buy at your own risk.",2

"Besides grammatical mistakes and obvious errors in translation, the book doesn't delve deep into the places it promises, and concentrates on analogies that play to the lay-est of laymen rather than focusing on the actual data and theories of neural networks. Chapters on neuroplasticity and feedback are worthwhile, but the book quickly derails onto a scene of neuroscientific generalism, which seems to be the popular fad among most brain books today, which seem to pass around the same cache of information on L-Dopa, homunculi, and Aplysia to take up a good 25% of 75% of the books in print. Good for an introduction to neural nets and semantic networks, but not a valuable reference.",2
"I bought this set because of the rave reviews that went with it. And, because I had this snatch of memory from when I was young that I had wanted to buy this. Truthfully everyone, it's a disappointment. I have listened to it several times and while there are certainly songs that I like, and this is Clapton without all of the ""maturity"", the harmonies are usually bad (just shy of awful in some cases), the music does go on and it does, in hindsight, seem that they are in love with the new wa-wa pedal, amongst other sound enhancers.I know, Clapton's God. But, I'm an agnostic. Slowhand is great, and the young years are better than most of the older years for originality, but it's not smooth, if that's what you need from a CD.",2
"Boring, bloated, overlong, repetitive half-baked arrangements of Clapton classics made even worse by Bobby Whitlock's horrible, intrusive over-the-top ""backup"" singing.2 stars for some nice guitar solos and drummer Jim Gordon's amazing work, but it is not worth the 29 dollars. Better you should buy ""Wheels Of Fire"" or ""Eric Clapton's Rainbow Concert"" or ""Layla.""Pass.",2
"Interesting plot, I thought as I watched the trailer. Found it predictable and boring, most of the time. Could have been much better.",2
"I didn't like this movie. It was a waste of time. I thought it was stupid and ridiculous not to mention confusing. Hard to keep the all the lives straight, who was with who, etc.",2
"Paltrow is such a good actress, but even her brilliance couldn't save this film. Good story but bad script and poorly cast leading man with whom Paltrow had no chemistry. If you can't buy their relationship, the whole movie falls apart.",2
"This would have gotten 3 stars from me if it weren't for the miserably cheesy ending... and maybe even 4 if you cut down the length. It may deserve more than 2 stars when compared to the usual Hollywood claptrap, but nothing convinced me this was a story worth telling... or viewing.",2
"An original story idea that was watered down by a lackluster script, bland acting and unlikable characters. Not even Hollywood's golden girl paired with a snappy new hairdo and a bottle of peroxide could add the necessary zest.With the exception of Helen and her female friend, all of the characters were repulsive and had no redeeming qualities. The film portrays John Hannah's character as 'Mr. Right,' even though he's deceived Helen all along by failing to mention a certain something about himself (I won't spoil the ending). Even his explanation doesn't get him off the hook, because he still lied and deceived her.Also, I could understand the use for Paltrow's accent in Shakespeare In Love and Emma, but was it really necessary in this movie?",2

This was our 1st Robert Tanenbaum's novel. We found we were waiting for the suspense as the title would suggest. We found it rambling on at times and hard to pick up. Maybe we have to read the previous Karp/Ciampi series and it would let us to get to know the characters better instead of just jumping in like the middle of a movie and try to guess who is who. The title and brief summary captured our attention then we felt let down by the end.,2
"I love Tales of the City and I wish they would reissue a DVD set that actually works. I can not even watch it to the end. Like others, the DVD starts to constantly freeze and I have a very good DVD player. I think customers should be aware that this set is flawed and they will not get what they paid for: A DVD that actualy works. Very disappointing.",2
"We were not impressed by this toy. It is a great concept for the bathtub toys, but it's hard for even an adult to make a basket in the small square opening.",2
I bought 2 sets of these for my boys for Christmas and they are really a net idea. The problem is that the hoop is VERY heavy and doesn't stick to the wall. It constantly falls down and the boys get really frustrated. I end up holding it for them (so much fun for me). The balls are fun and cute (and easy for little hands to squeeze) but the hoop is really a piece of trash. There are better bath toys out there- save your money!,2
"I very much enjoyed the American version of Sunset Blvd., but the original London version doesn't do much for me. It contains the original (and no longer current) versions of many of the songs, leaving the material with a ""score"" lacking the polish it received when it arrived in America. There are, however, subtle but tantalizing hints of what the show would eventually become. But it is the cast that is the reason to not buy this 2-disc set. Unless you want to hear Kevin Anderson trying to act and sing at the same time, Daniel Benzali sing a role in the wrong range, and Patti LuPone miscast more than just any other actress in musical theatre history, skip it and buy the far superior Glenn Close/Alan Campbell version instead.",2
"This movie certainly has great actors in it, and they did a good performance, but I didn't really care for the story. I would not recommend this movie too highly. I would be interested to read the story it came from.Agnes of God",2
"Jane Fonda, whom I respect highly as an actress, cannot save this dud. Neither the score nor the cinematography is memorable. Many scenes revolve around the fact that Dr. Livingstone is a smoker, which is a very flimsy hook upon which to hang a film. This film did not hold my interest--at several points I was consciously bored and had to exert will-power to finish watching it. Moreover, the views of psychiatric practice and hypnosis are wholly unrealistic. It seems this film could not decide what to be, and certainly lacked the courage to demythologize its subject.",2
"This is a year by year by year by year (!) review of Tar Heel basketball with Dean's life prior to Carolina thrown in for good measure.(He actually had one). It makes no effort to be balanced. You see, Dean never made a mistake, had a player who flunked out or got in trouble-ever! Down in Chapel Hill, life goes on and the Heels keep winning. Phooey! I'll take Bobby Knight throwing chairs and tantrums anyday. However, if you're from Carolina or a UNC alum, ignore this review and buy the book right away. You'll never notice the shortcomings. Now, how about a bio of Dean's predecessor and mentor, Frank McGuire.(He first hired Dean as an assistant). That would be a story.",2
"I read ""On Beauty"" based on its favorable reviews and my fondness for ""White Teeth."" However, I was disappointed to find ""On Beauty"" a shallow and immature book with underdeveloped characters. Equally bothering to me is the cultural context, which does not ring true. I have lived in the Boston area most of my life and am an academic. Smith's knowledge of Boston is slight and removed, while her perception of academia is that of a student. In addition, she has a weak grasp of American English. These problems combined to destroy this reader's ""willing suspension of disbelief.""",2
"I am tired of books about writers. I'm more tired of books about academics and universities. I give a free pass to Nabokov and that's it. This is purported to have such a great ear for language and move so seamlessly between these different races and classes and I didn't buy a bit of it. It lost me for good at the scene at the spoken word/poetry jam. Ultimately this could turn out to actually represent reality but I certainly hope I would never know about it. Goofy. The snarky Haitian guy, what? Maybe literature is becoming so narrowly focused that it's just writers writing for writers and reviewers (being writers) getting all fired up but it's getting lost on me.",2
"After reading White Teeth I was expecting this novel to be of the same calibre, sadly it is not. The plot is very jerky and the characters are under developed. The idea for the novel is good but it does not hang together well. White Teeth's weakness was it's ending and I think this novel has the same weakness or more so, a novel that seems to go nowhere, shame as it had so much potential.",2
"This is not a great book. Certainly don't rush to buy it on hard cover. The plot is somewhat disheveled, although some of the characters are well drawn. The most annoying thing about it is that Smith fails to understand and hence accurately render the African-American adolescents she depicts. Their language sounds constructed and forced. The prose also gets profuse at times. I don't recommend it. Buy Ishiguro's book, _Never Let Me Go_ instead.",2
"I rushed out to buy this book based upon the terrific reviews it received, especially from the New York Times (both Sunday and daily editions). And I loved White Teeth. But this book absolutely made me cringe. I must admit I was unable to get past the first 150 pages. To get that far required a major amount of willpower... I kept waiting for it to get better, which it didn't.The portraits are so self-conscious and false. Not a single character rang even halfway true to me. And the dialogue...so phony that the author's not especially skilled hand, was evident everywhere. If the author thinks she understands the United States, even New England...she is wrong. One year at the Radcliffe Institute does not, obviously, an expert make.An homage to Forster's Howard End...I think not.",2
I cannot believe this book was nominated for a prize. I had to leave this book after giving it a few chances - it was just babbling and pointless.,2
"Considering the awards it won, this should be a great book, but I found it very unengaging. The author sets up any number of interesting subplots (son of H is about to wed daughter of M, his arch enemy; K gets cheated out of inheriting a valuable painting by her deceased friend's family) but all these conflicts somehow just evaporate. Considering that the first 200 pages of the book are the setup, and the second 200 are one expectation after another thwarted on the part of the reader, this makes for very disappointing reading. Add to that that every character manages to lose our sympathy the second they gain it (K and C seem to become friends, even though every single recorded conversation contains snubs and misunderstandings) and I had the hardest figuring why I should care about any of them.",2
"From the accompanying reviews, I'm glad to see that I'm not the only person ""On Beauty"" left cold. The starred reviews! The alleged play on ""Howard's End""! What are these reviewers falling for? The book did not engage me and I couldn't be bothered to finish. If the novel had been set in England, Zadie Smith might have better understood the types she was writing about. As it is, little rings true in ""On Beauty"". Ignore the fuss and read something else.",2
"The story is weak and the characters meaningless. I never reached a point where I could relate to or sympathize with any of the characters. The story never really developed, it just seemed to wander without direction. Though Smith made a worthy effort to tie together multiple social issues, inter-racial relationships, contrasting classes and personal family/spousal conflict, she failed in the end. The book falls flat.",2
"Truly, I wanted to read this book. I tend toward more non-fiction and had asked my manager at work for a recommendation - she passed along this book. I found it difficult to get into - though I did like some of the characterizations (ie, fall leaving and slamming the door on the way out) - it just overall seemed like her writing wasn't very well integrated - in terms of the style(s) of writing in the book and the uneven development of characters.I found the way the characters spoke to be distractingly unnatural - and found found the oblique physical descriptions of people (explicit for some characters, almost soft porn - and very vague for others) difficult to hook into. The drama and the sub plots - just not all worked out very well and in the end - not that interesting. I forced myself to finish it in the hopes it would improve - not sure I would bother with another of her books.",2
"Zadie Smith has talent, but this book is lacking as a novel and would not have been published if the same work was delivered by an unknown author. The lack of a story is pathetic. The character development is rather good, but there's literally no story, beyond reading about a sad family going through a hard time. Do not waste your time.",2
"Why did Howard and Kiki ever get married? How did all of their children go such different ways? Why, after 443 pages, do I not know or care? Zadie Smith has written some beautiful passages, surrounded by flat characters. Phew, and not to mention the unending snippets of sociopolitical commentary she drags us through without ever getting to a point, or a compelling concept.",2
"I first spotted this book when it was released in hardcover and was excited about it. I LOVED her novel White Teeth and was impressed by the glowing reviews of On Beauty. Once it came out in paperback, I scooped it up. My first impression was not a good one. The dialouge in the beginning was flat, boring and often times confusing. But I trudged on, hoping that it would be another Zadie Smith gem. It never got any better. The characters were dull, annoying and stereotypical. The plotline was never interesting. All in all, i was very disapointed. Zadie Smith is usually a brilliant writer and that is the only reason I forced myself to make it through the book, months later. A good book usually takes me about 3 days. If you haven't read White Teeth, get that instead.White Teeth: A Novel",2
"Our book club read it with disbelief and puzzlement: why the universal critical acclaim? The writing is stilted, the story tedious and plot absurd: all in all I couldn't care too much about any of the characters. If anything, it is similar to her meandering horrible first book.",2
"After hearing several people suggest that this was indeed a good book, I made the purchase. This certainly wasn't one of the worst books I have ever read, but it is certainly very poorly written. As you read chapter after chapter, you are left wondering why exactly you are reading this book in the first place. I can't say I have ever read any other of Zadie Smith's works, but throughout the entire book, I couldn't help but feel like a 13-14 year old decided to write a book. You wanted to like the characters and find something interesting, but the book never delivers. I certainly regret making the purchase instead of borrowing the book from a friend or the library. If you are truly interested in reading this book, don't let me discourage you, but do not BUY the book.",2
"I was hugely disappointed with ""On Beauty"" after being blown away with Smith's debut ""White Teeth"". I was certain that she was the UK's new wunderkind.Many of the storylines lagged with soggy prose and inconsistent characterisation. Who are these people? We get to the end of this book not really knowing the essence of these characters. Too many of the characters are unlikeable. Not helpful for one who is desperately trying to like a book.I was also concerned with the amount of typos. I am a shameless stickler when it comes to this and was horrified to find so many mistakes. Where were the editors?It's not all bad, though. There are some beautifully written and hilarious moments throughout this book. The overall picture for me, however, was that of a boring effort and one which did not deserve to be shortlisted for the 2005 Man Booker Prize.",2
"Zadie Smith may have bitten off more than she can chew with ""On Beauty."" An examination of families, academia, race, class, infidelity, truth, and, ostensibly, beauty, the novel is wide ranging yet lacks a cohesive center. Smith relies heavily on dialogue that is unrealistic, clunky, and detracts from both the narrative threads and character development. Her grasps of American English is tenuous at best, especially her portrayal of ""street"" talk and even her use of academic language. Furthermore, her characters' voices lack consistency and constantly contradict themselves in tone and cadence. That said, the plot is fairly engaging, in particular the story line that follows Harold Belsey through a mid-life crisis. Perhaps in the future Smith should stick to a world that she knows and understands, as well as employ an adequate copy editor. For an intelligent and witty look at academic life and marital relationships, I heartily recommend Richard Russo's ""Straight Man.""",2
"If you'd like to read funny novels about academia, read David Lodge. As did many reviewers, I enjoyed White Teeth for the author's brash, audacious style (with certain reservations). This review should be rated in yawns not stars- she is an author with prodigiously interesting images but who really struggles when it comes to investing her own heart into characters and plotlines. Too clever for her own good and the reliance on Howard's End is a misstep. Clearly, Zadie Smith is the darling of critics but I trust Amazon reviewers on this one.",2
"This book, though good, wasn't great. I expect great from something receiving so much hype. I was interested in the story, but didn't much care about what happened for the characters. I wish I had spent my time somewhere else.",2
"White Teeth was dead boring but gave her the benefit of the doubt and perservered with Autograph Man, which again failed to capture my interest on any level. Have only read On Beauty as I always try and read the Booker shortlist and how this novel can be nominated,let alone shortlisted is beyond me. Again it just seems to be a raving mess. I really want to like this author - she interviews well, is very beautiful, I definately admire her, but if this wins over Arthur and George and Never let me Go there is something seriously wrong ( although last years winner was rubbish too!)",2
"As gifted a writer as Zadie Smith is, she disappoints in ""On Beauty"". Lifting a novel's entire structure from E.M Forster is not an ""homage"" - it is plagiarism. Translating another author's plot into present-day idiom is, at best, a sophomoric exercise. I expected better from this talented author.Do yourself a favor and ignore the hype that surrounds this book. Read the work in its original form, E.M. Forster's ""Howard End"". And pick up Zadie Smith's ""White Teeth"" to see what this author can do when she refrains from the derivative.",2
"I initially enjoyed this book and the characters but as I got further into the story, I started to feel like it wasn't going anywhere. The story seemed to run out of steam for me after Carlene discovered the truth about Howard's affair. I found myself wandering and losing interest after that point and then I finally gave up without finishing the book.",2
"So I read it -based upon the euphoric reviews. Excuse me - while there are two hilarious scenes regarding academia (Zora's blackmail of the dean to gain admission to a class and a university faculty meeting) and one truly sad scene when an older faculty member goes back to visit his working class dad, there is nothing else to recommend reading 400+ pages about basically uninteresting, sometimes nasty folks - no matter what their color. The book is disjointed in terms of narrative and uninteresting in terms of characters. If I met them at a gathering of any sort I would run for cover and I am so annoyed that I spent as much time with them as I did.",2
"After writing ""White Teeth,"" (which I highly recommend) Zadie Smith has not come close to a satisfying read.The plot of ""On Beauty"" is unoriginal -- how many times have we read about middle aged professors sleeping around, with the ""good"" wife and hip kids -- puhleese!The main charcters are uninteresting, and the writing is just OK.When the cover of a book has the author's name in type 5 times larger than the title, watch out!Waste of time.",2
"Hard to beleive a first time novelist would have gotten this published, let alone well reviewed. the characters don't speak anything like real people (an inner city rapper: ""I'm awfully glad you could come.""), the plot is barely in existence, the last third feel chopped together in a software program. Its childish. Prudish. Pompous. Read any two pages and you'll see.",2
"This is the only book by Zadie Smith that I have read and by the contents of this one I don't feel like reading any other. However, I guess I should not judge this ""it"" author by one lousy book. This book was so boring, it centered too much on academia and not on the people who had potential of being slightly riveting. There were too many stories at once, the connection between the characters was dubious, none of the chapters of the characters culminated in a satisfying ending. To conclude, Howard is such a bore, it was a mistake to center the book on this character.",2
"I cannot understand the praise this book has received. The subject matter was kind of boring, the characters completely unbelievable. It was an ok read and I laughed once or twice but it was really nothing special.",2
"""Recessional"" was alot like the salad bar served nightly at ""The Palms"" - lots of choices with very little quality. I got the distinct impression that the story line of this shallow novel was only a vehicle for Michener's pontifications on subjects as diverse as Aids, Race Relations and Aging. There was very little character development, so it was difficult to care about any one in particular. But the biggest problem I had was the inattention to detail; detail which has made earlier Michener novels so captivating and entertaining. There are few Michener books I haven't read, so it it hard for me to suggest, but perhaps it is time for Mr. Michener to pack up his typewriter and enjoy the company of his peers in a ""Palms""",2
"I have read and enjoyed nearly all James Michener's books so when I found ""Recesional"" at a flea market I thought I was in for yet another good read. I finished this book only because I felt compelled to say I read it through. The book is way below Michener's usual attention to detail, has a sappy storyline, several blatant inaccuracies and a reference to a ""retard"" I found disturbing for an author of this caliber. Definitely one for the recycle bin.",2
"The Kirkus review says it all. I wonder if Michener did more than preside over this book rather than write it himself. It seems driven by research his staff has unearthed about retirement homes, death and diseases. He then weaves a weak story, with corny dialogue around this information and calls it a novel. It would get little attention if his name wasn't on it.",2
"Having watched this movie four times and being TIG fan, I still feel that the movie was unconvincing, poorly written, very raw in too many episodes. However, if you like handsome men kicking butt- this film is for you. Thomas Ian Griffith is an attractive wild cop with moral standards. He plays the piano relatively well and is faithful to his girlfriend. What else would a girl want to see in a movie?",2
"Thomas Griffin acts as a kind of Van Damme in this film, it's like a low-budget version of Hard target except not nearly as good ( because no Van-Damme or John Woo ). I am a fan of martial arts pictures and like most american karate films this one is poorly choreographed. Ok Griffin has cool moves ... . The only reason that I wanted to watch this was of Lance Henrikson as he is such a great villian ( see Hard target ). Overall an average film with about 5 kickiboxing scenes along the way.",2
This basket it s hard to put up and it keeps on moving....I tried to use it for my little dog and it could not hold him. My dog is only 6 pounds.It's really made with cheap material.:(,2
"I would have given this just one star but I gave it two due to how easy it was to install. But, it got a low rating from me because of the quality of this particular basket. I bought it to replace my Wald Giant delivery basket which was to big for my needs, the quality of that basket was exceptional. This not so much, when i looked at it right out of the box it looked very flimsy especially the clips on the bottom of the basket. Its first test was a 100 mile 2 day trip where we were hit with rain for two days straight, any exposed unpainted metal rusted in a day and i live in the high desert not by the ocean. Then on the second day i put a small nalgene and my set of rain gear in and the clip that holds the support leg to the basket broke and I had to fix it with some bailing wire and tape. Overall im not happy with Wald and at this point I believe I wont be purchasing a basket of this style from them again.",2
Looks and feels inferior to my other Kipling products. The zipper is problematic in that it does not open and close with ease.,2
"The literature leads you to believe it works with the treo 755p. NOT UNLESS you use the bluetooth adapter. It seems to connect since both phone and the earphones indicate connected but it does not respond when music is played. To make it work you have to use the blue tooth adapter (which you shouldn't have to do since the phone is bluetooth). In addition, the stereo jack with the adapter does not fit in the small earplug jack outlet in the phone. You have to purchase a jack adapter also. Very disappointing.",2
"I own several Platronics Headsets (DSP400 / DSP500) to talk on Skype and I own a Macbook.I bough this headset to use with Skype, so I don't need to be wired to the computer while talking (since I talk a lot on Skype). I tried them with MacOSX 10.4.x (Tiger) and now with 10.5.x (Leopard) since I read the quality of bluetooth headsets would be better on Leopard.Since I own several plantronics headsets I was expecting a good quality. I have to confess that I hate the quality. The sound quality is bad and lagged. It drives me nuts to talk for a long time with them because of the lag and because I have to repeat myself several times (because the other person doesn't understand properly).",2
"GOOD:The unit produces good (maybe even above average) sound for most lay people. Pairing with the analog adapter was easy; and, pairing with laptop, desktop, and cell phone were very straightforward.BAD:The design of the headset unit is rather small. The (muted silvery) parts of the headset that connect the top part to the ear ""cups"" (speakers) are very cheap. The top (black) part is rather stiff.UGLY:If you have a wide or big head, you will need to spread the headset a lot everytime you put it on. When you do that, the muted silvery part will break sooner than later. It will break either around the area where it connects to the top (black) part or the other side where it connects to the ear ""cup"" units.BOTTOM LINE:If you have small head, this is most likely be a very good bluetooth stereo headsets for you. Otherwise, be very careful when putting them on your head and expect them to break.",2
"My initial impression was the sound quality was good but the workmanship was cheap. The cheapness was confirmed after about a month when the headphones stopped working and stopped taking a charge. Additionally, when speaking with Plantronics support I noticed a small crack on the union between the headband and the right earphone. Now, these headphones were never dropped and handled delicated since day one due to the noticably cheap quality.On the positive side Plantronics support seems first rate, the reason for the second star. Plantronics must be well aware of the problem because they went straight to processing a return. They are shipping me out a new unit in advance of me sending the old pair back. a much appreciated CS touch. hopfully the new batch has these issues fixed",2
As previously mentioned there is a lag of approx. .5 sec. I purchased these for use when practicing playing a guitar. Hitting a string and then hearing the sound .5 seconds later made my otherwise poor playing that much worse and made them unusable.I tried to test them as a headset with my HP bluetooth enabled notebook as well but was unable to get them to recognize each other and I finally gave up. I did not have this problem with another bluetooth headset I have.Tech. support at Plantronics was less than helpful. They insisted the lag was normal and typical of all wireless headphones.If all you need them for is to listen to music they may suffice. But consider the audio lag if you want them for any other purpose.,2
"Even if you only read the cover, the author still deceived you. The Magyars conquered Hungary about 800 AD and the venus goes back a few thousand years.I also noted every one of Hamilton's Hungarians was either shady, greedy, or both. Worst of all, her plot was filled with unlikely coincidences.I grew up in a Hungarian family and so I regret the author didn't take advantage of Hungarian culture. For example, Hungarian is the world's most pretty language but the author hardly mentioned it. The author also could have written more about Hungarian cuisine.Hungarian cold cuts and sausage have a very unusual flavor that is unlike anything else in the world. Outside Hungary very few people know the taste sensation of a good Hurka.",2
"Here's another Italian cannibal movie and I continue to find there isn't much exciting about this genre. Again, we have mostly controversy over killing animals which I really don't find either disturbing or entertaining at all.I am also a little bored at seeing Kerman in another movie.There really was one scene where they could have taken the movie 'too far' but they held back.I was hoping they would take things too far.",2
"This movie gets 2 stars only for it';s gore content. if you are a completest who needs to see every cannibal gore movie, then by all means check this out... just don't expect much. This movies tries to mix a Jim Jones type cult w/ cannibals. The gore is poorly done. The movie is hard to watch. Not the best of it's genre.",2
"I've not seen Jean-Luc Godard's original but it has to be better than this overripe film. I'd call it a case of style over substance but there's no discernible style here. Richard Gere's preening narcissistic punk is downright grating. You wonder what Valerie Kaprisky's architecture student sees in this jerk. But, then, Kaprisky's only real talent on display here is shedding her clothes. Which leads to the film's mandatory love scenes. Boring! There's no compelling reason to see this mediocrity.",2

My husband and I were a week away from getting married and still could not agree on our wedding band set. We came across these and instantly fell in love with them.. I ordered them right away and got them 2 days later. The color on the bands were perfect and the outside of the ring was smooth and beautiful.. It was exactly what we wanted.. We haev been married for 3 weeks today and we are so unhappy with the quality of these rings. The color is coming off of mine and is almost completely off my husbands and they are scratched..

There are a few bright and charming moments, but those are heavily outweighed by uninspired numbers like ""For You Blue"" and production massacres of ""The Long and Winding Road"" and ""Across the Universe.""

"I don't know which movie you people saw, but in my opinion, this movie was terrible. The only good thing about it is it's comedic value. That, and I watched it with a total hottie.",2
"DREAMCATCHER, as a title, suggests there may be story reasons for spending time watching this movie. Stephen King does know how to spin a tale (as we are reminded in seeing at least one of his books make it to the screen every year). The problem is there just is no story here. A scary movie? No, a very funny spoof of the alien genre duds perhaps. BUT, there are four really good reasons to sit through this otherwise forgetable bit of indigestion: Damien Lewis, Thomas Jane, Jason Lee, and Timothy Olyphant. They make the best of a scrawny script and play off each other very well. As for Donnie Wahlberg, Morgan Freeman and Tom Sizemore - well, maybe it was easy money. A movie to see only if the desperation level is higher than the judicious taste level.",2
"This was a sadly typical horror flick; in all fairness I don't like horror flicks and at first didn't realize this was one of them. It didn't take long for the movie to clearly identify itself as a movie devoted to blood and gore.If you're really into horror movies you may enjoy this one; for those of us who don't, this is a great one to skip!",2
"Starts good, but fall on it's face past half of the movie. Definitely another Stephen King film. Never again.",2
"First of all I am not even sure if this movie had a plot at all. I fell asleep through most of this movie. The character development was horrible. Whenever I decide to watch a King movie I set my expectations low, because lets face it most of them aren't very good. I set my expectations very low and I still was disappointed. I recommmend tht you read the book. I can't even really recommend this movie to King fans because I am afraid it will disappoint fans and non-fans alike.",2
"Dream Catcher (Widescreen Edition) (2003) could have been a good sci-fi experience for me but our first glimpse behind the bathroom door was just too unsightly, even for a die hard Steven King fan like me. As such, I can not rate this film at higher than 2 stars. If this visually explicit scene could have been eliminated I am sure I would have liked this film and rated it at least 3 to 4 stars.It was enough to demonstrate that the creature gestated in the digestive tract of its host by the difficulty the victim had with eating and the resulting rude noises. The audience didn't need the very explicit lesson in Digestive Diseases. That scene aside, there was much I liked about the remainder of this movie. Pardon me for my sensibilities. I am still a Steven King fan but feel he should have stopped short at the Bathroom door since crossing that ugly threshold added nothing essential to the film.",2
"Many things in the movie do not connect. A lot of things in the beginning have absolutely nothing to do with the outcome at the end. If you're going to place events in a movie, then place them there for a reason!The story is done in a way that tries to make the movie special, but it turns out to be just another ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" type of movie. This is good to watch one time, but after that you won't want to watch it over and over again. Spend your money on something else.",2
"This movie could have been so much better. It started out fairly well but just didn't hold together after the initial introduction. The movie lost me completely in the bathroom scene. You've got a monster trapped in the toilet, but that toothpick on the floor is out of your reach, and you need it so badly that you let the monster out to get it? You have to ask yourself, ""What's WRONG with this person?""Morgan Freeman's performance in this movie was also a big disappointment. He's such a talented actor, but here he seems to be just going through the motions. His character just falls flat. And as noted in an earlier review, the hair and eyebrows make him look silly and cartoonish.No big surprises in the final battle sequence. You pretty much know by this point who the two sides are going to be. But that last little bit after the fight - whose idea was that? I just wanted to shout at the television, ""What? NO! That CAN'T be the end!"" What a let-down.",2
"I didn't really care for this movie but it's not the worst I have seen. If you liked the book, then you will probably feel the same as I do.The movie just misses way too much of the story and the ending is completely horrible. I watched this because I really liked the book and was hoping that this would be somewhat worthy but it is not. Why are so many movies that are made from Stephen King stories so off? His books are incredible (one of my favorite authors) but the movies are mostly flat. I think they miss out on the feelings that King displays so well in his characters.I'd recommend reading the book and skipping this movie all together.",2
"This movie reminds me of almost all movies Stephen Kings been associated with--it starts great and is really interesting for the first third--barely holds your interest for the second third-and falls apart by the final third. As he too frequently does-there's a gifted ""special"" person who plays a significant role in the movies outcome. That doesn't ruin the movie--but the covert military operation which is headed by Morgan Freeman is a total waste and takes what little suspense is left in the movie and thows it out for good.The concept was good--some friends are isolated, and encounter a stranger who has a mysterious ailment--and that part of the story is quite entertaiining, but the ending is lame and ruins the initial story line. Suspense and horror are replaced by mayhem and firepower. Is it worth watching--sort of--but is it worth owning--no way!",2
Dreamcatcher wasn't a horrible movie but maybe if I had read the book I would have gotten a better feel for the film. The film is long and drawn out and never really expalins what's going on. Jason Lee's performance is what saved the film for me. Kudos also go to Thomas Jane who just appeared in the vastly superior The Mist. I guess I will read the book and then view the film again. I would say the film is for die hard King fans only.,2
"I love horror films and tend to be extremely forgiving of even the worst schlock, but Dreamcatcher is truly a disappointment. Upon first viewing there were aspects of this film that I enjoyed, but the more I thought about it... the less any of it made sense. The plot is convoluted, the characters are wasted, and the alien fungus-monsters seem to have the psychic ability to create massive plot holes wherever they roam.Stephen King cannabalized half a dozen of his previous works to produce this self-plagiarism, and the movie adaptation is even worse. I have seen (and own) some of the worst movies ever made, and I enjoy them greatly -- but Dreamcatcher does not merit a second viewing... or a first, for that matter.",2
How disappointing. Its extremely rare when you see a film that is faithful to the novel. Apparently they didn't want to remain faithful to story. Can someone please make a good adaptation of a stephen king novel? Does any studio exist that will take the time to do this? Please lord. Good to see more upcoming actors like Jason Lee and Timothy Olyphant get more screen time although the film doesn't do them much justice. Watch this one with no expectations and you may like it. That and I hope you didn't read the novel first.,2
"OK... so every now and then there is a movie that comes out that may be okay in it's own right, but has next to no similarities to the story on which it was based. I have been a Stephen King fan for years and have always made a point of reading his books before seeing any of the movies. I enjoyed the book, the story was great... I'm not sure what they screenplay writers read, but it was NOT the book. They got some of the basic plotline and such, but there was almost no character development (and where there was, it was wrong... totally different from the actual chracters in the book) and they must have been bored with their own work by the end, because what they put in for an ending was very simply made up. They missed the entire point of the book and went WAY off track. So if you like Stephen King, don't bother. If you like campy ""B"" movies and have never read a Stephen King book in your life... you may just like it.",2
"Stephen King should pass up the money and not let his novels be made into movies. It never works out right. The one decent movie made from one of his books ( The Shining ), he hates.This movie is great for the brief period of time that it follows the novel. The first act where you are introduced to the characters could not have been done better. The casting is great as well as the initial build up of suspense. The problem is that when the aliens are finally introduced, the movie tries to go over the top with cliched military conspiraccies and surprise twists when a subtle hand is what is needed. The ending is the most rediculous thing I have ever seen.Don't waste your time or money on this. Check out the book from the library and leave it at that.",2
"I'm a huge fan of anything Stephan King, that being said I'm embarassed for him for having put his name on this movie. I've read the book and this movie is a huge disappointment. This movie has none of the depth or character developement of the book. You don't get a sense of the friendships, why they work, how or why they've lasted this long. The intorduction of the binding facgor of these friendships (the man child they saved a pre-teens)was sloppy at best, and pretentious at worst.If you haven't read the book then you might fine this movie (and I use the term losely) entertaining.

"This movie really isn't sure what it wants to be. Part Independence Day, part X-Men, and part Alien, it even makes references in passing to another Stephen King story, Stand By Me.Essentially the film can be divided into two halves -- the enigmatic first half where four thirtysomethings make moderate use of their ESP capabilities on their way through their professional lives, one flashback to 20-years-ago, towards a mid-winter cabin destination. In the second half, we get the ridiculous Alien/Independence Day sub-plot, with Morgan Freeman being forced to swear (frequently) in order to convince us that he's not the same endearing character from Se7en and the Shawshank Redemption.In the end, the Earth is saved -- my apologies if that ruins it for anyone -- but this dog's dinner should retain your attention for about an hour. Once the aliens turn up and start visiting people's bottoms, don't feel embarrassed about reaching for the fast-forward button.",2

"I've had it for years ($138 CAD in January 2004) and have been using it far more often than my kitchenaid heavy duty mixer and my other Braun combimax 650 food processor. I've had to replace the motor part and enjoy using all the attachments, except for the whisk, simply because it's not really dishwasher friendly as advertised - while clean and dry, it will leak when mixing the food, a dark brown liquid - could be rust or oil. I dunno if this is a design flaw that is fixed with current models or I simply need to send it for repair - but why did it start leaking in the first place? Is it really dishwasher safe? I just know it's not pleasant to have suspicious brown liquid drip into your fluffy white whipped cream! Ugh!",3
His tone is so dark is hard to follow. Interesting but somehow i always end up listeniing and paying more attention to what Swallow and Favre are doing than what O'leary is. Not really my cup of tea....you really have to dig his rythm and tone to get into his vibe. Compositions did not stand out as much either. Nice but was expecting more specialy when in the company of such heavy weights.,3
"A very typical Bolly wood drama of the eighties. A loyal union leader is murdered and made it to look like an accident. His son grows up and takes revenge. This was Sanjay Dutts first movie and it shows... childish acting and dancing. However if does give the film a fresh feel. Its got all you can expect from a Hindi movie, songs dance, action, tragedy and of course a happy ending. Music is particularly melodious and RD Burman has done a great job at that. Amjad Khan does a positive role here. A must see for Sanjay Dutt fans and also for those who enjoy eighties Hindi cinema. Its fun to see Shakti Kapoor and Sanjay Dutt disco dancing.",3
I enjoyed this book and found it informative but if you are looking for more depth and a search for spiritual guidence then it lacks a little in this respect. Overall a informative journey.,3
"I just read this book, a little late I guess. Hersh should have waited a year or two to write this then he could have added a couple more chapters, in light of the many disclosures that have come out since then. I was always a strong Kennedy fan, but now I find that I am a disappointed Kennedy fan. In spite of the Cuban Crises I think JFK was probably an average President, not great, but also not poor. Hersh covers a lot of ground but seems to have completely missed the Mary Pinchot Meyer affair. Perhaps this was intentional for some reason, but he certainly failed to mention it while discussing all the other JFK women. (I guess Pinchott was of a higher class paramour than the others). Since Hersh wrote this book it seems the entire Kennedy clan has taken somewhat of a dive, but I guess that under today's ethics standards that's to be expected. We wouldn't expect books written by Salinger, O'Donnell, Fay, and in particular Schlesinger to be objective.",3
"An important corrective to brainless Kennedy worship but not in retrospect, worthy of its length. I mean so JFK banged alot of girls who had not said ""I do"" to him. But fun in a gossipy way. Plus of course the Kennedys were all crooks. According to this book!",3
"Mr. Hersh paints a convincing picture of JFK as an extremely hard working, ambitious man who was party to a myriad of addictions including painkillers and sex. I actually found the early sections of the book which deal primarily with his father Joe Kennedy to be insightful into the kind of environment he grew up in and undoubtably led to his immoral nature. Where Hersh is on weaker ground is when he tries to psychoanalyze JFK. He attempts to connect all of Kennedy's personal issues to decisions made about international politics, a hazardous course. I think Hersh was too close to Kennedy and his sense of profound disappointment as well as his breathy, rumormonger style of writing sometimes hurts his credibility which is unforunate because I think the author wrote a thought provoking, intelligent book",3
"Interesting book, Seymour. Quick get onto the British royal family, they would love you to write '' The Dark Side of a Wayward Princess'' If you got the girls slavering over the Kennedys exploits , just imagine how the boys would love..... the dark side of Lady Di, go get 'em Seymour!!!.All in all an interesting book , but like an early reviewer I could not get Kitty Keller out of my mind. Still we have to keep an open mind about all politicians.",3
"I actually didn't read the book but skimmed it at Borders because they have the most comfortable chairs to crash in. Haven't we heard enough about this guy. Geez. And brook@sofcom.net, whoever you are, get a grip. You're supposed to review the book not offer up another lame conspiracy theory. Go take your neglected wife to dinner and turn off the computer already.",3
"Book seems very well researched, but can be a bit of a slog in places. Should have had a chapter on the martyr/myth process that evolved after Kennedy's assassination. What a mess.",3
"I found this book to be quite interesting regarding the facts of JFK's presidency...and his constant conspiring with RFK to get their way. I was quite familiar with most of what I read. I had heard about lots of this information on TV documentaries and other books about JFK. So, most of it didn't come as a surprise. It didn't come across to me as filth, but facts. And I'm quite sure most or all of it is true. Hersh was quite free in naming his sources. Worth a read and adding to your library if you are unfamiliar with the dark side of JFK. If you think JFK walks on water, don't read it. It will shatter your beliefs. I gave it three stars because of the familiarity of the material.",3
"This book is basically a repeat and repeat and repeat of what we already know about John Kennedy. In every chapter are claims of President Kennedy's indiscretions, well we know that, did you just have to fill the pages, I was expecting some good journalism, not repeats.And what is with all those footnotes. Way too many.",3
"As if the first conspiracy were not enough more mediocre trash about JFK. So what's the point?Could it be people are finally finding out who really wanted JFK dead and why??? Kennedy not Johnson declared the WAR on poverty. Before he died he printed 5.5 BILLION in United States Notes to finance that WAR, not Vietnam mind you, but the War on poverty. United States Notes (Legal tender for all debts public and private) We are talking 5.5 Billion dollars in money without a Federal reserve stamp. 5.5 Billion dollars that every Bank in the Country was going to have to make change for and deal with day in and day out and not be able to charge a dimes worth of interest on because it was not FEDERAL RESEVRE MONEY!!! ??? What could be worse??? The guy couldn't keep his U NO WHAT in his pants. But he never did near the damage that the fascist's that murdered him have>",3
"This is our second such device; the first one served us well for more than ten years. This replacement has a stiffer, less pliant hose. The motor seems to be stronger, pushing out a more vibrant and thinner stream of water, which, when inadvertently aimed at soft skin tissue, under the tongue for example, causes a degree of pain. The nozzle is located under the blue plastic container of water and we find it awkward to remove. The water tank is easy to use; we normally put in two small glasses of water and when we are done, we let the hose drop into the sink and the water left in the container drains out into the sink. We find that we are making less use of this model than we did of the previous one.",3
"I'm happy with this purchase, but would like a *much* longer & more flexible tube from the base unit to the part that you hold, even if I had to purchase it separately. Also I would prefer the jet to be a bit more powerful.",3
"This product replaced my WaterPik personal unit which lasted barely 3 years. The problem I had with thatunit is similar to this...the pumping of the water from the holding container to the jet isn't reliable...This unit too, works erratically, and I have to constantly reposition and reset the container filled with water on the base. Sometimes no water comes out and I realize the contact might be off...When I say ""contact', I'mtalking about the small rubber ring on the bottom of the water container having to meet the rubber ringthat sits on top of the motorized base. If it's slightly off, no water comes out of the jet...Half the time I thinkit's perfect and it's not. So, something about the design of this unit isn't right..I gave it 3 stars because whenit works, it works fine...I spend a lot of time trying to figure out what a perfect contact IS..and most of thetime, there's nothing obvious to notice.",3
"There is not much to say about a waterpik. This one arrived promptly, was well packed and worked.The disadvantage of this one is that the top does not fit when you are through. The actual pik is in the way.I shopped around however and for me this is the best model. May be it is time to design a more practical one.The cord is long enough to reach anywhere on your bathroom counter.I had the identical model before and it worked for years, until mysteriously the water stopped flowing throuhg the handle.",3
"Cleans debris between teeth very effectively, but the unit is very, very noisy. Also, difficult keeping connection clean.",3
Works OK but has sloppy design and/or manufacturing. Two examples: very hard to insert or remove pick from handle; jet force control knob in handle is loose and slides back and forth when using the WaterPik.,3
"I have had many waterpiks over the years. This one looks good, but it's operation is erratic, someimes feels like it's about to conk out, but it hasn't, so far so good, but not the best I've had.",3
It was OK but not the best book ever since I have long time I read it and it was OK like I said,3
"My son loves this series. The story, of course, is wonderful, but B.D. Wong's narration is grating. The characters voices are all some version of whiny. Not even close to how I imagine these characters sounding. If you don't find that annoying, you'll be well pleased with your purchase. I wish there were another version with a different narrator. I would buy the whole set.",3
This book is an OK book. I just did not find this book entertaining enough to keep my attention.,3

"This is a pleasant light comedy from the 70's.Sidney Poitier as a milkman-hypnotist plays a relaxed straight role, with his sidekick, the refreshing Bill Cosby...they make a good team, and complement each other's characters perfectly.Jimmie Walker as the gormless ""Bootney Farnsworth"" provides a reasonable number of laughs.This is not a laugh-out-loud comedy, but a gentler, happier format...mild pleasant humour, of a feel-good escapist variety.A good buy for fans of the irrepressible Bill Cosby.",3
"Clyde Williams and Billy Foster are a couple of blue-collar workers in Atlanta who have promised to raise funds for their fraternal order,the Brothers and Sisters of Shaka. However, their method for raising the money involves travelling to New Orleans and rigging a boxing match. Using hypnotism, they turn the scrawny underdog into a super-confident fighting machine. They bet heavily on him, he wins easily, and they return to Atlanta with their money. All is fine until the gangsters conned by these two figure out what happened show up in Atlanta with a grudge. Now Williams and Foster have to rig the fight again so the gangsters can get their money back or they'll be killed. Can they do it again...? The execution of the score sucks, but it's still a good movie. Thank you for reading my review. -Bootney Farnsworth, the champ!",3
I ordered it as a replacement for one like it that is not pumping properly. The one I received is way smaller in capacity that the present one. It is too much of a hastle to send it back.,3
"I got this to replace my leaky Grohe dispenser. The Grohe design has the plunger part larger than the base and fits over the base. So,, when it leaks a little it runs down the base and I always had a soap mess around the base. This Kohler design has the plunger being smaller than the base and fits inside it. So,, if it should ever leak or weep it will simply run down back into the bottle. Nice design on that part. The bottle on the other hand is a dinky little 8oz. Maybe just me but I find it annoying having to fill these things so often. And good luck trying to find a larger bottle with the same threads on it. I actually modified this and fashioned a new bottle out of pvc pipe and tripled the capacity. Works like a champ now. I'm working on an even bigger bottle so when I need to fill it I can simply dump a whole large bottle soap in there and toss the empty. (my girlfriend just shakes her head) Kohler should at least offer a larger bottle as and accessory.",3
"This unit works exactly as advertised and the product was simple. My only beef is the significant delay between pushing a button on the remote, and the IR signal begin send. I suppose this might be inevitable, but I also use an IR range extender and that unit doesn't introduce any delay at all that I can detect. The delay isn't problematic except when you want to flip through menus, etc. Then it's almost unbearable. I decided the RF feature wasn't worth it because of that and returned mine.",3
"Pros:1. All controls are in one place and the screens are relative easy to navigate.2. Help system (Remote Assistant) is extremely... helpful.3. Fairly easy to set up and program, particularly if your device is in Logitech's device database.4. Looks and feels sexy.Cons:1. Touchscreen buttons take some getting used to as does the delay when sending an RF signal.2. Your computer and internet connection must be within reach to program and troubleshoot devices. My computer is on the second floor of my house, so I get a lot of cardio everytime I change the setting or add a new device.3. Coming to the realization that you've just spent $500 on a remote control.",3
"The unit functions satisfactorily. However, the speed of the signal transmitted to the remote units is very very slow...on the order of 1 character per second. Agonizing slow when you are trying to update over several fields.",3
"I think my expectations were a little to high, the extender does the job but does not have a strong signal and seems a little slower.",3
"Works well with both the Harmony 890 and 1000. Fairly easy to set up, though there are two HUGE drawbacks which Logitech should fix.1. They have hard-wired the cable to the Extender so that you have to unplug the unit whenever you want to upgrade the settings - a royal pain when it's plugged in behind your components.2. Even if you want to make a tiny change to the Harmony settings (e.g. changing a couple of icons) you have to update BOTH the Harmony and the Extender. This takes much longer and, because it's hard-wired, is very annoying.",3
"The devices works great. I sync'd the extender and the Harmony 1000 and had everything working quite nicely. But, I am very unhappy with the IR wires. The adhesive on the emitters is very poor. Three of the five attached emitters fell off within the first 3 weeks.",3

"Having never before read a Star Trek novel, I was a bit reluctant to buy ""A Hard Rain"". However, I like Dr. Crusher, and I like Picard, and I love seeing them play characters on the Holodeck, so I went through with the purchase. I wasn't expecting Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, but I wasn't exactly prepared for a writing style seemingly aimed at preteen adolescents. Perhaps the most annoying aspect of the book was the author's overuse of similes. I just wanted to get through one page without something being ""like a..."". Additionally, the relationship between Crusher and Picard was never clearly defined. It appeared that the author wanted to convey a sense of romantic feelings between the two, but he just could not bring himself to do so. I wouldn't call the book a waste of time, but I wouldn't recommend it either.",3
"I collect atlases in a modest way and this is the most disappointing one I have ever purchased. The satellite pictures were a novelty on publication (although not now) and the context outline at the top right of each righthand page is an idea worth copying, but the style of cartography only works for large areas of vacant land. The maps of Western Europe in particular are incomprehensible even with a magnifying glass. In one map for example the name LONDON is printed on an opaque yellow background that entirely eliminates an area of land some sixty miles by fifteen - none of which is actually in London itself. It is in parts more of a low-resolution road atlas than a genuine geographical work.",3
"Ice Cube - The Predator (Priority, 1992)After AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted, Kill At Will EP, and Death Certificate, all classics, this album was a step down. Cube didn't really bring it like he did in the past. Ironically, this is the one of his most successful albums due to his singles ""Wicked"" and the the smash ""It Was a Good Day"". There are other good songs on here such as ""Now I Gotta Wet'cha"" and ""Check Yo' Self"" (the original, which is better than the more popular remix). Whatever fans Cube lost with this album, he sure gained a lot more. -EJR",3
"Ice Cube is a great artist and performer. Really did'nt notice when I purchased the CD, that it was not clean.That is the reason I gave it three stars, plus there are not many tracks on it that I like.",3
"Ice Cub changed his rap style on this album when his old one was just fine. The tracks on this one were mediocre. I recommend Ice Cube's earlier albums, ""Death Certificate"" and ""Amerikkka's Most Wanted"", which are hip hop classics.",3
"This isn't exactly what I expected, however, Cube put a few really dope songs on this joint. 'The Predator,' 'We Had to Tear This MotherF-cker Up,' and Cube's best track ever, 'It Was a Good Day,' are all on this album. Since 'The Predator' and ' We had to Tear...' never appeared on rap compilations you should get this album just for those tracks. If you only like 'It was a good day,' I'm sure you could find it on a various artists CD. In conclusion, this is a pretty good rap CD, but if you love Cube, get Death certificate.",3
"Ice Cube's first two solo-albums are classics, but his third, The Predator, is not. Don't get me wrong, it's still alright. On-point production and tight rhymes. Cube has changed his style a bit on his album, and tried some new formulas. He has replaced the West Coast funk-beats with hard underground beats. His lyrics hit hard, and you can still feel his anger on most songs on this album (not as much as on AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted or Death Certificate though).Still, this is good a hip-hop album and worth checking out. If you haven't got his first two albums, then buy them before you buy this, because they're much better.",3
"Ice Cube came out with the single wicked which was a different style than ""Classic Cube"". Note: Anytime a rapper changes his flow or style can be dangerous. Any rapper changing it to a tongue twisting style is just a recipe for disaster. Should have stayed the same but polished his flow. We'll always have death certificate.",3
let it go in two ears and stay in the brain. cube is in his prime here. i listened to this one on my bike and i never lost speed once!,3
I would not encourage someone to buy this CD. But I would encourage them to buy his newest CD.,3
"This album lacked some of the elements of intensity, and realismfrom the previous two albums. However Ice Cube has some good traks like ""It was a Good Day"", ""Wicked"", ""Who got the Camera"" and ""Check Yo Self"". Honesty you should pick this up this album- but only if you a dedicated Ice Cube fan.",3
"I was quite disappointed with this CD and Ben E King's "" The BestOf"" because both are mono records. Except when I heard the songsback then on the radio, on most LP's- released in the 60's-all of their recordings were in full stereo. The songs aregreat, no doubt, but should I have known this before I wouldhave chosen other ""greatest hits"" compilations in stereo.",3
I saw this movie as a very young girl and have waited for it to come on on DVD.We must never forget those people that were so brave in times that were so evil.,3
"While I enjoyed the playing on this CD, I was a bit disappointed. I think that he maybe went for too much. The sound quality is great. And obviously with someone like Greg the musicality is great as well, but the songs are unfocused. And by that I DO NOT mean that that the songs don't sound enough alike. The drum sounds and instrumentation sound different from track to track. I know that this is picky but there you go. If you like this CD however you would probably love Vinnie Coliautas'a CD.",3
I would classify this as a lower end toner. It has a very strong scent and if you get some on your lips it has quite an after-taste. So roll your lips inward as you spray. The spray bottle sends out fairly large droplets. I am just about finished with this bottle and am not planning to re-order. Should have stayed with Yonka.,3
"I have had great pictures with the RCA cds4100 digital camera.The pictures are clear and you can opt for a preflash or not,I chose not to.

"I think that this is an OK Hendrix album but there is one mistake, IT IS WAY TO SHORT!!!!!!!!! If you want to get a really good Hendrix Album than just get ""Experience Hendrix: The Best of Jimi Hendrix"" not this, don't get me wrong, I love Hendrix's music just not this album.",3
"I can never slam ANYTHING that Hendrix has ever done,but the only purpose that 'Smash Hits' is likely to serve for anyone is to introduce a new(is there anyone on the planet that hasn't heard Hendrix's music by now?)fan.Okay,MAYBE a young teen that wishes to enjoy some of his parent's(or even grandparent's)music of days long gone.The cuts here have apparently been remastered.Tunes that I could never grow too tired of are ""The Wind Cries Mary"",""Fire""(one of my all-time Hendrix favorites),Dylan's ""All Along The Watchtower"",""Crosstown Traffic"" and ""Manic Depression"".For die-hards OR new fans.",3
"I have said that any Hendrix disc with Purple Haze and Watchtower gets at least three stars. And I stand by that claim. Sadly, the rest of the collection is in sorry shape. For one, NOTHING is contained from Axis: Bold As Love, too bad because If 6 Was 9 and Castles Made of Sand are two fine cuts. For another, Voodoo Child (Slight Return) was skipped. Why? I'm sorry, but that's inexcusable. And why are Can You See Me and Remember, average Hendrix cuts in my mind, included when you can do so much better with Jimi? Smash Hits simply doesn't make the cut.",3
better than the mini-series. I do like the casting of Kim Delaney as Lucky instead of Nicolette Sheridan. The role just suits Kim better. The mini-series is is entertaining but in my opinion not worth purchasing. Get the book or wait till it comes on cable again!,3
"Not to be confused with Slammin' Watusis or Smashed Gladys, Slammin' Gladys released their self-titled debut in 1992, right at the tail end of America's love affair with hair metal. Slammin' Gladys wasn't as slick and polished as say Firehouse or Slaughter, instead opting for a bluesier, funk-infused sound. The band benefited from the patronage of Warrant vocalist Jani Lane, who executive produced the album.The album is a perfectly decent serving of funk rock, but it's really nothing you haven't heard before. Bands like Electric Boys, D-A-D, and Bang Tango were also bringing this kind of noise, and did a more memorable job of it. Still, this is a fun album that will definitely get you movin' if you're into this kind of music. Standout tracks include Love is My Drug and the band's version of the Janis Joplin staple Piece of My Heart.",3

"Pros: Fast paced racing game; futuristic cars and nice graphics; drifting is funCons: Sound and music make your ears bleed; physics engine resembles the '90's; winning races is almost impossibleOverall this is a good buy for someone who likes to see how much the PS3 can do but the game experience is a bid letdown when you have titles like ProStreet, Dirt or even Carbon.",3
"I'm not a pro gamer but have played this game enough to realize both advantages and limitations:pros:good scenery and car graphic detailnice music even at beginning levelsinnovative routes and drifting adds a nice touchcons:lacks realism, it feels the car is in autopilot at timesif you memorize the corners better than rivals you'll end up placing well no matter how skilled you arecars look much better in preview then when the game is played(disappointing)",3

"A 2-CD set, this is vol. X in the laudable Stravinsky the Composer series cond. by Stravinsky's long-time collaborator R. Craft. CD 1 pairs Stravinsky's 1947 revision of his 1911 burlesque ballet Petroushka (the complete 4-part ballet, not the suite drawn from it) with the 1914 version of The Nightingale, his opera (in Russian, based on a tale by Hans C. Andersen) begun 1908, set aside 1909, finished 1913-14, rev. 1962. In 1917, Stravinsky wrote The Song of the Nightingale, a tone poem based on and much better known than the opera. This CD contains the complete opera (NOT the tone poem); the booklet has the libretto in Russian and English only. CD 2 is a bonus CD of excerpts from other CD's in the series. The works on CD 2 are nowhere listed with the CD itself: see above for Amazon.com's listing of these works.",3
"A little harder thank it looks. There are a couple of tiny ocean parts that will be easily lost, not sure why there were not just cut bigger. If the capitols were listed on the puzzle pieces I think the kids would be more inclined to learn them, but being on the inside they don't pay any attention to them. But my kids love map puzzles so they don't mind much. It is a good sturdy cardboard puzzle.",3
"Let me tell you at first I was quite hesitant about buying this album after ""Demonic"", because I hated Chuck BIlly's new ""Death Metal"" vocals. But I was pleased to see that he went more back to his old syle. This isn't as good as older ('87-90)Testament, but for '99 it's pretty damn hard. Great to see Dave Lombardo in there now. 1986 to 1990 were the best speed/thrash metal years, and that can be put in stone.",3
"This is a pretty ok album. The only really fast song is DNR but if you like 80s style speed metal you should get this, but if your a fan of 90s hardcore metal like SOAD or SEPULTURA or something like that this might leave you dissapointed.+ the guitars on this cd arent very heavy",3
"Well, what can I say that has not been said. I rate this album a 3 because...it is just ok. Production is muddy, can't hear each individual instrument, guitar solos are nonexistant(were is James Murphy), bass is buried in the mix and drumming rhythms are sooooooo repetitive. Don't get me wrong this album rocks but there are many much better rescent releases out there. My big disappointment is the fact that this album has a killer line up but the song writing is average. Save your money and buy the new Control Denied!",3
"The group of musicians on this cd is good, but one should expect better. I haven't listened to all of Testament's albums yet, but i would have to say this is the worst i've heard. But then again, being able to top their albums The New Order and Practice what you Preach wouldn't be an easy task. So don't expect wicked solo's on every track. Only 3 or four have solos (if i remember correctly). So don't buy this if you are just starting your Testament collection.",3
"In this book, Terry Bradshaw recyles some of his stories from his book/audio ""It's only a Game."" The book is simple and repetitive but still contains some of the Bradshaw humor. It incorporates what he says when giving his motivational speeches at business functions. I enjoyed it for light recreational reading, but probably would not have purchased it if it hadn't been discounted.",3

"If you have followed the case, you need to read ""Presumed Guilty."" I don't believe Scott is innocent, but I feel this book exposes areas where known facts were suppressed. I also question Geragos's reasons for trying to stop this book from being released since it helps his client. Now I wonder if Geragos did all he could.",3
"The book is well written and obviously well researched. But it is almost exclusively a book that concentrates on the 'popular' British reaction to the American Civil War. Those looking for more detailed information about government actions and decisions regarding the Union Blockade, The Trent Affair and any other official reactions would do better to find something else.The book does, though, bring to light the less well known reactions of people in Britain who were affected by the Civil War economically.",3
"Like the title implies, this isn't no knife's best work to date. Gone is the production of Mark Trombino (Blink 182, Jimmy Eat World, Christie Front Drive) and here is the production of Greg Wales. For the most part, 'Riot for Romance!' simply rolls and doesn't rock. The title track and 'Permanent for now' are great tunes, very remeniscent of the tracks on 'Hit Man Dreams' -- angular guitar lines, unconventional timing, basically everything one would expect from No Knife. But after the first two tracks, everything goes downhill from there. The album becomes rather boring and tedious, save the lovely instrumental 'May I call you doll?'. Gone is the inventive guitar work, replaced by standard and rather ""ho-hum"" melodies.This is by no means a bad record, but if you're interested in No Knife, go pick up the aforementioned 'Hit Man Dreams' or 'Fire in the city of Automatons'.No Knife would be well served to bring back Trombino for future endeavors.",3

"Guess this is the follow-up to the self-titled Quatermass album that emerged in 1970.Heard that lp went about as quick as it came.'Long Road' is an apparent reunion of the band,with just one original member,drummer Mick Underwood.Joining up with Underwood is bassist Nick Simper(Deep Purple's original bassist)and two top session players Gary Davis and Bart Foley.'Long Road' is probably considered to be less progressive than the 1970 lp,but more basic rock&roll.Or perhaps call it low-key progressive if you like.Some of the decently penned tracks I thought were ""Good Day To Die"",the title cut ""Long Road"" and ""Daylight Robbery"".Would be good to play on some of those late night FM classic rock radio shows.",3

"This was given as a gift to my almost-two-year-old. We definitely had to put some of the pieces away until later. The truck parts are great and he loves the excavator. One of the pieces of plastic has broken (one of the little knobs that insert to snap things together) and that was sharp when it broke, but overall durable so far. I have no real issue with the product - but for the price I'd probably buy some Plan toys or a little train set instead. If you can find it on sale it's a nice set. I'm sure we'll grow into it as well.",3
"This book took a long time to read, since it was exceptionally boring. Not to mention the constant typos and spelling errors all over the place (was this book even proof-read before press?? Sheesh! I eventually lost count.). The book doesn't really tell you how to start a business. All it really is a book full of the author's own photos along with countless interviews with other established photogs (mostly if not all Minneapolis-based) and some of their own photos. I read it all the way thru, hoping to find some insight on how to start my own business, but it never came. Just general things about the business itself and how people got in the photog business, and the authors own stories about hers. It seems to be more geared toward owning a studio since the author has 2 studios herself.",3
"I enjoyed this book however I think that it needed more information, especially when it comes to pricing products. I felt that the book needed more in that area. Overall it is a good read. I do think this book has great information and has enough to get started structuring your own business. So I would say for a starter guide, it's good. It answers questions that I hadn't thought of.",3
This is not a soup to nuts marketing strategy for building a photo business; it is a string of what works for others.,3
"Not the greatest. Has loosely based bible devotions and then completely unrelated ""facts"" at the end of each entry that have to do with science and animals- not as cohesive as I would have liked, and not as spiritual either, more of a general book on how to behave. Some of the situations mentioned are for kids a bit older, young ones will not understand.",3

"Unlike many adaptations, the movie Giant is far better than the book. I found nothing but flat characters and gross oversimplification of Texas history and culture. It was a quick read, but it certainly wasn't worth the time. I suspect that Ms. Ferber has written some excellent novels, but Giant is not one of them.",3
"This is a high quality solid wood frame that has a very formal, expensive appearance. It is all real wood, which is rare to find at this price. The overall attention to detail was not A+ ; my frame had areas where the paint was pooled, and it had one noticeable chip at a corner joint. The gold overlay was very nice and complimented the background color well. It was packaged nicely to prevent damage, so I suspect the chip appeared prior to or during the packing process. Not a bad frame by any means for this reaasonable price if it were not for the minor cosmetic flaws.",3

This isn't the best horror magazine especially in terms of interesting quality reading (Rue Morgue is) but it usually has decent features on new horror movies.

"Four of the songs on this CD, while good songs, weren't in the movie and songs that were playing up on the screen have been omitted.

Otherwise OK I guess.",3

"Anna Moffo had one of the loveliest soprano voices of this century. These arias from her long-overdue ""Beige Album"" are all performed excellently. She was equally adept in coloratura and lyric parts, and her high E's are just as beautiful as the rest of her range, including a warm, rich low register that could compete with many mezzo sopranos.Unfortunately, these songs all sound like they were recorded in a tunnel. RCA's ""Living Stereo"" releases, which include a lot of Moffo's work, as well as Leontyne Price and other well-known singers, seem to all have this problem. But if you can get past the echo, this is a wonderful album.",3
"I disagree that Moffo is the combination of Sutherland and Callas. In fact, she has never been in the same league. I view her as more like Leontyne Price try to be a coloratura soprano. Her coloratura arias are pale in comparision with the same ones by Sutherland in ""The Art of Prima Donna"". The best example is ""Bel raggio lusinghier"". It is obvious in this album that her technique was not secure and this is why she destroyed her voice so early. She was better in the lyric arias from Boheme and Turandot. Serafin's conducting was another problem. His pacing was not right for Rossini's or French operas. The sound was unbalanced recorded. If you are Moffo's fan or want to learn about Moffo's singing, buy it. But you will definitely find the same arias better sung somewhere else.",3
"I think the basic premise of this story is solid enough. Where it falls short is in the development of the storyline and its characters. For one thing, I think the main plot would've benefited if the story were a bit longer, allowing time to develop the relationship between Nevada and Eden and also adding more depth to the characters. In its current state, the characters seemed superficial and the story rushed. Most disturbing is Eden's discovery of her feelings for Nevada and after so little foundation on why that occurred. Eden and Nevada spend a lot of time together but the story skips through much of that and focuses on only sex scenes and sexy dialogue. For me, it leaves a lot to be desired.So, read this only if you can't find anything else better to do with your time.",3
"I eagerly bought this book based on the reviews on this web site. The main characters have great potentional however the character development isn't there. Eden was raised in Alaska and is familiar with surviving in the wilderness, but other than helping Nevada out of a tight spot early in the book, the book doesn't follow through with this line. Nevada has burn out and takes it out on Eden. Of course if I wanted someone to leave me alone I wouldn't tell them I desire them? And Eden what is she a door mat? She puts up with Nevada's rudeness and keeps coming back for more. Finally the book doesn't go anywhere. The characters are limited to a small area and have few challenges. I didn't finish this book I was so bored. Lowell should take lessons from Linda Howard.",3
"As a new brewer, this book has more advanced information in it than I need at the moment. It will be a good reference as I progress through brewing and gain more experience. If you only have one book on brewing to purchase, get Charles Papazian's first book on home brewing.",3
"This is Charlie Papazian's second book on the subject of homebrewing, following the in the footsteps of Papazian's immensely popular and useful debut, The New Complete Joy of Homebrewing. This book offers a lengthy guide to homemade beer, complete with reference material about the different styles of beer; how they are made, how strong they typically are, and other basics.Part of the reason Papazian's first book was so much fun was due to its writing style and humor. This, the follow- up, is more technical in nature and not quite as entertaining to read. It sticks mostly to the facts and leaves out much of the fun, making it a little more likely to induce sleep than inspiration. Nevertheless, this book is still useful as a reference tool and it does have some good beer recipes. Cheers!",3
"I was extremely disappointed in this CD. Heard this gal for the first time on the radio and loved her. So I ordered this CD really looking forward to rocken out in my car on a road trip. The CD has only (6) songs on it. And the recording sounds like it came from the basement or garage. I mean really 6 songs?????? Still think she has an awsome voice. Being a singer myself I can appreciate her talent.I will order another of her CD's unless they all have only 6 songs on them, if so will stick to the radio.",3
"Good '98 debut CD from this Scandinavian metal outfit.Tracks that managed to sort of draw me in were ""Deadnight Warrior"",""Lake Bodom"" and ""Touch Like Angel Of Death"".Only downside here is that 'Something Wild' has a total of seven cuts,with a duration of 32 minutes.Is this like an EP?Either way,it should appeal to some fans of In Flames,Kreator,Opeth,Mercyful Fate and Iced Earth.They're currently on tour here in the states,as I saw them earlier this year.They put on a great live performance.Go see 'em!",3

"I purchased this roller bag for my wife after having bought a larger, leather roller. She's very pleased with it and it's still small enough for her to pick it up and carry it, if necessary. While the size of the bag is small, it still fits her rather large laptop and all of her papers and peripherals that she needs. In fact, it's slightly smaller than her old, non-roller briefcase that she used to lug around.The only downside is that the bag isn't leather, which might stand up to the weather (snow, rain) a little better; probably not a huge issue, since the underside is hard plastic.",4
"Kensington Contour Balance RollerThis is a great, lightweight laptop bag. I was having trouble with my shoulder and back, so I tried this model.

"The camera has excellent video quality in low, normal, and high lighting. I wish it had a little higher zoom however trade offs must be made when price is part of the purchase criteria. The only real flaw of the camera is Nero the included software for editing and transferring to the PC. The software is difficult to use and is not the full version. So if you plan on purchasing this camera plan on purchasing some software if you are going to burn DVD's.",4

"Well i just bought the album yesterday, and was listening to it throughout the day today. It is a good mix of classic Rammstein as well as a few new musical elements. There is no topping Rammstein's old stuff, i will always love it. However this new stuff is quite good...a good change. I have a friend who is a big classic rock fan, and never liked Rammstein...he was pleased to hear the higher level of talent in this new album, when i made him lisetn to it. Definetly worth buying...Go Rammstein!",4
"I bought this CD with some trepidation because I didn't care so much for Mutter; I found it to be fairly derivative of older bands (Led Zep comes to mind).I've always thought that Herzelied was their best album: it's so raw and Til's vocals are really powerful. Reise, Reise definitely brings back the power that Herzelied evoked (Mein Teil & Moskau are fine examples), but at the same demonstrates a lot more sophistication in songs such as Amerika. In fact, it's pretty clear that the band is aware that they've achieved a kind of international cult status.Very polished and clearly shows a lot of hard work.Buy it: you won't be disappointed.",4
"I have always been a fan of Rammstein but I must confess that this is actually the first cd I have purchased of theirs. Mostly because I love the song Amerika. The song perfectly captures my sentiments about Globalization and the spread of American consumerism and capitalism.Also, it totally rocks.",4
"These guys are usually bad ass but apparently they've gone soft in this latest album. True, it does have some awesome songs like Mein Teil and Reise Reise but it also has some extremely lame songs like Los and Amerika. What were they thinking when they wrote Los? They sound like some old geezer band playing out of their rocking chairs. Also, what's up with Amerika? Apparently they broke their promise about never doing a political song and stooped to the level of the typical Euro-whining about America.",4
"Reise Reise is a good cd but I didn't care for track three Dalai Lama and track five Los. Rest of the cd though was a very good listen and the songs I enjoy alot. Amerika, Moskau, and Amour are my favorites on the cd. So if your into pop rock music and a few metal songs then pick this cd up and enjoy the music on it track for track song for song time and time again. By way side note your speakers will thump over and over again in your car depending on how loud you got the volume levels in your car. But if your like me you want to blast your rock and metal music or any music you love as high as possible.",4
"For everyone sayings its different its because it is. They wanted to try new sounds. They got some inspirationg from metallica, system of a down, and Slipnot. Still a good cd. Amerika is one of the best music videos ever made I think.",4
"This album does rock but I don't think it is there best.They changed there style.The first two albums sound nothing like there new stuff. I still like sehnsucht the best,because I like the catchier riffs. The new album sounds like a better version of mutter. It's still heavy and uses a lot of symphony and violins as backround effects. Another thing I like is the album is melodic.I would recomend this album but if your like me and you like there old stuff dont expect this album to sound old school.",4
"The graphics are awesome, very smooth, and very realistic war of fog. the only problem i had was the control especially when controlling different types of spells and switching weapons. eventhough it had the pause feature, switching speelbooks and spells was tedious. And i don't like the way you increase your abilities. You will only be able to increase your skill if you are using it, but it's kinda realistic.",4
"This game is pretty fun bys yourself but even more fun when you play co-op with some friends. I actually broke my mouse a few weeks back playing this game. It is really fun. The 3d isometric graphics are top freakin' notch as well as the spell effects.If you want a game like Torment, Fallout, or Arcanum. You will have to look elsewhere. But if you want a clickiy game like Diablo 2 but better (imho), then this is where you go.",4
"Actually, I really didn't like the game all that well myself. BUT, it's not hard for me to realize that's only because the gameplay doesn't appeal to me, where it would to perhaps most of the RPG gaming world. Control is smooth and intuitive, probably the best I've ever seen in an RPG. The graphics are also stunning and visually appealing. What I personally didn't like about it was the gameplay: to me it felt like constant hack and slash, where your basic goal is to kill scads of monsters and gather loot. And scads of monsters you will get. In my friend's words ""it's the Serious Sam of RPGs."" In contrast, what I'm finding I hold of highest importance in an RPG is the story line. For me, this one just didn't cut it.",4
"I played this game for a few days now. It's one of the best fantasy games I played make that one of the best comp games overrall, I got this for my birthday and I was so excited.It starts out with you being a farmer you have to kill enemies and you're given missions in the chapters as you go through the chapters you can get more characters into your fellowship. There are different monsters to defeat in all the different dungeons! Shopping is probably the best part (if you have money of course) I like to make them look buff and awesome! The downside is that the music kind of creeps me out and i get sort of tired of the dungeons get lost now and then run out of health potions, i start to get a little lonely, and i spend an hour or two on something that is kind of worthless, but play it on the weekends! Anyway all in all it's a great game have fun playing it!",4
"This game for all it's fun, is rather confining. You aren't given the opportunity to rove at will. I really like to be able to go anywhere I want to. In this game you have to go in one direction, fighting a plethora of creatures.The world itself is beautifully done, and the creatures you fight are some of the best around. There was basically no story, you just fight. For those who love a good Hack and Slash, you'll love this game. I found it exciting at first, but then that's all you do. No real puzzles to solve, no mysteries. Oh sure, you have the odd 'quest' now and then, but nothing that really challenges you.I gave this a four star rating because despite the linearness of it, I really enjoyed it.",4
The game is good but it is too short. I finished the game in three days. I expected it to be a little longer. 8(,4
The pace of this game is perftect. Fast enoungh to keep you interested but not laking detail. Play is a bit too linear but I have had several sleepless nights playing this one. Characters are easy to move and command. Money well spent.,4
"I have played alot of D&D back when dirt was young. Since then I grew up, had kids of my own, and watch them play D&D games that had whole different rules then when I played.I was truely unimpressed with many of the computer games to date, many were too difficult to understand how to make a correct character or were first person shooters. This game takes care of that yes it is somewhat mindless going from monster to monster but where this game exceeds is the multiplayer.I enjoyed the scenery and the point of view, the large map and the zoom on both. The game itself has some merit but the story line is thin.I am sick of first person shooters, I hope this game will be enjoyable to you as it was for me.",4
"This game is like another version of everquest, with no monthly fee and an offline play system. however, i would like more than 8 players in a group, and more variations of monsters.",4
"Nice graphics & sound. Slight issues with Windows Vista, but overall a fun game to play. I've been playing for almost 13 hours and don't even think I'm halfway through the game yet.",4
"This game provides hours of gameplay in which you battle everything from little dog-like creatures to skeletons to dragons. It starts you off as a farmer and depending on what weapons you use (bows, swords, or spells), you increase in that skill. You can combine the skills even to be, say, a healing mage who fights with a bow. Along the way you pick up companions who work in the same way, and you also recieve quests you can complete. Add this to a rich story full of dialogue and you get a great game. The only problem I have encountered is that you can't carry very much stuff, so you have to selectively choose what you want to bring with you. You can, however, have a donkey as a companion to carry your stuff. Also you can pause the game whenever you like, making the use of strategy quite possible and almost unnavoidable.",4
This wristwatch TV is a very attractive product but I doubt whether anybody would actually wear it on wrist as it is bigger than any other wrist watches available in the market.Unfortunately the TV reception standard used is NTSC(my country uses PAL) and hence the unit is unable to receive colours and sound.I would like to know whether anybody could suggest an NTSC to PAL converter which would enable the TV to receive colours and sound.My attempts to collect some technical information through the technical support team failed also falied as my emails bounce backed from the given tech team's Id.,4

"This headset works well with USB attachment directly into laptop or desktop for VoIP calls, WebEx conferencing, and for all audio. It has only one earphone but the sound is clear and ample (I am a multi-decade drummer/percussionist and motorcycler so my hearing is probably below the average for testing the sound volume and clarity). The 2.5 mm attachment also works well with my cellphone. It would be nice to also have the 3.5 mm plugin, but that does not come with the base unit - just the 2.5 mm and the USB. I highly recommend this headset as a cost-effective solution to VoIP and general audio output for laptops and desktops.",4
"I liked this headset a lot. Its says 3-in-1 i.e it works with cordless phone,mobile phone and PC (via USB).For me , it worked only on the cordless phone and USB.I talk for long hours still it is very comfortable.I did not give it 5 stars since it did not work with my mobile phone.I can hear the caller's voice but caller is unable to hear me.",4

The contents of this book will challenge you find out that there is more in your thinking tank than you can ever imagine.",4
"I am reading 'Juice - The creative fuel that drives world class inventors' by Evan Schwartz. The book gives insights into how creative people come up with inventions by creating possibilities, pinpointing problems, detecting barriers, applying analogies and embracing failures. The stories about how some of the inventions came about are really interesting. Schwartz goes inside the minds of some of the greatest inventors, delves into their stories and explores how they thought up their inventions",4

"I only wish the book had been longer. The writing is engaging as always, and this book gave a fascinating glimpse into the Benedictine world. The bit about Cappadoccia at the end (which I was very interested in, don't get me wrong) felt a bit ""tacked-on"" as if they needed to fill out a slim book.Very well-written, and I liked it, but again I wish it had been longer and in-depth.",4
Loved this movie. Jane Wyatt was fabulous. The storyline and the visuals were right on. A movie along the lines of House of Usher or Seven Gables with some good surprises.,4
"Absolutely fantastic book! Perfect for the platform shoe lover - especially me! Features the author's collection of platform shoes - including non-wearable novelties - leaving you wanting to own every pair on the pages! Divided into 8 chapters including ""Novelties"", ""Sling backs"" and my favourite - ""Ankle straps"". There are shoes with sculpted heels, beaded uppers, springs, wheels and every kind of fabric available. Also shown are the rare and hard to find products with pictures of platform shoes printed on such as record covers and even a jacket. Brilliant pictures, little text, not very informative but a good read all the same.",4
"The strings on this cd are artsy and groovy. The music reminds me of ""Watson & Co."" who used to play Houston art fairs, but with vocals. 900 Miles has a great coffee house sound, but has more variation with the world music flair. The pair are great together. Her voice is crystalic yet very real to believe. This is a good sound to sit and visit with a friend by, or reflect in the story the cd tells by itself.",4
"The TiVo is an incredibly addicitive invention. Once you have one, you won't be able to live without it. The ability to pause and rewind live tv shows, and a program guide that lets you record every episode of a partiular TV show, ensures that you will never miss anything on TV again. However, be warned before you pick up one of these gems. If you have or plan to get Directv, get a TiVo w/ integrated Directv or an UltimateTV system. Additionally, if you have a cable box, you might have problems getting the TiVo to work with the box. The TiVo needs to have full control over changing the channels in order to use all of its features. Additionally, you will need to pay a monthly fee to activate TiVo service. Despite these problems, you will find yourself willing to work a few extra hours a month to pay for the (...) monthly fee -- after all, you won't miss your favorite shows with TiVo at home.",4

"Haines gives an excellent explanation of systems dynamics. This book makes systems theory understandable, practical, and easy to apply. Haines provides models, tools, and explanations that help the reader put systems theory to use in personal and organizational development.",4
"I enjoyed this novel, and disagree with the reviewer who stated that it isn't spooky or scary and doesn't deliver at the end. I actual continue to see the last scene in my mind, over and over. That is the mark of a good ending.Are there problems with the book? Yes. Some of the situations seem dated, and maybe not as shocking to me if I had read it in high school. BUT, the way she used the frame of the book to tell three separate stories which do tie together at the end was very good and allowed for a different kind of character development. We see the main characters change as they see events next door.I read this book right after Shirley Jackson's masterpiece of haunted house books, The Haunting of Hill House. While Jackson's book is better, I think Siddons holds up well in comparison. I especially liked the idea of a MODERN haunted house. Nice touch.All and all a good, if not difficult, read.",4
"In this story houses don't have to have previous owners to be haunted. Anne Rivers Siddons suggests, like Shirley Jackson, that some houses are intrinsically evil and able to prey upon the weaknesses of unsuspecting humans. No motive is necessary, only the opportunity.The story is a little dated in its setting (Atlanta in the last third of the 20th Century) but story of the house along with the author's discussion of the worth of a small, graceful life, merits reading. The story is well-paced and the suspense tightens inexorably. This is not a story of gore but treachery, human weakness and how difficult bravery can be.",4
"I would never have picked up The House Next Door because I do not read books about the supernatural but when I heard of few remarks about how good the story was I figured I would take a chance.The title pretty well explains what the story is about ... The House Next Door. Walter and Colquitt lived a pretty quiet life. They had good jobs, a nice house, and friends. That all changed one day when the empty lot next to their house was sold and a young couple was going to move in right after the new house was built. Right from the start strange unexplained things were happening and Colquitt and Walter start to believe that the house is ""haunted"". Of course, all their friends thought they were crazy and they were suddenly the outcast of the neighborhood. The House Next Door is a page turner with just the right amount of suspense so you wont get too freaked out.",4
I couldn't put this book down. It had my full attention and then...the ending fell flat!I think the author ran of creativity!,4
"This was the first Anne Rivers Siddons book I read and I did enjoy it. It was a scarey story about a plot of land that was developed (the last one in the neighborhood) and anyone who lived there had horrible things happen to them. Three different families lived there and things escalated and got worse. The closest neighbors, the Kennedys, were aware of each family's problems starting with the first couple who built the house. They also befriended the architect. With each move a different neighbor got involved with the new owners and they would also get sucked into the nightmare happening. It was never explained why this was happening and it had to be stopped or would keep happening. This story kept you on the edge of your seat until the end. I would recommend it to anyone who likes suspense along with the paranormal.",4
The book On the Far Side of the Mountain is an instant classic. This book keeps me on the edge of my seat. When Sam loses his best friend and greatest survival tool it looks like that is all the book is going to be about. It turns out that Sam learns to survive all over again on new places of his mountains. He also learns how to use a sling (like in David and Goliath). Then when his voyage was complete he found himself in a mess of criminals and thieves. Read it!,4
"My Side of the Mountain by Jean Craighead George is a very exciting book. The main characters in my book are Sam Gribley, Frightful, and the Baron Weasel. This book is about a boy who is tired of living in New York and runs away to live in the Catskills Mountains and needs to learn to live in the wilderness. While he lives in the wilderness, he meets many new friends. He learns to live in the wilderness and use natural resources. But then people learned about him and then a problem started to sprout for Sam. If you like action and adventure this is the book for you.",4
"Dear Jean Craighead George,The book ""my Side Ofthe Mountain"" was a great book. I can't believe how Sam had survived from the forest. I loved how you described the details about the forest and everything that Sam did. The food recipes were good.Sam had a falcon named Frightful in this story. Was this story true? What a wonderful adventure!",4
"Sam's parents never let him go camping, so Sam ran away. Sam use to live in Delhi, NY. He went to his grandpa's land in the mountains. Sam burnt out a giant Hemlock Tree and lived in it. He made a bed, snare, deer trap, deer skin coat, deer skin door, and deer skin underwear. Sam got a falcon named Frightful. One day, Sam heard sirens. He hustled to his tree and saw a stranger was sleeping by his tree. The stranger's name is Mr. Bando. Sam became friends with him. Mr. Bando was a songwriter. He sang great songs. Sam said,"" He liked them"". Sam made a fireplace to keep him warm. In winter, trees were freezing and falling! Will Sam live through the winter? I recommend My Side of the Mountain to all readers, because it is adventurous.",4
"Sam, a 13-year-old boy, wanted to live in the mts. near Dalhi, NY, off the land of his grandfather. His parents let him. "" He will be back soon,"" they said. They knew he would be back in day or so, but he wasn't. He wanted to remain for a whole year! So he attempted to pile wood. He made a house in a tree and collected food, more wood, and sassafras for tea. He worked on this for a couple of days and soon finished! He shared his tree with a chickadee he called Barometer. He lodged by a rock that had a weasel that he named the Baron Weasel. Sam caught a baby falcon ,so he could train her to get food. He named her Frightful. About two months later, Sam met a guy named Bando. He was a teacher. Bando and Sam spent Christmas together. A year was almost up. Will Sam make it? Will he stay? You will have to read My Side of the Mountains to find out. I recommend this book to all readers, because it is suspenseful and exciting.",4
Sam is a boy who ran away from home because his dad said he would never last two days in the wild.He wants to prove his dad wrong so during the night he leaves home and heads to the wild.This is a good book for someone that likes books that have a deep thuoght to them.I would recomend this book to anyone that likes any book.It always fits.,4
"I just finished Jean Craighead's book My Side Of The Mountain. It was an excellent book. It was about a kid who ran away from house in New York to live on his own. He is trying to find his grandfathers old land he used to own on the Catskill Mountains. If you like to read adventure books,and survival books then check this book out. In my opinion this is one of the best books i have read in a long time.",4
"I read the book my side of the mountain by Jean Craighead.this book is about a yong boy named Sam Gribley who runs awayfrom the city to live alown in the Catcills Mountains.Sam Gribly goes through many changes while living in the the book my side of the mountain in the Catcills is very diffrent from the city where Sam used to live.The city is crowded and busy,in contrased the catcill mountains are calm silent and peaceful.sam can no longer buy clothes from deer hides.i feel that the moral of the story is this that if you try hard enough at something it will work outI think that everyone should read this book because it makes you think about how hard it is to live in the mountains all alone.if you are like me and many others you will like this book because i think everone has thought about runing away from home one time or another.",4
"Okay, this is technically a book review for my homework from academy. This fantastic book is about a young boy named Sam who was tired of city life. So he runs to the mountain with a penknife, a ball of cord,some of flint and steel, etc. He tries to find Gribley Farm, which is a farm that Sam's great grandfather made. So later, he finds a giant nest with one egg in it. Then later it hatches and a baby falcon comes out and Sam takes him and later turn friends. Sam now meets new people and learn new things and has to survive storms and etc. This book is a 4 star book and I recommend you to have this book on your lap in the next 24 hours after you read this review.",4
"I gave this book a 4 because I thought it was interesting, and Sam had many great adventures in the wilderness.",4
"HELLO, MY NAME IS TIFFANY AND I AM HERE TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE BOOK MY SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN. I LIKED THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT TELLS YOU ABOUT THE DANGERS AND EXCITEMENT ABOUT THE WILD. IT TELLS YOU THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW AND FIND IN THE WILD AND WHAT TYPES OF FOODS TO EAT. IN THIS BOOK SAM USES A LOT OF CREATIVITY AND I LOVE A LOT OF CREATIVNESS. I THINK THIS IS A GREAT SOURCE FOR CAMPING, OR IF YOU WANT TO LIVE IN THE WILD LIKE SAM.",4
This book has a lot of adventure and excitment. I would recomend it to somebody who has an open mind and is very adventurous. Once you start reading you can't stop because it always has a new adventure in the next chapter. I think I could surrive in the wilderness now that I have read the book.,4
"My Side of the Mountain is an outstanding book. It is a great adventure for all ages. It's a momentous, exlerent, thrilling adventures in the deep of the Catskills. The book revolves around a young city boy who decides to venture out to the wildeness of the Catskills, on his own. He discovers many of the thrills of the wilderness and meets many new friends. He battles the dangers of the winter. He learns about his life in his adventure.",4
"This book was given to me and my class in Grade Six. In the beginning everyone thought it was going to be boring. Once we started to read it we realized it was great. After that our teacher took us outside to try and make some of the tools Sam used. Our class even spent the night in the woods to learn how Sam felt. We all had a terrific time and began to look at the book differently. It wasn't just make-believe, but realistic situations.",4
"I can still remember my grade school librarian reading this book to my 4th grade class. I was BORED silly for maybe 5 minutes....next thing I knew she was closing the book and we were sent back to homeroom. Every day to follow I couldn't wait to hear more of this story. Thank goodness she sat us down and read it out loud. I don't know if I would have picked it up on my own at that age. Yes, the premise a bit implausible. Trite perhaps. But for the age of person for which it was written, it is sure to draw him in.",4
"Sam Gribley from My Side of the Mountain by Jean Craighead George is an outdoorsy type of boy. He ran away from home to find the Gribley farm and found some unexpected friends.One of these friends happens to be a hawk named Frightful. He also encounters a group of birds that remind him of his neighbors back home. Another friend is a savage weasel that he calls the Baron Weasel. There are also others, but you will have to read the book to get to know them better.This book is very informative for a realistic fiction. Sam's knowledge of the great outdoors keeps progressing throughout this wonderfully told story. This book is sure to astound you.If you want to find out how long Sam will last all alone in the wilderness, then you will have to read this book yourself. It caught my attention and I enjoyed every minute of it. I hope you enjoy it too.Emily, A 6th grader",4
I read this book for school and I thought it might be a little boring but I was wrong. Good job Jean:),4
This is a great book. I loved the story and how he thought how to use everything he saw to his advantage. Highly recommend.,4
"My Side of the Mountian is an extraordinary book written by Jean Craighead George.A boy named Sam Gribley decided to run away from the city. Nobody believed he would do it, but he did. Sam built a house, found a stream, and found food. But Sam is lonely so he captures a peregrine falcon and trains it to get him food and so he's not so lonely. I recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure books. This book is as good as Hatchet.",4
"I love this book because it has a lot of action and adventure init. I love action and adventure. I recommend this book formostly everybody, whether they like excitment or not, it isstill a good book for mostly everybody!",4
"As I say in my title, it was okay. I'd actually say more of a 3 and half than a four. The book is about a boy who ran away from home and decided to live in the woods. I think that it's very good compared to another one of her books, Water Sky (which I also reviewed). Jean Craighead George does a decent job on this. There just isn't enough action in it to keep me enthrawlled.",4
My Side of the Mountain is a great book. Jean Craighead George must have spent a lot of time in the forest. Her descriptions of the landscape and anecdotes regarding the animals are vivid. The only thing that doesn't ring true is the fact that a young kid goes and lives on his own in the wild and no adults appear to be concerned. A very enjoyable read.,4
I thought the book was sad in one part when Sam took Frightful from her nest and away from her family. But I thought it was good in the end when Sam's family came to live with him. I liked most of the book and I would recommend it to others.,4
"I really liked this book, it taught me some really interesting facts about the how to survive in the wild. I never relized how hard it is to live in the wild. You have to know alot about it, like what you can eat and what you cant. I dont think I could ever live in the wild .Although I enjoyed reading this book. I thought it was very informative and interesting.",4
I found the storyline to be quite original at its time an to be an overall great story,4
"My Side of the Mountain is about a nameed Sam Gribly. He runs a way to the Catskll Mountains. He gits rides all the way there, wants he is there he finds a gint Hemlock tree digs the old rotin wood out then burns the rest out, he makes lots of usful tools and gits a pet falcon, gits books from the nere by town's library.",4
"I thought this book started out making me feel interested to keep reading the book. I like how the author put interesting details to go along with the informative ways to make assorted things ranging from food, all the way to how to make a home in a BIG tree. It`s also interesting how he finds his pet and trains it to do the things he wants it to. I would love to have the skills he posseses. And the way he deals with the assorted animals is really amazing, and how he makes freinds with alot of them. And then there is the wide variety of animals that were mentioned.What I don`t like is the way he almost lets his self get found and how he just went home when his mother said so. He could have at least resisted a little. Well I am a 12 year old boy and there isn`t much for me to say so I give this book a 4 star rating and tell the author ""GREAT work an the adventures and animals-i just didn`t like the ending.",4
"The fictional story, ""My Side of The Mountain"", by Jean Craighead George is an adventurous tale about a 15 year old boy--Sam Gribley--who decides to run away into the Catskill Mountains of New York. He makes some unexpected friends along the way. Frightful, Sam's pet Falcon, is loyal and acts as a security alarm by squawking at approaching dangers. The Baron, a weasel, and Bando, a human, are also very well written side characters. The ending is disappointing and leaves the reader feeling empty, so perhaps the resolution will be found in the sequels. ""My Side of The Mountain"" is a fun story for children 9-13 who wish they could escape into the wild.",4
"If you are thinking this book is about someone who owns a side of a mountain, you're wrong. It's about a boy who lives off the land. This book was a little short and it needs more illustrations to help the reader picture what the author is talking about. But the story teaches survival techniques and it's a book you can't put down until you find out what happens. So if you can read for hours on top of hours and even if you can't read that long, You Should Read This Book!",4
4 stars My Side of the Mountain by Jean Craighead GeorgeMy Side of the Mountain is about a boy named Sam Gribly that runs away and lives in the wild on Catskill Mountain. He studied survival books to be ready. He makes homes out of many things. He is very creative. I would recommend this book to 4th grade and up. tp,4
"I've read My Side of the Mountain dozens of time in my life. It's a fun book to read and you learn a bit about nature, but the way the book is written, some of the characters, and the unbelievable elements of the book detract from the overall reading experience. Sam's friends are pretty gay, and there's no way any parents would let their son run away. I find it hard to believe that he survives the winter all alone in the mountains. Sam is a pretty thin character. In this book, they all are. I think it's gay how Sam names all the animals. This book is worth reading. It's entertaining, and fun to reread. Give it a try, just don't expect too much. I've read the sequel, On the Far Side of the Mountain. Parts of it are good, but it's a strange story. Not very engrossing. Trust me.",4
My Side of the Mountain a very interesting book. The bookwas about a boy named Sam. He runs away to the Catskill Mountains. There he starts life near a small creek . Later on in the book he hollows out a hemlock tree and decides to live there. He also takes ababy peregrine falcon which he names Frightful. Frightful is proven to be useful because she catches food and is a good companion. I think this book was exciting. It was exciting because he has to get deer from hunters and try not get caught. I recomd this book to other 6th graders. I hope you read this book.,4
My side of the mountain is a book about a boy who runs away and lives off the land. he has many adventuresand discovers new things. If you want to learn more about this book i suggest all 6th graders to read it.,4
I thought that this was a good adventure book. There are some surprising turns throughout the book that keep it exciting. Some parts were corny but others were thrilling. It's about a boy that runs away from the city to his Great Grandfather's old farm and lives in the woods. He catches a baby falcon and teaches it to catch food for both of them. It is a good book I give it **** stars.,4
"It is about a boy that runs away from home and tries to survive. He gets a new best friend and learns how to survive off the land.I'd rate this book 4 star out of five, because the beginning started out slow and kind of confusing. I liked how it got sad exciting and had mischief.",4
"I first read this book when I was about 11 years old. Back then, it was my favourite book. I really admired Sam for having the courage of his convictions and live off of the land. Some 21 odd years later, I read the book again. To my surprise, I have a greater admiration for Sam and his decision to runaway and live in the Catskills Mountains now than I did when I was 11. I think that few adults would have the audacity to leave the conforts of home and live off of their wits. The thought of failure would be enough to put them off. This book left me with an immense sense of liberation and adventure. It will not be another 21 odd years before I read this little treasure again.",4
"My sister says this book describes me to a tee. Well, she's always had the better memory of our childhood days.I didn't start talking until I was 4, but started talking in complete sentences right away. Like Sowell's (too) many examples, I had speech therapy classes in elementary school, was unusually fond of mathematics, and wound up working on computers - before they were common.This is a must-have book if you have an inquisitive son who can take apart anything and can communicate without talking. Don't let the public school labellers label him learning disabled or autistic. He'll turn out fine without their ""help"".",4
"When I finished reading this book the first time, I was nearly in tears as I had read a description of my late talking, uniquely talented preschool-age son. The book gave me hope, advised me of questions I could ask in helping my son and directions to go to learn more. I believe his work in this area is the first step in the study of these unique, late talking children.",4
"This tub is great if you're concerned with space. I can let it dry, fold it up and put it under the bassinet in my room so it's close at hand for the next bath.On the other hand, the water does spill over where the notches are to fold the tub if you fill it a bit too much. You can't add very much water because of that. Otherwise my son seems to like it and I haven't had any safety problems what-so-ever. As far as putting it in the sink, I wouldn't do that with any tub. It doesn't seem safe. Therefore I place the tub on the bathroom counter next to the sink.",4
"Love this CD! It is chock full of catchy melodies and trippy lyrics. You will hear these songs in your head for days! Much better than their other CD. For $2.50 (postage included), it's a bargain.",4
"As you know, little whit lies have a tendency to turn into big problems, and so it is with Pippa. The plot is believable but quick enough to keep your full attention. I like my characters to sound like someone I would like to know and I would like to get to know Pippa a bit better. I look forward to her next adventure.",4
Lovers of Joao's smooth jazzy sounds will love the ballads on this album - at least 4 tracks - of which Vida Noturna and Transversal do Tempo are notable.,4
"Unusual in the sense that these true-to-life people seem to be living in some kind of Chinese paradise--complete with pristine streets, sensitive teachers, a modern tram, lots of good food, stylish clothes, American slang and some latent appreciation of democratic values. From an entertainment perspective, these kids and their parents are truly a hoot! Recommended.",4
"This is an awesome game, I don't care what anyone else says. The graphics are decent, but not perfect. The story line sounds like something you'd hear on CNN and leaves a bit to be desired. The reason I like this game so much is the ability to go anywhere, do whatever, and blow up everything. It's the perfect game to end a long day.Overall, this game wouldn't win any awards for being unique in any way, but it's one of the best mindless distractions available for PS3",4
"Not the best ps3 graphics but it came out a long time ago. Definately worth the $10-15 it's going for now a days. I haven't gotten the online to work because my ISP blocks p2p ports such as are used by this game, but the single player is a lot of fun.",4
I like this webkinz alot it is very cute.But it took forever to get here I was very mad.It's smaller than I thought it would beand I know it is a lil'kinz.And it's fur where the mane is sticks up.over all it's agood toy,4
I like the webkinz very much it's very cute. I'm very mad becauses it took forever to get shipped evon when was it took forever to be deliverd.,4
I would have liked to have stories about illnesses also in the book. Also couple mistakes found. But still good value for money.,4
Great hard-back book with many large quality photographs. Also a nice range of graphics from packaging to architecture design. Fun to look at over and over again. A nice addition to your library.,4
"This is my favorite ""recent"" addition to my fragrance stock. I feel I can wear it either day or night. I rated it a '4' as it doesn't last long, but still plan on purchasing a larger size.",4
"The Blochs' translation is concise, elegant, and strikes the right balance between contemporary explicitness and classical reserve. Some of the textual choices are debatable, and the translation often departs from literalness, sometimes omitting entire lines -- but the overall result is fresh and exciting; this nuanced rendition really brings the Song to life.One thing to be aware of is that, other than the poem itself, a brief introduction, and some brief remarks by Robert Alter, the text consists mostly of very detailed translators' notes analyzing the verses line by line, even word by word. This material will be of interest to scholars of ancient Hebrew but perhaps not to the general reader. I read the book (sans notes) in about forty minutes -- and I have to wonder if I should have paid [amt] for the privelege. Nothing against the Blochs or their fine work, but I would have preferred more supporting material of more general interest.",4
"Four Big Sheriff's Stars for this production! I love westerns, particualrly set in this time ""when the west was young,"" the 1860's - loved the soundtrack, loved the stark natural locations, loved the wit and literacy of the dialogue. The story moves right along, the characters are interesting. The director and writer draw us in to a world transforming where silly harmless pranks evolve into deadly serious crimes. I am getting to be a bit of a ""cinema geek"" in spotting tiny details. The handguns, nearly every one I saw, were 1873 model Colts (or a similar configuration). The time setting was for the film was 1863 - full decade before such firearms were available to the public. That's my only beef.",4
"This is a good but unusual western that is more realistic than your typical western. Worthwhile, if your not expecting ""young guns!""",4
"Circle II Circle is a band totally flying under the radar. If you are a fan of Heavy Metal, Hard Rock or Melodic Rock, this is a band you need to check out. The vocals are strong and powerful. The musicianship is also quality. Who am I To Be, A Matter of Time & Sentenced are really strong songs. The band keeps the song first and foremost and the band members will each get their moment to shine through out the record. Once again this is a REALLY good band. It is a shame the music industry has went the way it has. This is a band that should be HUGE. Very few people by albums now. They just want a single....so sad.",4
I'm a major Twilight fan and LOVED Breaking Dawn Part one in theaters. I pre-ordered my dvd as soon as Amazon listed it online. I'm anxiously awaiting its arrival.,5
THERE ISNIT MUCH TO SAY OTHER THAN I AM A TRUE TWIHARD FAN. THE MOVIES HAVE NOT DISAPPOINTED ME. WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
Well acted; scenery amazing. Great special effects. Followed book very well. Well worth seeing again! An absolute must for Twilight fans of all ages.,5
"This movie is as good as the past movies. I am looking forward to the next. The download was super fast too. I was so nice to be able to watch a movie on my Kindle Fire in the car, it made a long trip much better.",5
"I was originally introduced to the Twilight Saga series by a girlfriend, who finally convinced me to watch the first Twilight with her. I entered into the movie with a preconceived bias that the series was a teenybopper thing, but changed my mind during the viewing. Plot development was good, the setting (Pacific Northwest) was very suitable, and the characters were endearing in their own weird way. I am now a fan, and can't wait for the release of Breaking Dawn pt. 2. Good seres, I recommend it.",5
Awesome movie; must own all series. My next purchase will be the entire book collection. I am anxious to see what happens next.,5
The product got here quickly and in good shape and it is a great movie from a great book. This was the best movie so far out of the series.,5
"This book is excellent and I recommend it as a MUST read for anyone considering doing any business in Moscow and to a lesser extent other cities of Russia. I lived there for two years and had my own fair share of bizarre business experiences and even a dose of ""Moscow Madness""...don't ask! This book is full of well told true episodes of how Russia was in the 90's.",5
I like working on my photos with this program. I haven't had any problems. It works great for me. Have made some really nice pics for printing.,5
Delivery of this product was super fast 3 days!Very user friendly contains more bells and whistles than products costing 10 times more.Good results allt he time either printing editing can't go wrong.probably one sugestion pity it was not readly available in UKOtherwise don't think about it buy it you will not be disapointed even works with microsofts rubbish Vista,5
"It's so much easier to use than Adoby Photo Shop and way more affordable. I purchased this product three times, and have most of the editions.",5
"Easily one of the top true crime books I have ever read. Corwin has an eye for detail but doesn't get bogged down in minutia or wordiness. The pacing of the investigations lead to many, ""ok, I'll read one more chapter then quit"" episodes. The detectives' sense of humor and dark view of the underbelly of society is genuine and genuinely funny. Even the best fiction does not grab my attention like Corwin did. This work is on par with David Simon's ""Homicide."" Simply put, a must read.",5
"I love Alison Davis's workouts; especially this one. She gives good instructions, though it may still take a few runs-through to catch all the steps. But while you're concentrating on learning what comes next you forget about how hard you're working. Before you know it you've had a great cardio workout! The dance steps are a nice change from typical aerobic moves. This DVD adds great variety to your routine. Buy it!",5
hi-lift jack base... Heavy duty plastic and jack fits perfectly in it. Used it on the sand to jack my 7000 lb truck without a problem.,5
"Very solid, and heavier than I expected. It does its job spreading the weight over a larger area to prevent sinking into soft ground. The jack itself is fine if being used on a hard surface.",5
"Tommy Sancton is a new discovery for us (and we are experienced jazz buyers, having more than 1,000 CDs). We enjoyed this disk, partly because it is not simply a compilation of the songs everybody records: only five songs are standards, and there are songs on here we had never heard. Just wish Sancton would make more CDs.",5
"For anyone who is interested in learing about The Orishas or the Religion, this is a wonderful story to read.",5
"Clear and condensed teachings and thoughts helping readers grow in Bible knowledge and holiness, and God's truths to apply in daily life.",5
"I have been using this for about two years and it is the best product I have found for oil control. I have VERY oily skin, and this takes the shine beautifully. You may need to apply twice a day and blot here and there, but its worth your money. I can go about 6 hours before I need to reapply it. If you have ever cried because you cant even rest your forehead on a flat surface without leaving a slick.. (gross, I know) try this and cry for the right reasons!",5
If you have oily skin then you know how disappointing it is when you buy an oil control product that does not deliver. And they normally never do. But this product really works. My skin is extremely oily so I have to apply this product 2-3 times per day. But a little goes a long way so you don't need to apply alot. And it is not too drying either so no flaking or irritation. This is worth every penny.,5
"I've been using this for several years and I adore it. i have really really oily skin that nothing else worked on, and this stuff totally controls my oiliness. I used to use a half dozen blotting sheets a day, and I haven't had to use one in years. The bottle lasts forever, too.The only problem with it is that it leaves white streaks, but I find that a little pore minimizing moisturizer on top of it fixes this problem, and is good for my skin, and makes my pores look better.Everyone needs to buy this so they keep making it!",5
"I was never much of a strokes fan, but this song defienetlly got me into them. Its mind blowing.",5
"I have been doing this DVD for a little while now and I find it very enjoyable.True that it is not a workout for hard core power exercisers, but it is fun and gets you moving. You are finished with it and onto cool down before you even realize that you have worked your heart rate up. I also like the fact that this workout was a bit gentler on my joints than some of the other's I have tried.The music is good, the cues are good, the instructions are clear and understandable, the scenery is lovely. Great beginner workout or it would be a great workout for days when you want something a little bit more mellow than a pounding FIRM workout.Even my teenaged daughter does this workout with me and enjoys it.After you know the routine, there is an option in the special features that allows you to turn off the cues and just do the workout to music... nice!",5
This workout is a fun way to change up a boring workout routine but you still get a good workout.,5
"I loved her since her first DVDs ""Hula Workout"" though those used cutsy 60s music & added 60s american dance moves but still have a lot of authetic hula dancing.These ""Island Girl"" hula workouts are more authentic. Just like her other ones, you get a great workout, your abs burn, your hips, legs get a nice workout. It's all authentic dance moves with some added quick squats, etc. added in so you barely notice it for adding toning. The authentic drum Hawaiian music is beautiful & does keep you stimulted too keep going just like a dance/rock beat would.I had no trouble following & learning the steps, there are plenty of dance DVDs that I have had trouble with, but she breaks everything down well & shows it slowly several times before speeding it up. She even cues YOUR left & right, not hers.There's a trailer for her ""Hula Workout"" DVDs & another authentic Hula workout like this called ""Island Girl: Hula Abs & Buns"" at collagevideo com",5
This DVD is a great workout! I enjoyed the hula moves and really felt them in my abs and legs the next day. The DVD is also fun to watch because the background behind the instructor is so beautiful! I would highly recommend this DVD for anyone who wanted to try hula and get a great workout!,5
"For a while i thought i couldn't draw. Then i got this for christmas. w00t! Hart does such a great job showing the reader how to draw! Maybe its the fact that my porportion drawing sucks, because the wonderful world of chibis actually encourages the artist to make a fat, big headed, short limbed character! My drawing are adorable now! The book takes you step by step until you;ve reached max cuteitude! If i had known it would rock so much, i wouldn't have waited!",5
"After doing the preliminary sighting in at 20', I was very pleased with one particular pellet. It has a copper bb on top of a lead base. Other style pellets were not giving me consistent groups. I moved my target out to 64' and fined tuned the back sight. Acorns are starting to fall, so I used duct tape to hold one on top of my card board box. The first shot poked a hole in the acorn at 64'!",5
Krups ice-cream maker arrived quickly. It is easy to use and best of all the recipes are great. It was recommended by a friend and I am glad I took her advise.,5
"Written in English, this is probably one of the best modern naval technology magazines, discussing technology, weapons, ships and includes sections in the back for brief world news and industry news.",5
This is such a good collection of S&G's music. It's one of the few CD's that I love every single song. I am a new fan of their music and it really got me into it. The CD is just plain GREAT!,5
"This dresser was an absolutely perfect size for our spare bedroom. It is very well constructed, drawers open very easily and it looks great! I do recommend this dresser.",5
"Fire Within presents a sensitive and critical rereading and reconstruction of the stories of four women in the early church: Tabitha(Dorcas), Lydia, and Priscilla as they are presented in the Acts of the Apostles, and Phoebe as she is mentioned in the Epistle to the Romans. The book highlights their spirituality and explores their experiences and missionary activities in the light of the challenges posed to church and society by third-world women today. The chapters not only discuss the lives of these women disciples but draw our attention to the all-too-similar experiences of discrimination, prejudice, injustice, and oppression which form a disturbing and poignant parallelism between these biblical women and their sisters today. As a way of deepening the reader's spirituality and Christian commitment, each chapter also includes suggestions for prayer and reflection as well as for Christian praxis. -- from book's back cover",5
"I'm suprised that so many people gave this movie a bad review. My boyfriend took me to see it because I had mentioned I wanted to go, and when he and I came out we both loved it!! It was fabulously written, Kate and Luke have great chemistry together, and we never even saw the ending coming.I can't wait for it to come out finally!! I've been waiting MONTHS since I saw it in the theatre for it to be released!!",5
"This movie had everything that makes a great ""date"" movie. There is comedy, romance, and a happy ending. Not to mention that the guys will love Kate Hudson and who could not like Luke Wilson?",5
A very good purchase. It was bought for my oldest daughter's birthday and i know she will be delighted to receive it.,5
"Excellent movie!* I can only say it reminded me of another great one- Pretty Woman. Finally- someone has recaptured the theme of that great one.* (And funny the actress in both are really named Julia.*)Julia Stiles again shines-a true talent. (As she also did in Mona Lisa Smile*- -with by the way, my all time favorite actress, Julia Roberts*)This was a fantastic movie all the way around.*Thank you all* who made it come to life.*(And keep up the good work... there are those of us out here who love it.*)",5
"I am very satisfied with the product, it arrived before the time expected and I proved that it was in great shape.",5
"I was expecting a fairly superficial movie that was mildly fun. But after the scene in the laundry room, the movie suddenly shows a lot of depth. The two leads really pull off that this is a real, deep--even a bit selfless--love going on here. The movie even deals a bit with the real problems involved in such a relationship. But, what I really liked was that each person (Paige and Eddie) was the better for knowing the other. They grew each other up into better people. Most romance movies don't have that at all.",5
"I downloaded this on a whim looking for another romantic comedy and glad I did. Some may say it's sappy but I think that's the point. It was fun and in many ways typical of real life in college life and small towns. Royalty doesn't mean much if you can't do the real dirty work and understand the plite of the ' little ' people. I do wish that they had used the original cast in the sequels: Julia Stiles (whom I've always loved as an actress), Luke Mably (more believable as a prince to become king), Ben Miller (always a pleasure to watch) They had a chemistry together and were more believable. All in all a good film for all to watch.",5
"In this romantic comedy about the daughter of a Dairy farmer and the Prince of Denmark who will one day be King. The couple meet when Edward comes to the US to go to college... and that is where the fun begins. He is paired with Julia as a Chemistry Lab Partner and he's almost constantly late for Labs.If you liked Julia in ""Save The Last Dance""... you'll love her in this film. It was one I thoroughly enjoyed and have watched again and again.Hopefully, you will too!",5
"I thought that the movie was a great one. It took a while to get going but when the ball got rolling, it kept rolling. At the end you think you have it figured out but then it takes a turn for the worst and you think it might end so you get upset. But then it all works out. So I think it was a great movie because any movie where you can predict the ending just isn't a good movie to start with.",5
"I love this book. I have trouble with memorazation. This book keeps my interest. It s very easy to read. I like that.It is an allegory in christian form. There is a girl named named ""Grace and Glory"". She was formerly ""Much Afraid"" in the book ""Hinds feet on high places"" which I would recommend also. Anyway in the book ""Mountain of Spices"" she helps her relatives- to follw the good shepherd-Jesus and get to the ""high place""I am not positive what that is. It could be heaven- or to be saved.it s very enjoyable reading. it is fun reading. Not boring or authoritative. Think of a book like ""Nancy Drew by carolyn Keen- It is fun, easy reading like that.The author of ""Mountain of spices is Hannah Hurnard.Ths was a paperback. It did not cost much.",5
"Fresh out of law school Sash is ready to take on the world as well as be a sister/mother to her five year old brother Sweet. We know the best laid plans of men and women go astray. As Sash plans crumple in front of her face, she finds she has to trust the powerful, rich, handsome, and cocky Brandon Plain.Brandon and Sash's inability to trust each other hampers their ability to work together thus causing more problems. When they stop thinking of themselves and realize other lives are involved, they see good results on the horizon. As in life another monkey wrench is thrown in the mix. The pain for Brandon and Sash is over bearing. There were sections in the book where I found myself saying oh no, or damn; my facial expressions went through some heavy changes as I read Sweet Sacrifice.Ms Rhodes has done a stupendous job of keeping you on the edge of your seat, waiting to see if the characters can become a family.Reviewed by Toni Bonita, APOOO BookClub",5
i had searched everywhere for this movie and finally found it. I love it! Thanks amazon!,5
The Natalie Wood was miss cast for this role she.The Katharine Bard appears to be far to old for the role of Raymond Swan I think this was why she was ignored.I did not enjoy Robert Redford performance I found it lack creditability.I really enjoyed Christopher Plummer he showed more than one side to the character. He showed a caring side and also showed the double standard side. Why did he not get A Golden Globe nomination.Linda Colliver,5
"It's always amazed me that this movie doesn't get more respect--sure it's campy but the performances are fantastic: Christopher Plummer's speech to Daisy by the pool after she's been abandoned by her new husband (a super young Robert Redford playing gay for God's sake--what more could a person ask?) is stunning and Natalie Wood's breakdown in the sound booth is incredible. Roddy McDowell's snarky secretary! Redford getting off lines like ""Good night, sweet, sad, lonely lady"" and Malora (great name) screaming at Daisy ""I'VE GOT A HEARTACHE!!!"" The gorgeous black and white video of Daisy singing and bouncing her way through the galaxies. All incredible stuff--why isn't this on DVD yet? Same goes for another Hollywood classic: Joan Didion's ""Play It As It Lays"" with Tuesday Weld and Tony Perkins. Wake up, Hollywood, and give us these treasures on DVD!",5
Although power is limited It easily runs the cooler (micro refrigerator) in motel rooms overnight and powers/charges anything that you might put into your car's cigar lighter when you don't have your car in the room with you.,5
"An all-star cast, but best of all, Siegmund Nimsgern as Kurvenal. Nimsgern is a superb Wagnerian bass-baritone, not to be missed, as well as the rest of this stellar cast. Buy!!!pwk",5
"I was surprised when my two wastebaskets arrived that they were larger than I had expected from looking at the photos (it helps to look at the dimensions first!) but they worked out just fine and I really like the look of them. They're sturdy, practical, and attractive.",5
"If you don't listen to a lot of 1940s music, you may not appreciate the significance of this album (actually an expanded set built around Sinatra's landmark 'Sing and Dance with Frank Sinatra' album from Columbia). This is a fun album, though, and Columbia's first-rate production is worth buying.'Saturday Night', the opening track, still sounds great. 'When You're Smiling' gets great orchestrations behind FS' great vocals. Of course, there were plenty of dumb songs around in 1950 -- 'The Hucklebuck' is inane, but even here Sinatra is strong, it's just that he is wasting his voice on a forgettable song. 'Farewell, Farewell to Love' and 'Lover' are nice, and 'All of Me' holds up well after half a century.Modern listeners who might find the (excellent) 1940s Columbia recordings kind of sappy will find this first 'swinging' Sinatra album to be more palatable. If you are a serious Frank fan, this is essential.",5
Brought back lots of wonderful memories and was able tointroduce it to my 8 yr. old son who absolutly loves it!Design of the jacket was beautiful also.,5
Step back in time to witness adventure through the eyes of Johnny Quest. This dramatic but fun series genrated for kids captured many an adult who watched it. Filled with adventure and excitement this cartoon ranks right up there with landmark series like The Jetsons and The Flinstones. I thorougly enjoyed revisiting this wonderful series.,5
"I've watched a handful of the episodes in this newly-released set and my opinion is that they are superb! The sound and picture are excellent, and I even like the box. This is Hanna-Barbera at its finest. The stories and characters are as interesting as I remember them being when these episodes first came out back in '64. Would the kids of today get into this stuff? Just ask my 13 year-old son who had to be pried away from the TV at bedtime. Buy it today!",5
"Having purchased this box set on a whim, I am glad I did! This set brings back great memories. It does however have a voice edit on the Ho-Po show. I believe however, that the person who thinks that the ""shadow of the Condor"" show was edited has mistaken this episode with ""The Dark Tower"". The Dark Tower has the scene that shows the Nazi soldier throwing a hand grenade at the Quest team from his plane when they are trapped on the side of the mountain. I don't recall a scene ever in""shadow of the condor"" that has the pilot throwing a grenade. I may be wrong but I believe this set is complete and unedited except for the voice editing on the Ho-Po showing.You wont be disappointed with this purchase. It will bring back many memories and is quite to fun to watch even as an adult after all these years. Get it you wont regret it!",5
Jonny Quest Was One Of My Favorite Cartoons As A Kid. If You Are An Adventure Cartoon Fan This Dvd Set Does Not Disapoint.,5
"I'm not old enough to have watched these during their original run but I did grow up before Cartoon Network had desolved completely into the mindless (and PC) mess it is today. Jonny Quest is still my favorite cartoon. I'm having a blast rewatching favorite episodes and I've ""found"" quite a few episodes that I've never seen before.",5
"The fabulous illustrations in this darling book delight small children, who have a way of making a mess of themselves, literally.Jessie loves messes. She's into crayons that color the edges of her paper and keep going--onto the table--and big red dots on her face and hands. She can't contain her yogurt in a cup; it spills.Her dad says, ""How about a carrot, my Messy Jessie? A carrot's not messy."" When he runs to answer the door, he comes back to find that she has dropped an egg on the floor, dumped out the milk, catsup and mustard, stepped in them, and is dancing about singing ""Messy Jessie!""The cat and dog lap up the mess, making footprints and pawprints all over the floor.""This isn't funny,"" says a dad losing patience.She takes a bath and goes to bed. ""I love you my Messy Jessie,"" says her dad.But she even dreams of messes. The message is real for children of a certain age.And of course, it's the dad who takes care of the messes.--- Alyssa A. Lappen",5
"I had recently watched Alexa Vega in ""From Prada to Nada"" and I liked her acting. She is funny and believable. She and Luke Arnold did not disappoint me in this story. They played these rebel teenagers that get in trouble but what comes out of that is beautiful and inspiring music. Definitely a must see!",5
"Great karaoke game. I really like the settings and the ability to create your own character, too.",5
"This is an extremely moving story. I have the VHS. We need a DVD, Amazon !!!",5
"As a college student, I found RtI to be overwhelming to research out of books and on the internet. This DVD covers everything with a straightforward, comprehensible presentation. The animated representations of concepts make things very easy to understand while the narration goes over the specific details. I'd recommend this for any college students preparing to become teachers. It will give them a good basic understanding of RtI BEFORE they enter the workplace.",5
"I bought this for my sister who was recently diagnosed with cancer. This is an easy read, carefully written, practical step by step what to expect, helps walk the patient through the process. Highly recommend this above all other books on the subject.",5
"I aggree with most of the other reviews: you or your partner must read this book when breast cancer is diagnosed. It gives your clear information about you chances and options. For me, it convinced me to make a girl friend ask for a second opinion, which led to another treatment with better chances. And it gives a lot of information about the drug Tamoxifen, which is used quit offen in treating breast cancer.",5
"This is the best resource book that I found for guiding one through the scary world of being diagnosed with breast cancer. It is easy to understand. And, while it is not too technical, it does give good information and explanations of all the terms, tests, medications, etc. I highly recommend it to anyone going through the fight, or to anyone helping someone navigate those waters.",5
"I've used this on about ~10 occasions for very light work on my motorcycles.Seems solid, quality made, very portable, and does the job right.",5
"Thank you Karen for having the faith to find Martin Grey and helping him to get his book republished! I am so very proud of your enormous effort. This story has brought me an understanding of the events of the holocaust I never thought possible. I think with understanding there is a deeper appreciation for what ACTUALY happened. I pray God will not let this happen ever again. We must never forget. With each generation I see a loss of understanding, not that we don't teach history. But, an emotional understanding that comes from real life accounts such as Martin's. Thank you Martin, Karen, Mark and all that put this together!",5
"The question as to the accuracy of all of the facts set forth in this book becomes almost irrelevant as one reads through it. Unquestionably most if not all of them ring true. What absolutely kept me glued to this particular book written about the Holocaust was its amazing ability to, through it's candid, brave telling of this remarkable story of one man's life, impart upon the reader subtle and not so subtle lessons about human life. The book's undeniable impact upon the careful, attentive reader speaks for itself. In my opinion, this book should be read by ALL students everywhere seeking truth, knowledge, equity, justice, and human rights.",5
"A vivid narrative of the destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto and all its horrors...Gray pulls no punches in painting the beast, the victims, and his own actions in the fight to survive. A must read!",5
"How can people question Martin Gray's story, it's just beyond my imagination. Ridiculous and pathetic. Martin Gray is an amazing human being. If anyone is doubting the story, do your research instead of writing stupid comments on a review.For those I loved is a book which follows me everywhere I go.",5
"I read this book after stumbling across, and very much enjoying, the Botany of Desire by the same author. Pollan's perspective on nature, culture, and the garden's place in both is fresh and extremely well written. This book is both challenging and fun; anyone with even the slightest interest in the sciences will like reading and thinking about the ideas he gives.Pollan's ability to describe people and gardens is worthy of a weekly newspaper column next to Dave Barry. I keep his books on my shelves for re-reading on a leisurely day.",5
"I read Pollans ""A Place of My Own"" and couldn't wait to read his first book ""Second Nature"". His writing captivates me and I hope he writes many more stories about anything. He's a wonderful teacher, story teller, yarn spinner and his inquisitive nature struck a strong cord. All my friends and relatives will get to enjoy it as a gift from me. Thanks Michael for a great read",5
"Few snapshots as realistic or compelling exist to show the daily grind of Palestinian life in the face of unrelenting Israeli oppression under occupation. Watch the film, visit Dheisheh, and learn to love the amazing Palestinian people, who thrive so mightily while living under the thumb of their morally bankrupt neighbors.",5

"Alright, so before making the purchase I read all the reviews on here, and half of them are complaints about how this condom will make your penis numb, and you won't feel anything at all. With this climax control condom on, I can go three times longer than without it, that's how good it works for me. My girlfriend was pretty happy. Now about the issue of condom making your penis feel numb, it's suppose to do that! lol. But I can still feel the great sensation of the intercourse. Remember, this is meant to make you last longer, it DOES NOT make you stay hard longer, there's the difference! So if you have erectile dysfunction to begin with, obviously putting this numbing condom on will make your case even worse; you need something like viagra not a numbing condom. Again, this product is for normal healthy men who don't have problem staying fully erect, but just ejaulate early, so this condom will make you stay fullly erect longer.",5
"My husband buys these to sell to his friends and he sells them by the hundreds.... I have never tried them, he calls them the magical condoms.... but all the comments I get are excellent, men using this product last a lot longer, over an hour in one sex session, but need to take it out in order to ejaculate, because it kinds of numb the penis.... I guess at the end just use a bit of imagination, and change to oral....",5
"I don't have the single (yet) but I've got the album (Movement...) and it's also on Sasha's GU Ibiza CD2 (another incredible album, by the way). This is one of those songs that you never get tired of, like Flaming June. I wish I could spend a day/week with Brian in his studio just seeing how he creates all this beautiful music.",5
"My husband and I first discovered these after dinining at a local ""better"" restaurant. They really have an intense flavor. Honestly, ONE is completly satisfying. A ""serving"" is 13, which I have NEVER consumed in one sitting.. 2-3 is the most I can handle and usually come away with felling somewhat decadent, they're so rich! After losing weight, I was searching for a ""diet-friendly"" chocolate, but the ""diet"" chocolate foods at the local grocers and via ""weight-loss systems"" just cannot satisfy the palate! Well THIS is for YOU. The flavor is TOTALLY CHOCOLATE-MINT and you will be completely satisfied with just a few! Super high flavor and super LOW calories/carbs!",5
This is a most excellent film! I took a course in Native American Representation in media. This was by far the best of all. It is deeply moving and gives an excellent portrayal of what these schools were like for the children. I would highly recommend this film!,5
"This album is one of favorites.... It very up lifting music and it songs is different and enjoyable... I love her music!!!! Her music has change my life in so many ways as I have growth with it for this 7 seven year of my life... Its another great album, straight out of Bahia... Axe Axe... Viva carnaval brasileira.... Eu te amo voce Daniela....",5
"Black Moon and the rest of the BCC cooked up a classic w/ this album.....The beats are all dark, grimy , and laid back....This album is remenicent of Wu-Tang and a lot of that dark,grimy hip hop that was coming out between 93-95Theres so many classic tracks on this album and NO FILLER....Make sure to download or somehow check for their remix to ""i got cha opin"" bc its even much better than the original...",5
CLASSIC.LYRICS ------ 10/10PRODUCTION COURTESY OF DA BEATMINERZ ------ 10/10THEME -------- 10/10ALBUM COVER ------ 8/10CONCEPT ------- 10/10STAND OUT TRACKS ------ ALL TRACKSOVERALL -------- EXCELLENT.O.KAKA aka God's gift to the underground.,5
"Classic classic classic. There is no other way to describe Black Moon's debut opus. Strictly boom bap, real hard beats and real rap. Buckshot was like John the Baptist to me when this record cameout (Nas was Jesus!). The Beatminers killed the soundscape. I don't care if they were just looped and filtered, the samples where f!@$in' incredible. Buckshot carried this record on his little a$$ back and you could almost track his lyrical maturation from the first cut to the last. ""Buck Em Down"" is one of the hardest records ever made. Other standout cuts include ""N!&&az Talk S#it"", ""U Da Man"" and the unf@&kwitable classic ""How Many Emcees"". The remixes they came out with after this album dropped were damn near better than the originals (check ""Buck em Down"" and ""I Gotcha Opin"" for proof positive)! Cop this immediately and rock it in th 0- seis like it just came out Tuesday! Real hip hop. Period.",5

This is one of the basic creams that you will need for wrinkles! Great price! and it works great as compared to expensive products that do the same thing.,5
"I only bought this to complete my Universal Monsters series, but it's actually a good collection. The first movie is a landmark because of the brand new special effects. As old as this movie is, they hold up to this day. The other movies, while not exactly sequels are interesting,too. Universal Monster fans should get this set. They will not be disappointed.",5
"Invisible Man - The Legacy Collection (The Invisible Man/Invisible Man Returns/Invisible Agent/Invisible Woman/Invisible Man's Revenge)This set is excellent,love the old time ""Corny"" horror movies.They are good for us ole timers to watch.None of the ""Blood and Guts"" they put in the current movies.Buy ""The Legacy Collection(s)"",and enjoy",5
"It is without a doubt a classic. A great film, but the DVD has a lot of specks and white spots on the print. I know the film was made in 1933. I just wonder if this was really the best print or if it could have been cleaned up better. Anyway, I'd still buy it.",5
"The Invisible Man is a great horror movie. It introduced Claude Rains to the world and created a fun franchise for Universal pictures, the monster movie giant. A scientist studies night and day to find the clue to invisibility only to experience success on himself. Unfortunately with time, it drives him a little mad too. So the monster show begins! The other films are interesting and professionally made but not up to par with the great original The Invisible Man. Quirky and of interest, I mildly enjoyed them and appreciated them for what they were. Probably good shows for the kiddies on Saturday afternoons. Great collection.",5
"While the reproduction on sale on Amazon is dated 2005, the book was originally published in 1981, so it predates Coox's ""Nomonhan"" (1985). Glantz (When Titans Clashed, page 324)calls Drea's book ""the best short study on Khalkin-Gol...Alvin D. Coox, ""Nomonhan: Japan Against Russia"" is an exhaustive study, but is told almost entirely from the Japanese perspective.""Note that its fairly pricey for a slim paperback.",5
"A psychologist recommended this book to me when I was having serious trouble handling the challenges in my life. I kept spiraling into deep depressions. Applying this book's principles helped me keep my head above water. But you have to keep practicing these principles, or they stop being effective. These principles become a way of life.",5
"Too often, comics are thought of as ""kid stuff"". But Rick Geary has created a well-researched account of the infamous Borden murders in cartoon format, & it is useful for adults & children alike.Filled with illustrations dervived from old photos, maps & blueprints, the reader gets an excellent feel for the events.It is also well-written. Geary makes plain many features & details, such as the oppressively hot Summer temperatures (this kept most people off the street), the single eyewitness that saw Lizzy in the yard, clean & un-bloodstained, & many other documented facts that are neglected or ignored by careless or less objective authors.This early era in American History come across well, & the cartoon approach makes the ""horse & buggy"" period comprehensible to the Internet Generation.The Hipster gives it a Big Thumbs UP!",5
"Bass Junkie is Phil Klein, European Electrobass guru, who got his start on Dynamix II records with this album. Good stuff.",5
"So, I recently bought a few of the Blu Rays in this pack, but I wanted a complete collection. This has it all and in a good transfer quality. My favorite will always be Spaceballs, but the others are fantastic as well :) If you like Mel Brooks, you'll like the Mel Brooks Collection.",5
"This set has some of the funniest movies of all time, and I must say i was not disappointed. The films look great, Silent Movie and Robin Hood especially. Since I had only already bought Blazing Saddles, I didn't mind that some of these were the same as earliar releases. If you don't own many or any Brooks movies, this is a prefect set to get. Lots of laughs, and the discs play great. Some have complained about the little boxes, but I was happy to see them. It beats the often used paper folder style boxsets that Buffy the vampire slayer used(those tended to wear out pretty fast if you watched them as much as i did) while also preventing this set from being unweidlingly huge. Compact sixe for lots of laughs while ensureing that all of your movies are protected. True, there are not many special features, but it's the movies that are the value here, and for this price i cannot complain.",5
"If you like Mel Brooks, get it. Wide screen and everything, despite descriptions to the alternative. It's good to be the king:)",5
Excellent collection of Mel Brooks movies. Gave it as a gift to my daughter for Chrsitmas and we laughed all day watching the movies. The special sale price made the collection an even better buy. A real enjoyment that will keep you laughing.,5
"Not much to say here,I saw a great deal of the day on the Mel Brooks blu rays for under $30 and had to pull the trigger. Not one bad movie in the bunch!",5
I have not had a chance to watch these yet. I have seen all the movies and wanted the collection. The packaging and product seem to be of very good quality.,5
I bought this for a friend and watched it with him. I knew it would be bad and it was. I guess if you like this kind of thing then it would be good for you. I on the other hand have taste.,2
"Bad special effects, a completely wooden plot nailed to cardboard characters, bad acting and cheesy gore effects do not compliment would could have been a very scary movie. Inexplicably incestious Cat people live like cia undercover agents in a small town, and stake out victims to gain energy. There is no explanation as to what these creatures are, and basically the whole thing is a solid vehicle for a bunch of scenes involving painfully conspicious latex prop limbs being torn and split while the creatures feed off of the energy of fresh victims (one scene where a man has his hand cut off actually rivals luke skywalker's incredibly unconvincing appendage loss in ""The Empire Strikes Back). The cat people themselves are reminiscent of japanese rubber suit monsters (one almost expects power rangers to jump out) and the morphing special effects look ridiculous. Entertaining enough to warrant watching the whole thing ... even If not for any reason it intended to be.",2
"Well the it starts out pretty good. the plot is alright, the actors are pretty good and the special effects are amazing for when it was done. Then in the end it all gets wacky... almost like a comedy. One scene when the seriously dissturbed mom (Alice Krige) kills a guy whit a corncob! But when it really gets bad is in the end when you see how the ""sleepwalkers really look...",2
"It's terrible! About the only thing it had going for it were the special effects and the musical score. Don't get me wrong, I love Stephen King, and I love scary movies, but this one is just plain sick.",2
"This CD just about drove me nuts. I understand that rain is to be expected in a rainforest,but after listening to this recording my pets were lining up two-by-two. This CD is for you if you love a long rain and dripping sounds. I hated it; it was monotonous and I could swear that there were portions that were repeated because the person recording it had to fill up some space and nothing was available.Save your money!",2
"This book is not an easy read; to many diversions within the story to get excited about the character. It hurt my ""head"" to try and stay with it. I enjoy reading, but this book takes the joy out of reading! It has taken me months to get to the 6th chapter",2
"Very average movie, Jonny Debbie as wonderful as ever. If you want to see it then rent it, not a keeper",2
"Yes, Johnny Depp provides another great performance here, as does most of the cast. The story line is what drags this movie down. Beyond the slew of predictable lines and scenarios, I found the message of the film a bit shallow. ""Love conquers all...including schizophrenia."" It's just not life-like. Some of the imagery and allusions are heavy-handed at times. I wanted to scream, ""OK, I get it."" Not a terrible film, but not that great either. If you want to see a more compelling Depp film, see ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape.""",2
"Benny (Aidan Quinn) is the brother of an autistic girl named Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson). He's a bit restrictive and protective of her. Sam (Johnny Depp), the ""quirky"" guy, moves in. Hilarity ensues. So, what's the problem? The moviemakers were not content with making a funny, lighthearted movie. Instead, the movie gets very serious and preachy about several points - whether or not Joon can live on her own, whether or not Sam needs to get a job, etc. These questions are presented as ones with obvious answers, because, of course, love conquers all, as we learn in Hollywood. Sam is portrayed as the truly wise character of the movie, while crazy old Benny is still stuck on backwards ideas like earning money to provide for yourself and caring for the mentally handicapped.There were a few funny parts, courtesy of Johnny Depp, but I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie.",2
"Although Johnny Depp is to be lauded for his deft physical comedy in this romantic fairy tale, it isn't enough to save this implausible film. Depp plays a somewhat eccentric young man who finds himself filling in as a ""housemate"" to a young mentally ill girl who lives with her brother. Mary Stuart Masterson is effective as Joon, and Aidan Quinn does her sincerest best but the film ultimately fails in its ignorance of reality. Julianne Moore has an early appearance as Ruthie, the failed actress who works as a waitress and befriends Benny, Joon and Depp. The movie manages to sugar coat mental illness and we're asked to believe that this obviously disturbed young girl is capable of living on her own. While its message of love conquers all is admirable, the reality of Joon's situation is overshadowed by this sentimentality.",2
"what a boring and pretentious movie! after tortured about 15 minutes, all the family members started to look each other or one another, then all agreed at the same time to reject this stupid shallow movie. depp or no depp, after twenty years, he's still playing the similar roles again and again, and never grows tired of it. but to me, and to us, enough is enough.",2
"This book was okay. It spoke about how gays deal with sexual orientation issues in the workplace. The good thing about it is that it included case studies of a gay black man and a bisexual white woman; so the authors were trying to think about diversity within the LGBT community. However, this book is simplistic and doesn't say much. There are large-scale studies and anthologies out there about gays in the workplace that are more thorough, and just better. You should consider reading this, after you've read all the other stuff on the topic.",2
"Let me just say, I loved the movie Pearl Harbor. But I found the soundtrack to be disappointing. I bought it for the Faith Hill song ""There You'll Be"" If you are like me, I recommend the single.",2
"The so-called soundtrack for ""Pearl Harbor"" is a major disappointment. The film was full of great period songs and music. None of them are on the soundtrack. Instead, you can enjoy an hour of absolutely forgettable, mediocre orchestral background music. OK, the theme song is stirring, at least the first two or three times. But the rest is a real bore. When I want to listen to orchestral music, I go to Bach, Brahms and countless other true pros. Don't get bamboozled by this one!",2
"While the movie Pearl Harbor is amazing, the soundtrack does not follow suite. It begins with a mediocre ballad by Faith Hill and the remaining 8 songs, while nice to listen to, are not Hans Zimmer's best work. Tracks 2-4 are so similar it's hard to tell accompanies the numerous TV trailers. For a 3 hour movie, I them apart. It does not include the powerful music that expected a much longer soundtrack. I'm sure we'll get more music when a follow up CD is released. One will no doubt be released so that consumers who want a better soundtrack have to shell out more money.",2
"I bought this CD for Faith Hills song and hoped the rest of it would be good also. For a movie like this, and an event like this, the music just doesn't fit.There should be some very big, building music here and there isn't. It could have been much better.",2
I was disappointed in this soundtrack. The introductory and final songs were lackluster sentimentality. I would have hoped for something more from the producers. The instrumental offerings lacked excitement and musical tension. I would have though Zimmer would have known better.,2
"Zimmer mostly just rehashes past themes from other films he's done, then throws in a track collaborated on with Faith Hill and some generic period-type music. Big deal. The film stunk and the uninspired score just had me thinking how much better the other films he's worked on were. Zimmer's better than this. The same can be said for most of the directors he usually works with. Perhaps it was just a paycheck to him...who knows.",2
"after last year's majestic score for gladiator, i had high expectations for the pearl harbor soundtrack. much to my dismay, the music no more than ""sorta pretty"". it evokes no feelings like gladiator's worldly mood. plus, with all due respect to mr. zimmer, the defining chord sounds awfully familiar to a Enya song some years ago (i think it was enya). i don't need the faith hill song...... plus, unlike the gladiator score which the listener could visualize the story, the same isn't true with this release of the soundtrack. PLEASE GIVE US MORE MUSIC WITH A SECOND RELEASE!!",2
"Having read Ms. Manning's book, it is obvious that she has somehow managed to overlook perhaps the most important pioneer and innovator of what she calls the ""free energy"" movement:JOSEPH W. NEWMANIt is incredible to me that she could write such a book without including Joseph Newman's long struggle to bring forth his revolutionary technology. Writing such a book without featuring the work of Joseph Newman is as ridiculous as writing a book about the history of aviation and omitting any reference to the Wright Brothers.I would suggest that she view his website videos at:... and perhaps she would discover the essential nature of his successful and innovative technology.Gary",2

"One month ago (and even earlier) this set was selling for less than half ($41) this current price ($89). While it was a great series that I thoroughly enjoyed watching as a kid, my desire to finally buy it for Christmas has been completely eliminated by the equivalent of holiday induced price gouging. I'll wait till it goes back to a reasonable price. More than a little upset with Amazon over this one. Merry Chri$tma$.",2
Unlike most SciFi shows this show had NO BASIS IN FACT. I must have been much more forgiving as a kid I remembered liking this show at least a little but after watching it again the bazaar story lines and unforgivable scientific inaccuracy I have to give this a total thumbs down.,2
"Not sure whether the original recordings were not preserved well or just our copy is bad, but the sound cuts out frequently on each episode. Would not buy this again.",2
"Even while some of the episodes are questionable and not very realistic, this is a classic show now. Having two seasons, the special effects of the time is still top-notch. While the acting is mediocre, and the story set up is sometimes way out (It was the 70's) there is some entertaining value. As a writer, I still look through this medium to see if there were any parts that can be embellished for newer ideas. What toppled the ratings of this show was the ""Mind"" entity beings that appeared on the first six or so episodes. But after that the writing started to switch to a more action oriented show. I am still looking through the DVD's as I try to remember the better episodes. Quality of picture is fine on widescreen TV's, but this is not an HDTV product.",2
"I found the book to be very general and basic. Most of the information I already knew. There are methods of retrofitting old windows I have seen on home type programs that lightly discuss these topics and which the book does not. Also, the book could use a lot more diagrams and discussions on finishes and paint. The book limits itself to actually restoring to original working condition old windows and nothing about updating. This book is for beginners except that for beginners there should be a lot more pictures. I did find some good tips but not the information I was personally hopeing to find. I am selling the book back.",2
Goes a mile wide and an inch deep. I would rather the same book but each chapter by an expert in that area with a lesson/example.,2
"The FM stereo does not pick up well at all. I cannot get many local stations. The description says it uses USB 1.1 for quick transfers. This is misleading advertising. USB 1.1 is the slower transfer method. USB 2.0 is the faster one.Where this device excels is in conjunction with a MP3 player. The rechargeable battery means you can use it away from a power supply for a long time. The sound is excellent.This would get 3 stars due to the slower transfer speed, false advertising, and poor FM. It gets 2 stars because the price is too high for a refurbished model.I got this for $19.99 directly from Philips web site. I would check there first.",2
"Ok, so I have not actually heard this WHOLE cd. I did hear Bob sing on The Bachelor show and was impressed, but then I heard ""his"" first single, Girlfriend, and was less than impressed. This is for two reasons: a) Bob doesn't really have the rock vibe, which just makes his version of Girlfriend sound wrong (in his defense, the song I heard him sing on tv was Open Arms by Journey, an excellent song, and not easy to sing I don't think). b) I can't deal with the fact that I have not heard Bob publicly credit the originators of the song Girlfriend. The July For Kings version is 100 times better than Bob's, and while I know the band probably appreciates the publicity, they are not getting all the credit they deserve. Check out JFK's cd ""Swim"" and make your own comparison, though if you like Bob's single this CD will likely not disappoint your tastes.",2
"I kinda liked this book for awhile. Some strange humor and interesting to see what is was like to travel at the time of Twain. I thought it was a litte long and boring and though (only read 3/4 of it). Not very exciting and a lot of quotes from other esoteric sources. Also, he makes reference to Arabian nights while in India. Aren't those stories set in the middle east and north africa? (kinda lame)",2
This was a great deal if it had worked. The gas regulator had leak by when set to zero. Amazon was not good about sending a new one they said the price had gone up and I would have to pay the new increased price. I just got a RMA and returned it. Could not get the seller on the phone. Tired of messing with it went to welding supplier and bought new. Some things just should be bought locally.,2
This product does an adequate job of cleaning your feet and does provide some relief for tired aching feet !,2
"I pre-ordered this foot massage spa to relieve niggling pain in my feet. Though the product operated exactly as per the manual, it was rather tame. It didn't really help reduce the pain, rather it merely tried to soothe the feet. Your feet will feel good so long as they are in the spa, but the spa does nothing to reduce the pain. I didn't think its worth spending so much money to just put my feet in hot water (& that too without salts). I've returned the product.",2
"Bought this unit directly from Brookstone over 6 months ago. Was initially great very hot water and jets were comfortable but stopped working after 4 uses. Brookstone would not replace because after it was after ""limited"" warranty coverage. This was an expensive unit and not sure if I would get another one from Brookstone or try cheaper model that hopefully won't break down.",2
I loved the idea of this foot bathbut the product leaked. Brookstone was great to work with for the return.,2
"I purchased this item thinking what I read about it here on Amazon would be true. Unfortunately the heated foot bath and Message is not what it sounds like. The heated part works ok, but as far as the message part, not even close. And the jets, come on, give me a break. For what I paid for this, over $100.00 and the most expensive one that Amazon had at the time I thought I would be getting a good foot bath. If I had to rate this from 1-10 I would give it a 3. Only because it does keep the water warm. In my opinion it is not worth the money or even half of what I paid for it.",2
"Bought this thing as a gift for my wife. She was really excited to get it. Used it twice, with out any salts, and it worked great. Third time she went to use it, the jets didn't work. Got a hold of the company who sold it, and they said no problem, just send it back. So I'm thinking they are going to send me a new one, that works. Made me pay the return shipping, and just put the money back on my credit card.If I sold a defective item to someone, I sure as hell wouldn't ask them to pay for return shipping.",2
"By the time this 9th entry in the Jason Voorhees franchise was released, the series had become tired and ultimately redundant. In an effort to put more life in it, we are faced with a Jason who is killed but like in THE HIDDEN (a far superior film), he manages to live using host bodies. Although the screenwriters try to give us more motivation for Jason's murderous rampage, there is little suspense or novelty in the movie. Jason manages to kill off a few people, and his sister is recruited to finish him off. No real acting honors in this one, although Steven Culp manages to do well in his role as a tabloid tv producer. The ending is a joke in itself, with its reference to future Jason adventures. Not the best in this series.",2
"I cant beleive they did this, they added a crapy plot, ""only a vorhees can kill a vorhees"" WTF??!!!!???!! jason had a sister? what a stupid plot, then at the end you see freddy's hand grabbing jasons mask and pulling it down under the ground (telling me freddy vs. jason is next).if you want to collect the friday the 13th film's i sugest part's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and X.",2
Yes part 9 or Jason goes to hell is a classy entry in the series.Jason's soul jumping from one body to the next might seem ridiculous but they have tried everything else.,2
"Well, I thought Friday the 13th part 5 was bad!? This is the worst ""Friday"" by far and it's only redeeming quality is the nice DVD release and the fact it opens the door for Freddy VS Jason! For that reason alone I rate it 1 1/2 stars!Unfortunately Freddy VS Jason was shelved for many years and was released after Jason X?! Which doesn't make any sense, so we have to pretend that Freddy VS Jason came out before Jason X to have this even begin to make sense.(I use the term loosely!) The only postive thing I can say about this film is that it's got a way too good DVD release and it makes Jason X and Freddy VS Jason look all that much better!I was really disappointed with this entry even though 'Jason Takes Manhattan' isn't much better! If you want to complete the Friday the 13th series, it should be seen as it does set up the superior sequel 'Freddy VS Jason'.",2
How could anyone think that Jason was dead. That killer in it was smart in saying he's not but what makes the world think he can stop Jason. I was really disappointed with this one even though my standards for Friday movies are extremely low. I really only watched this for the end part when Freddy's hand pulls Jason into hell and belive me it wasn't worth it one bit.Another horrible thing about this movie was it's cast. That fat diner owner was so stupid with the whole Vorhees Birger and Jason fries. When Jason came in there I was so happy when all of them were killed. This one was really disappointed when I saw this and it isn't even worht the two star rating I gave it.,2
"I have always been a fan of the Friday the 13th series. I'd seen each of the movies a dozen times, but had somehow missed this particular movie. I barely even remembered hearing about it.I finally got to see it a few days ago and, wow... I mean, I honestly gave this movie a chance. I really did. This installment into the series is what PART 3 was to the HALLOWEEN series. Jason is barely in the movie. When you do see him, his makeup job is so weak that he becomes more comical than imposing or frightening. Now, I love Kane Hodder as Jason, but the acting in this movie is absolutely bottom shelf. There are a few decent visual effects, yet there are more than enough cheesy effects to counter and totally eclipse the good.This is the 2nd ""mulligan"" of the series: along with part 5, fans will wish they could simply remove them from the series and forever forget them.",2
"Jason, the living, breathing essence of evil, is back for another fierce fling. Tracked down and blown to bits by a special FBI task force, everyone now assumes that he's finally dead. But everyone is wrong. Jason has been reborn with the ability to assume the identity of anyone he touches. The terrifying truth is that he could be anywhere. Or anybody.One of the weaker installments in the franchise. The one bright spot in the film is actor Steven Williams (who would later play the role of ""Mr. X"" in the series ""The X-Files""). His character is interesting, and he plays it with energy and comedic touches.",2
THIS MOVIE IS THE WORST OF THE SERIES. JASON IS ONLY IN 2 SCENES THE BEGINNING AND THE END. THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE MOVIE HE IS POSSESSING PEOPLE AND CONTROLLING THEM FROM INSIDE THEIR BODIES. THIS MOVIE BLOWS PART 5 IS BETTER AND TAT BLOWED TO 5 IS BETTER CUS THEY ACTUALLY HAD A JASON LOOK ALIKE AND U FIRST THINK ITS JASON. I GAVE THIS MOVIE 2 STARS CUS OF THE AMOUNT OF GORE IN IT.,2
"First off I LOVE THE ""FRIDAY THE 13th"" FILMS!!, but as a movie fan this is BY FAR the WORST ""Friday"" film off them all, turning one of the most popular slashers of all time into what looks like one of the ""ALIENS"" after bursting through a chest and then having him switching from body to body ala ""Invasion of the body snatchers"" has to be ONE OF THE WORST IDEAS IN MOVIE HISTORY!! About the only thing that was semi enjoyable in the film was the end and I wont spoil it for you guys that havent seen it. I gave it 2 stars, one because the movie is watchable and the other because im a fan of the series. If your a collector of the ""Friday"" films its a no-brainer to get it to complete your collection. If you're looking for a good horror flick...STAY AAWWAAYYYY!!!",2
"Now I know that horror flicks aren't supposed to make alot of sense, but there comes a point where leaving too much unexplained and unaccounted for detracts from the quality of the movie. And that is the case with this film--how does Jason have a long-lost sister? What is the Necronomicon doing in the house? What's with the bounty hunter and his special dagger? Not very well thought out.",2
I watched the special features of Jason goes to hell. They said this is the end of all Jason movies. Ya ok.... do they really think the way they ended it no one is going to think of a way for him to come out of hell. If Jason was able to come from hell to grab his hooky mask and laugh about it. I'm pretty sure that mean's he will or can come back from hell. But nice try on trying to end this movie. Which by the way is a big change out of all Jason movies. What is the big changes in this movie compared to all the others? Well Jason is able to kill living in different body's.,2
"this movie was almost as bad as ""Jason X"" (quite possibly the WORST sequel to come out of any movie ever - and ive seen major league 2: back to the minors).this movie forces you to sit through an hour and a half of boring ""weve-seen-this-before"" horror movie cliches only to find the best bit of the whole thing is the last 30 seconds.however, if youre a die-hard fan of the friday the 13th series (which means you should have seen this years ago) and actually had to pay to see Jason X, this movie is for you - but im sure youll agree with me.",2
What's wrong with the screen? It's too bright. They were REALLY struggling to keep FRIDAY13 alive by this point. So much so that Paramount gave up on it. It's their own fault for not making them better than they should have been. My Friday the 13th rewrites will be 10 times better I promise you that.,2
"I will have to admit, this film is pretty good but they stole their idea. The film ""The Hidden"" was just like this. Friday The 13TH Part 9: Jason Goes To Hell was a copied movie. The Hidden was a great movie. The Hiddden was made in 1987, Friday The 13th Part 9 was made in 1993 so you can tell the producer of Friday The 13TH stole their great idea. Friday The 13th Part 9 is alike to The Hidden because they have this killer that hops from body to body by spitting a snake alien thing into their mouth and then the one with the snake alien thing is the new killer. ...",2
"People that give this movie a good review,forget what the story is about.You can't follow the same storyline for 7 parts and then screw it up with Manhattan and this scifi bodysnatching garbage.Two stars for begining and ending and it's apart of the greatest horror legacy,so I do have it in my collection.",2
"when the movie had been started for like 30 minutes i started to get confused...i wasnt completely dissapointed though...it was an alright movie, its just so different than the other F13's...I wasnt expecting something like this...but the main question i thought about was ""why did the doctor eat jasons heart""?...I mean, thats just plain dumb n stupid n such...i didnt like the idea of them putting jason into other bodies..it was dumb..I could have made a WHOLE lot better F13 movie than that...Its like i said...This movie is not all THAT bad (its pretty bad though)...i wouldnt recommend renting it..",2
"This movie is a nonsensical barage of noise and gross-out ugliness. Why they bother to pretend that this is the same ""Jason"" as in the original Friday, I don't know. I guess they think the audience is pretty dumb. By 1993, it was apparent that 'they don't make 'em like they used to.' The 80s horror flicks were so much better, less loud, less obnoxious, and more fun. This is trash.",2
"Though I like th Friday The 13th series, this one STINKS!!!!!Jason is a little worm transfering from body to body. Jason is only in the beginning and the end. Though it stinks, A Nightmare On Elm Street's Freddy Krueger makes a special appearence at the end by sticking his right hand, ( The one with the claws ) out of the ground and pulls Jason's hockey mask to Hell with him. So, only if you are a die hard fan you should , if not, don't see it. You are wasting your money.",2
"Please understand that this is NOT the orange Michael W. Smith Worship CD translated directly onto a DVD. This DVD is a compilation of the Worship and Worship Again CDs. Make sure you research the songs contained in this DVD, so you will not be disappointed, as I was.",2
"This DVD is disappointing to say the least. From the moment Michael enters the arena through the crowd I feel like I'm watching carefully scripted theatre rather than worship to the King of Kings. The focus here is Michael W. Smith, ""Worship Artist"". Michael appears stiff and very conscious of the cameras, his movements choreographed. The direction is average, lacking inspiration and repetitive. The only moment I felt my spirit engage was during Awesome God. If you want a truly amazing worship experience on DVD I suggest you avoid this. You're better off buying Hillsong's ""Blessed"" or Christian City Church, Oxford Falls' new album ""Lift"".",2
I ordered the widescreen for my wife's birthday and received the full screen. The movie is good but I'm not happy about the error.,2
"If neither Sandra Bullock nor Hugh Grant (to a lesser extent) can save the thinnest and most damningly simple movie, then it's safe to say that it is indeed junked. Unlike one of the other Mark Lawrence movies featuring Bullock, 'Miss Congeniality,' Bullock doesn't get much of a chance to show off her screwball splendor. Instead, what we get from both leads is a tired effort at replaying what movie audiences love most about them, which is one joke too many and one too lame already. But, if all else fails in a screwball romance, you can at least be assured of eye candy with this pair.",2
"I gave it two stars and i was being kind. Simply because I saw ""the ring"" and gave it one star and did enjoy it more than that. But this movie is so predictable. Maybe its because I've seen this before. yes it was in ""you've got mail."" Two rich and professional people who in the begining dispise each other while one of them is in a relationship with another. About half way through the protagonist who's in the relationship miraculously drops the 'lover-we-never-see' and realizes how much she loves our other main character. But they save it all for the end with the big ""oh i've always felt this way kiss""Sadly predicatable and loaded with a lot of dry humor, this movie wasn't at all what I expected, it was worse. Sadly, Sandra's 'girl next door good looks' and Hugh's quick oneliners weren't enough to rescue this movie from its date with ...[removed store name].",2
"Sandra Bullock tries the old, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" routine for this movie. This movie was not funny at all. Even with comedian, Robert Klein in a supporting role, it doesn't take off. Hugh Grant is wasted in his role. Overall, this is a dud.",2
"TWO WEEKS NOTICE was a cute film but missed the mark unlike its predecessor Maid In Manhattan which was more real and entertaining. Sandra Bullock (Miss Congeniality, Force Of Nature) produced this film as well as stars in it. Her performance although I am sure is honest seemed a little held back playing the Harvard Lawyer fighting for the down-and-under trod.While the other side of the coin, there is the rich millionaire played by Hugh Grant (Nine Months, Notting Hill) was a more outgoing, non-caring and flamboyant wisp that almost didn't match to well with Sandra.It ran a little slow and seemed much more predictable toward the end. Written and directed by Marc Lawrence (Miss Congeniality, Force Of Nature) the movie seemed very slow in pace. Robert Klein (Primary Colors, One Fine Day) gives a standout performance as Sandra's father that is worth noting.This is a good movie for the video and DVD - but theatrically it was a little disappointing. (12-31-02)",2
"Being a fan of both Miss. Sandra Bullock and Mr. Hugh Grant I looked forward to what I felt would be a fun movie, unfortunately I was to be quite disappointed.Miss Bullock's character lacked the manic energy she has frequently displayed and that this story badly needed. Her character, Lucy Kelson, had a great deal of potential, which a lackluster performance did not deliver.Mr. Grant's performance was better, but not markedly so. The `one liners' he delivered had little punch and even less humor. The chemistry between the two main characters, necessary in this type film, just didn't seem to be there.The one bright spot was Miss. Alicia Witt, as June Carter, a sort of rival to Miss Bullock's character for the affections of Mr. Grant. Her performance had energy, humor, the vulnerability of youth and at the same time the sense that she was potentially a predator manipulating the situation for personal gain.Bottom line: Even the best miss on occasion and this is one such occasion.",2
"""Two Weeks Notice"" stars two appealing people, but they have no chemistry. My dog and cat have more chemistry. Why would a lawyer (Sandra Bullock) want to work for a conceited billionaire (Hugh Grant)? Greed is a bad thing. Falling in love after countless annoying incidents just makes this movie another routine POS. There was one scene where they were playing mixed doubles in tennis and I was truly ashamed with their athleticism. I could've probably beat all of them with my hand tied behind my back because I'm the king of handicap matches. Oh well. This movie really doesn't grab your attention and makes you wish you spent your money on something with substance, like a twinkie.",2
"Let's be honest this is as [weak] a comedy as you can imagine but having said that, Hugh Grant is funny, even with this script and Sandra Bullock is cute. I would never recommend you actually buy this but a rental on an evening when you IQ are asleep and there is nothing else on, then it is okay.",2
but I don't like Sandra doing her insane bouncing ball impersonation. seen her doing it in several movies and it really gets on my nerve.,2
"Love the movie, but beware of this DVD. 3 times I've ordered it from Amazon (twice in a Slipcase and once in a Keepcase, and all 3 DVD's skipped, the video broke up, scenes kept repeating, etc... And yes, I used the Memorex CD cleaner on the DVD player without any change, and no, none of my numerous other commercially purchased DVD's demonstrate this problem. Two Weeks Notice is the ONLY one. So my suggestion is to stick to the VCR version.",2
"OK, this review is going to be fairly short. I have to say that this movie could have been great, but unfortunately falls flat at the end. The first half of this movie is great, Hugh Grant is hilarious and Sandra Bullock manages to be cute and intelligent at the same time, and these characters are completely believable. Grant has a line where he says ""My life is a lot like Monopoly"" ( which had me rolling ) and sadly the movie is a lot like Monopoly, in that it is a 'board' game and I found myself very 'bored' in the last half of the movie.This movie is hilarious enough in the first half that I watch just that part then turn it off, because I know what is coming. The last act has them coming together and confessing their love for each other, and at that point it feels completely rushed and unbelievable, like this is the end, so they love each other, ummm, roll credits. I recommend the first half highly, then just skip the rest.",2
"Sometimes a bubblegum movie is old bubblegum, tired and chewy and not very sweet. This movie has all the pieces but doesn't have any zing to it, any purpose. They go back and forth a little bit but they never truly convinced me that they were in love or their love was in danger. Alicia Witt, a superb actress didn't really have much to do in thsi film and Hugh Grant's bumbling charm boy routine is wearing thin.I'm not sure about Bullock, she's filling a niche I'm sure. Doing films that appeal to her, that she gets paid a lot for, that help employ a lot of people. But I'm not qute sure if she's developing further along as an actress, if she's willing to take a risk and do something edgey or different or challenging. She just seems to be the best at the romantic comedy pairings movie of the season. Hopefully she'll start getting better choices.",2
"Fresh of watching ""About A Boy"" I felt like Hugh Grant could do no wrong, so despite less than stellar reviews I decided give ""Two Weeks Notice"" a shot, which was a mistake. While there are some comedic moments, this a romantic comedy and Bullock and Grant have NO chemistry. In most of the scenes they seem only mildly aware of eachother mostly focusing on thier actions. As a result, I never felt like they should be together. Further, the plot seems to jump around. Right after getting hired, the plot leapfrogs to weeks later where Grant and Bullock are now supposed to be chumy, but I never felt it. THey seem to be tired of eachother and their action forced by the plot's simple-minded purpose. After his great romantic comedies of the 1990s, this a huge step down for Grant and even for Bullock, who mostly makes bad movies anyway. This is not worth your time because it clearly wasn't even worth the actors full attention.",2
"Hugh Grant does his enjoyable act to perfection in this movie but it is so lacking in story that it's rendered mind-numbing syrup even by romantic comedy standards. The schlock political message they attempt is embarrasing even to liberals.And let's face it, Sandra Bullock is just not a screen beauty, cute maybe, but that nasal voice that not will carry a movie.",2
"By activating the ""Two Bleeps Notice"" function in Special Features, you can access the movie outtakes when a small pink heart appears on the screen. If you don't want to have to watch the entire movie, here are the locations of each heart. I think I found them all. These are listed by hour:minute:second. 18:32, 20:04, 23:38, 24:13, 26:38, 28:14, 33:02, 37:28, 41:36, 47:16, 57:50, 1:13:01, 1:24:29.The extras on the DVD are of the usual fare, but not outstanding. The commentary is somewhat interesting, with Sanda and Hugh bantering about. The movie itself is somewhat forgettable, but is an enjoyable little film. I agree with another reviewer who said that it's like iceberg lettuce: not really great for you, but certainly not bad for you either, and you'll forget all about it an hour after it's over.",2
"Nothing worth seeing-- Grant has made some classics in this genre (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, Bridget Jones's Diary)-- but ""Two Weeks Notice"" is not a classic. It isn't even an admirable effort. It is clear he enjoyed working with Sandra Bullock offscreen, but they share little onscreen chemistry. Bullock continues her title as the ""poor man's Julia Roberts"" -- it's not a harmful film-- it's just not very good.",2
Same story we've seen many times before. You know whats going to happen just by seeing the preview. Grant is great and charming. Bullock is her same old clumsy character. Supporting cast provides laughs as well. All right if you have nothing better to see.,2
"I've always been a big fan of Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock and I was really looking forward to seeing the two of them together. I sincerely wanted to enjoy myself, but the one thing you heard ALL the critics agree upon about this film turned out to be absolutely true-- It's about as ordinary and unoriginal as a romantic comedy can be. The conflicting question among all the critics was this: Were Bullock and Grant able to turn a rather dull movie into something good? I didn't think so unfortunately. Heck, I don't even think the pairing of Superman and Wonder Woman could have saved this film. It certainly doesn't compare well to Grants previous picture, ABOUT A BOY.My recommendation is not to waste your money on this movie unless you're a fan of these two actors... My final review is two and a half stars... Just too average and not many laughs.",2
"Sandra Bulluck (who is my favorite actress, by the way) never looked good in this movie and the chemistry between her and Hugh Grant was missing. Neither her character nor Hugh's was particularly like-able and the ending was, of course, predictable, but lacking in real emotion. Wait for cable.",2
"This water dispenser works just fine and my dogs have no problem drinking from it. I have a problem with cleaning it, however. I keep it outside and in the summer months, it will develop a green mold or algae inside the jug and also in the bowl. Since there is only the small narrow spout for an opening, there is no way to get any kind of brush in there to clean it. I ended up having to soak it in bleach water to remove the green stuff inside.",2
"I started off using this as the primary water dish for my pets, however within a very short amount of time, I'd have to dump out all the water to clean it because a nasty, clear slime would start growing in the dish-YUCK!I decided to start using a pet water fountain as their primary water source, because it's constantly moving and there's a filter, it stays clean a bit longer.However, this is great for cats, if you're away on vacation. But, because of the slime factor, I don't like to use this unless I have to.",2
"This waterer is a great concept, but does have some drawbacks. For starters, one of my dogs is scared to death of it and wont come near it because when the water level in the bowl gets low it gurgles just like a water cooler at work. The first time it happened she was drinking out of it and it freaked her out and now wont go near it. The other dog is just fine with it, but then again he's deaf, so the gurgle doesn't bother him. lol. The other issue i had with this is just like all water bowls, it gets dirty. so you still have to clean it as often as you would any other water bowl, but it's a bit more cumbersome having to take the big jug off, clean the bowl and but the jug back on. So, if your dog isn't afraid of the noise it makes and you don't mind the extra hassle cleaning it, it's great. Otherwise, just get a large bowl; that's what i ended up having to do.",2
"While it functions great as a pet waterer, the Microban does not work very well. We have to clean it every time we fill it (used with dogs). It is only a few months old and will get green over several days. We contacted the company and got virtually no support--just a note that we may need to clean it occasionally. No kidding. That's what we told them. So good waterer, terrible customer support, and does not stay clean very well.",2
"As others have noted, this system works exceedingly well up until the time that the bottle develops a crack -- & make no mistake, the plastic used for the bottle is so brittle that it will eventually crack if it is even slightly mishandled. The ""antibacterial"" aspect could be better as well. I have had some success in using RTV to seal cracks, but eventually you're going to have to replace the unit.",2

"I bought the LeBistro Portion Control Feeder and for the first 12 feeding times at breakfast and lunch it worked like a champ. Then it stopped delivering meals. Fortunately I was aware of it - I bought it for when we went away for weekends, but wanted to be sure the cat wouldn't starve while we were gone so set it up to feed. The Waterer I bought is fine. It's just a little water cooler. I wish it were a little more solid though.Back to the Feeder - I had to reset the whole thing twice before it worked. I had the right times and portions but just didn't drop the food. I'm going to give it another week or so before I ask to have it replaced.When it works it's great - good design for the cost. Pretty easy to set up.But intermittent behavior defeats the purpose of being able to leave with confidence.",2
"I used this waterer for several months. I had always rinsed it out with fresh water before refilling it, and scrubbed the bottom part. Within 2 days, the bottom part would always start growing an orange slime on it, and I smelled the plastic water-holder part, and it smells like algae (although none is visible). I feel awful for using this product for my cat, and have switched to a regular bowl that I can thoroughly clean daily. I am only keeping the automatic water dish in the event I'm away a day or two. Other than that, DO NOT USE FOR DAILY WATER.",2
"My new cat 4 mo. old could see bottom of spout-nipple-water exit point and kept reaching in to pull on it,leading too a huge mess as it then pawed at the water in the bowl as i guess it was it the way.digging might better explain as it threw the water out of the tray/pan onto the floor as fast as it could (yes it is now funny).Only saying so because last one only had a small hole for water to come out of into pool/drinking area.Only needed a new bottle but was just as cheap to get new assembly.re-inventing the wheel in this case did not work with my cat who has now become bored with it and finally just drinks out of it.hope this helps.",2
"This album was originally released in 1968, when Regis was Joey Bishop's sidekick. It was Regis's only commercially released album, although he later recorded some albums that he released on his own. Regis had an okay singing voice, but it was certainly nothing special. Also, his style was hopelessly outdated by 1968. The arrangements of these standards are incredibly corny, too. But a few of these songs are good for a laugh. The highlight of the album is the end of ""Toot, Toot, Tootsie/Baby Face"", where Regis yells out ""Sock it to, 'em, Tootsie!"". Now, that's (unintentional) comedy!",2
As much as I love the show - I find the price of this DVD collection to be insane!,2
I wasn't able to give the actual box for the dvd as part of the gift because the top was ripped off. The status was that it was just like new. This is not just like new if the box is broken. Otherwise the dvds look great and not scratched.,2
"so far, still watching the first season. But can tell you that by only watching the first show i would give the season a 2. the first show of any season should grab your attention, and they do that but they just dont do a very good job at keeping it. In the first show, theres death, closet ""hook ups"", gay soft core love scenes and just plain drama, wonder what the rest of the shows are going to be like. If you are into the slow paced ironic drama then this show is for you.",2
"This isn't as much a review as much a question. Are they releasing Season 1 again next month but not on BluRay, why???",2
"Based on the other reviews, I am in the minority. This series just didn't do anything for me. I never got into the characters or even felt like i couldn't wait for the next episode. I don't know what it was, it was just boring. I never watched past the first season so i don't know if it got better or what but there is just better shows out there.",2
"This book gives good coverage of Oracle's JDBC implementation. That is about as far as it goes. This is just too close to being documentation. When purchasing books on a specific technology, I am looking for the author's insight. Specific things the author learned while working with it. Give me best practices, suggestions, things to avoid, etc. Tell me what I won't learn from Oracle's docs, don't just rewrite them.",2
"A look at the DVD cover conveys a message to the red blooded male that when seeing this movie you will be seeing some skin. If that's all you're looking for then you'll give it a higher rating than I have. I found disappointment as the story had potential but hindered itself by taking avenues from reality to far fetched situations without needing to. There is some suspense, and enough skin to keep it away from the kids, but overall it missed it's potential.",2
"Aside from anything else that is good or bad, routine or entertaining about this film, I can't be the only one who was completely unable to get past the fact that, in the big murder scene, both the hero and the victim act more stupefyingly idiotic than any characters in the lowest-grade teen slasher ever made.",2
"Because I KNOW you didn't see any amazing acting, incredible plot twists or X-rated sex scenes in Body Double. This film is watchable if nothing else is on; I'll give it that. But ""gripping?"" ""DePalma's masterpiece?"" ""a classic?"" Only if you took a LOT of drugs before you saw it. It's typical DePalma; in other words, a Hitchcock ripoff he manages to make a few notches above putrid.",2
There's much better Heep Compilations ('Running all night with the lion'... Please!!!) Don't waste your money.,2
This is a good classic rock cd with the exception that stealin one of their best songs is not on this or their greatest hits. The best song on here is Easy Livin so this is a cd only for a die hard Uriah Heep fan.,2
"With the exception of the catchy ""Easy Livin'"" I found this to be an unmemorable compilation of rock songs.",2
"The author is obviously a highly skilled pilot and has extensive experience. His recounting of the progress in the airline industry is very interesting. I bought the book expecting to read about progress in dealing with the problems encountered in adapting new technology and adjusting to the obviously over crowded skies. While the author states (over and over) that both are very real problems, he does not offer much in terms of what is being done to address the pilot's ever expanding workload. He seems merely intent on convincing the reader that the industry and the FAA are out to get the pilot. This book is not so much a study of human factors as a pilot's complaints about an industry that probably somehow just became something he no longer cared to be a part of.",2
"I'll echo some of the other reviews on here: the navigation is ridiculous, as is the ""easter egg"" hunt. With most DVD players ability to directly access any tracks, easter eggs aren't cool anymore. And one of my favorite videos ""A View To A Kill"" got the opening Bond gunbarrel and the beginning of the song chopped off (I'll assume it's due to licensing issues). FYI, it's not much better on the AVTAK movie DVD either: there, the video is unedited but it's cropped at the black bars so the floating cameras get cropped as well, plus it's worse quality than the Greatest version.For a band that single-handedly revolutionized the music video world and put MTV on the map, this is a shameful and appalling DVD. Hopefully there will be definitive DVD in the future that will include My Own Way, Careless Memories, and all the other ones that got left out, not to mention proper remastering and a better interface and package design. Hope springs eternal.",2

HDD Enclosures are always confusing as there are so many available in the market with so different ways of connecting peripheral/auxiliary devices. I went through a large list of HDD Enclosures and after couple of days purchased this item - waited for couple of days only to find out that this enclosure does not fit my internal hard disk. The board had some soldering blemishes but never had a chance to test the connectivity. The build looks pretty ok and it was a great ide to include the screw driver as part of the package - It was really helpful. Be sure of what Hard disks you are using - SATA is common these days. I ended up buying a SATA to USB cable that served the purpose of transferring data from my old hard disk to a newer one. This product may be good for the price advertised but ensure that this one serves the purpose. This would fit only HDD of laptops cos its 2.5inch and would not work with the bigger solid state drives - the ones which are normally used for desktop,3
"The device works, but you have to be careful with it. The IDE connection is not very deep and doesn't seem to be reliable. On the top of that, IDE connection is the only thing that hold the drive inside the case. While I am moving around with enclosure, I can hear the hard drive rattling inside.The Enclosure is OK for the stationary setup, but would not work for any mobile tasks.",3
This product is not for you if your going to use this as you primary portable hard dive. The only use for this enclosure is to retrieve data from another HDD.The solder joints are weak and look like their about to break.This product is not going to last very long so get a this is not for you if your going use it long term.,3
"Apparently, not all 2.5"" laptop drives are the same, or perhaps what i have isn't exactly a 2.5"" drive (IBM Travelstar, DCXA-210000, out of an old Dell laptop(?)). It didn't fit in the aluminum case... real close, but no cigar. Maybe if this drive had ever so slightly rounded edges along it's length it would fit.Fortunately, this is acceptable for my needs. It electronically edge-connected to my drive & provides the USB2.0 interface, but i do have to leave the drive out of the case, naked / exposed. O-well. 'Works.Karl*----->",3
"First things first, this enclosure is not blue, as listed. It is silver, and looks very similar to my other enclosure, which causes me some confusion, and is why I bought (or attempted to) a blue one.Otherwise, it works fairly well. Can get a little hot since it lacks fans, but keep it off of any insulating surface and it's fine.",3
"it took me a few extra minutes to plug in my drive and the usb cable came with the drive didn't work at first, but I figure out that problem and now it works great. Quiet, fast and slim.The vendor sent me a replacement usb cable no extra charge.Thx.",3
"As an enclosure, it seems to work fine. I knew it was cheap; we'll see how it fares over a period of time.My only quibble is the cable. I don't mind the Y-cable for use with computers that need the extra connection for power. It's the fact that the cable is a nonstandard USB A-A. Almost every other USB drive is A-B or A-mini B. Why does this matter? Because if you lose the cable, it'll be a hassle to replace it. As a consultant I have a lot of external drives, and don't want to worry about keeping specific cables with specific drives.",3
"Well, i have had it for a while and it was working. But then my computer suddenly stopped realizing it was even plugged in. So i tried another computer, and then my laptop, but nothing. I think it may be the driver, but I am just warning you people that you need to be careful.",3
"This drive works as advertised, my issue comes from the fact that the connector on the drive is a USB A connector. This makes things a little tough if you lose the cable - because it isn't easily replaced with either a mini or micro USB end, or the standard USB B connector. I doubt I'll get another one - though once connected it did work as expected.",3
"Like the title says, it does what it needs to and nothing more. I had to et one of these to do a data recovery from my brothers laptop.The case itself is well designed accept for the back plastic cover. It will take some jimmying to get it back on once the harddrive is installed in it. BUT YOU CAN DO IT.Also, don't loose the original usb cable. Its not proprietary but its a cross-over USB.Performs as expected and costs almost nothing compared to the alternatives I've seen in the past",3
"Works fine with Windows XP but unfortunately I bought this to access data on my old drive from a computer using Windows 7. Windows 7 says the drive is invalid and only give me an option to format it. Odd too since the data on the drive was all created in Windows 7. I have not yet tried that because I wanted to pull some data off of it first. I had to connect it to my work computer that uses Windows XP and share over the network to pull data.On a side note: this comes with a USB cord that has three plugs and no instructions at all on which one goes to enclosure, which one is supposed to plug in or if it even matters. One of the plugs is longer and thicker my guess is that one is for USB ports that are further away from where you want to put the drive but then I don't know since there are NO INSTRUCTIONS.",3
It has teenie-tiny phillips screws to hold in the top. Had to stuff some folded paper down inside because the case is longer than my HD and it kept sliding back and forth. The did supply a little phillips driver for those screws but the head of the supplied driver was way too big for the screws. What a joke. It worked once mounted and modified but it should have some foam or something to account for different length HDs and some click-in type of mounting instead of screws like those that are in your glasses. These screws are going to get lost and screw into plastic directly so eventually will strip out its socket. It does have a nice slip-in case and sleek color.,3
"This product was easy to set up and install. With a DVD it has pretty good surround sound and appears to be well balanced. The wireless rear speakers work well. One feature which was suprisingly missing, however, was the ability to connect the sound from your digital cable box by means of a fiberoptical connection so that you would get true dolby when the show is broadcast in dolby 5.1.",3
"This book provides examples of how to do certain special effects.It was definitely more of a ""tips and tricks"" book than it was a learning resource. Just follow the steps, and go ""WOW"" just like the title.It doesn't really explain in detail how the trick was done and why you're doing a certain step. Most photoshop gurus will just scoff at this book, and most newbies will walk away amazed, but no smarter about photoshop than before they read it.The latter portions of the book was nothing more than a summary of the different photoshop filters found in commercial filter packages. I question why thoese filters were even in the book; it seemed like advertising that does not benefit the readers.",3
"I absolutely loved the anime of Cowboy Bebop. This book is set in the same universe with the same characters. Their stories, however, have changed. The way we meet Ed, Faye, Ein, and the history of Spike and Jet are different based on the author's take on the characters. Some might not like this, but I like the new twist on their relationships. Plus the author has added a whole new badguy! Since the TV series is over, it is also like getting all new Bebop stories. I haven't read the rest in this manga series so I don't know how they continue, but if you are dying for more Spike and don't mind the alternate reality, I highly recommend the book!If you don't want the stories to change, consider picking up the Cowboy Bebop series by Hajime Yadate and Yutaka Nanten, ISBN#1931514917, simply called Cowboy Bebop Book 1 etc. These are more like continuing adventures that take place in between what would have been a TV episode.",3

"i like RBL and Black-C a lot. Taydatay is my favorite from 11/5. So this combo made me expect a lot. Production is not as great as I would have thought, but there are some cuts (at least a few from black c) that dont sound too rapmaster keyboard-drum machine style. I liked the title track w/ big mack. taydatay/big mac collabo album would be good. as i said, the lyrics overshadow the production- sean t (he did this title track), ric roc (its hard 2 b-legit) have the best in the bay right now..",3
"I have to say..I just started using this series and thus far, the written portion is great! But how could I have known it required a very expensive CD? I sure wish that part had been stated before I ordered this series.",3
"Offutt's strength is his prose and characterization, but his narrative is a little off here. A shame really, because his first memoir was solid all around. He himself admits to not knowing what the Holocaust story has to do with his own return to Kentucky and, quite frankly, neither do I. It seemed thrown in as maudlin filler and was blatantly incongruous.The ending seemed rushed too. ""I am saying good-bye"" and ""I want to stay. I am ready to leave."" I know he can do better and the rest of the book proves that he can do better.Still though, there are some stylistic gems here. Offutt uses words and characters wonderfully. You'll love them and understand them. He's a very solid writer and students learning to write creatively can learn a lot from his craft--overtly and subtly.Worth a read.",3
"Three stars may be generous for the game. There is really only one way to consistently score: take the ball right to the hoop while using the ""juke"" moves. Short range jump shots don't work. Post-up game: forget it. Anything resembling a real basketball game: forget it. But if you do take the ball to the hoop and use the juke moves and you have one of the star players it is unstoppable. Play LeBron: he'llo score every time. If you like a pure arcade-style game then you might like this one.",3

If your not a cyclist you might not find this book is for you.",3

"Among Arnold's early movies, this one stands out for the eclectic supporting cast. His early movies were remarkedly free of any acting on his part; I suspect he was still learning English then. But one way to make him look better is to hire nonactors, or miscast semiactors. Enter Wilt and Grace. (Later, Richard Dawson). This is as much a collectible as Terminator 2.",3
"""Conan the Destroyer "", this disappointing sequel to the entertaining and well made ""Conan the Barbarian"" is an example of what happens when studios attempt to broaden the appeal of a movie for younger audiences. This movie tries to inject more slapstick humor and includes ""big name"" stars (Grace Jones and Wilt Chamberlain), while sacrificing much of the story line, effective characters, and raw action that made the first movie so watchable. The special effects were also weaker and often seemed out of place, making this a real step backwards.If it wasn't for ""Arni"", it wouldn't be worth the price of the DVD. Recommended only for die hard Conan and ""Arni"" fans.",3
"After the succesful Conan The Barbarian the inevitable sequel took part 2 years after the first.This time Conan the Cimmerian(Schwarzenegger) must find with the help of a virgin princess a jewel that leads to the horn of a god Dagoth which a evil queen(Douglas) needs to give to their kingdom all the power of the world.Followed by the sorcerer of the first film(Mako) by a cure thief(Lester) and a agile warrior(Jones) they must face all the dangers of such a risky mission.With dign special and visual effects and the final monster made by the creator of ET the film has a whole dign production better than italian imitations(Ator) or cheesy and camp productions(Red Sonja,Barbarian Queen) and at least is entertaining and pleased to watch.",3

"Had eagerly awaited this one. Great movie, but the image quality was in no way up to BluRay standards. Not having seen it in the theater, I don't know whether this was by design.That said... Oscar-worthy.",3
"Everybody knows the movie is fantastic, and I'm sure the transfer to blu-ray is equally as impressive, but I received this product with a giant puncture mark through the case. There was no damage to the box, so I assume it had to be due to how the movie was handled in the warehouse. It literally looks like somebody attacked it with a screwdriver. Luckily it didn't damage the disks, but regardless it's still annoying.",3
I absolutely love this movie. I hate paying $25 for blu ray discs though as even with my top notch equipment it's just not that much better. I already have two versions of the dvd.. yeah i like it that much and wanted the blu ray basically cause the price was right. However i was disappointed as when i got it there was a golf ball type divet in the blu ray which wouldn't allow it to play. I unfortunately had to return it. I am giving this item a 3 star for midway though because i received fast service and it was extremely easy to return at no cost to me.So yes quality control sucked that this got out as it clearly couldn't play for anyone but Amazon customer service support was top notch for returns.,3
"I wasnt planning on watching this movie but decided to last minute. I saw it on the huge screen at IMAX.. special effects and action was great.. heath ledger was fantastic in the role as the Joker.. i had only seen him in romance and drama roles before this, but he really suprised me with this one. He really went out leaving his mark.If you're not a fan of his, or of the Batman series, you might not become a fan from watching this movie, but i do recommend giving it a chance at least. Its a pretty good storyline and even a bit scary towards the end.. i only bought the dvd for a friend, but i wouldnt mind watching it again.Definately watch it if you're a Heath Ledger fan though.. he was awesome in his role and you will love him in this one.",3
"This was a solid movie, but way too long. It was as if they kept putting in another scheme for the Joker to pull off...then another...then another. Why? They could have cut 30 minutes from the movie easily.I have to say that I was expecting much more from Heath. While his performance was certainly solid, it was by no means the oscar winning portrayal I was hoping to see. And for him to have said that the role was so disturbing that it was causing insomnia and a lot of his problems--he clearly had some emotional issues then, because the Joker was actually a lot more tame that I thought he was going to be. All in all a solid movie, but it was too long and over-hyped.",3
When i hit the play button i watched so horrible video quality for a release that this one..i felt ripped off.The Sound- The sound is very clear and crispy. No hiss sound or cracking sound.Extras- well another let down here.,3
"My star rating is for the BluRay, not the film itself.As much as I love this movie (and I do love this movie), I had to settle for the standard DVD version because of the sudden aspect ratio changes for the IMAX footage. I found this amazingly distracting and it constantly kept throwing me out of the movie. Hopefully someday they'll release another BluRay version that has the option to disable the IMAX ratio switch and I'll be able to upgrade, but until then I must make do with 480p when I watch this wonderful film. It's a shame, too, because other than the annoying ratio swapping the film looks amazing on BD.",3
that must have been the studios motto when they made the standard dvd. This has to be the worst transfer I have seen in modern film making. I am absolutely perplexed why this film was not made in DTS except as others have pointed out that perhaps they are trying to push Blu Ray.Its a great film ( I saw it three times in IMAX) but this dvd is a disappointment. We deserved better.,3
"Everyone knows about the movies that are very well written, casted, and directed. They are awarded and phrased films we've placed on our movie shelves for good looks and not show (There Will Be Blood, No Country For Old Men, Atonement, Titanic, Broke back Mountain, Batman Returns, may i continue...) . I have added The Dark Knight to the movie I must own, because it was great (and Heath Ledger died before it's release and has made it history), but i will never suffer through the three hours of talk talk talk and batman's boring humiliation AGAIN!!! EVER!",3
"Batman tries to destroy organized crime in Gotham. The Joker is the adversary here in this sequel to Batman Begins. It was one of the top two highest grossing films ever along with Spider Man 3. Comic fan or not, Batman has his origins in the 1930s with Detective Comics, hence the DC company. Nightwing was the original Robin. The secind Robin was killed by The Joker in A Death in the Family. In the Knightfall, Knightquest and Knightsend series in the 90s, Batman is crippled by a new villain named Bane. His latest protege Azrael dones an upgraded costume in his sit in as Batman. In Zero Hour Nightwing regrets Batman didn't take him as the fill in. They brought in Batgirl in like 1989.",3
"I really enjoyed Batman Begins and looked forward to this movie, but I was disappointed. The story line is great, the acting superb, but it is extremely dark and violent. I think it could all have been done as effectively without all the gratuitous ugliness. The depiction of the prosecutor after his burns was not believable and better suited to a horror movie. A very good concept taken too far.",3
"The acting was great!!! The movie, though, was very dark. I like a little more light!! Heath Ledger will be missed!!!!!!",3
"Apart from the mask, there isn't that much special about this limited edition. No audio commentary is my big complaint. However, the Batman Unmasked featurette is an unexpected pleasure, as it psychoanalyzes Batman in all his incarnations. I suspect there's another limited edition coming with more bells and whistles. Me, I bought this because I loved the movie and this set cost as much as the regular two-DVD edition.",3
"I wil not get into a review of the film itself, other than to say its an outstanding movie...far transending the genre into a truly imaginative frightening film. The DVD on the other hand is insultingly bad. Poor resolution...artifacts...edge enhancement....lots of compression...poor black levels...etc. Its dvds like this that make some believe that studios, especially Warrner Brothers are intentionaly degrading the potental quality on standard DVD to help push Blu Ray. Until this dvd I thought that was some paranoid delusion on the part of some film fans, but this DVD is so shoddy ...especially for such a film, that I can almost believe that they may be on to something. Shame on Warner Brothers for this truly sub standard DVD. I am a television producer, so I know what a DVD can and should look like...and this is NOT it!!!",3
"Yes, Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is an excellent film without question. BUT, shame on Warner Bros. for releasing such a not-so-special 2disk special edition for it's initial release onto DVD. NO INTERVIEWS WITH HEATH LEDGER? Or most of the cast and crew for that matter. Instead you get a scant pathetic 2 ""making off"" tiny featurettes, 6 lame episodes of ""Gotham Tonight"" the seperated IMAX scenes, and some yawn trailers and photo galleries. They're obviously saving the real good stuff for next year's release after Ledger's won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his amazing portrayal of the Joker.So yes, the film rocks, this release sucks though, so Please...be Patient.",3
"This movie simply had too many holes in the plot and was far too drawn out to earn the title of best movie in the current Batman series. Batman Begins was a much more compelling, well written, and far better film in my opinion.",3
"The Bottom Line:The Dark Knight, despite being one of the best reviewed films of 2009, does not measure up to the accolades bestowed upon it or to its prequel Batman Begins; it's poorly-plotted (the ending *actually* hinges on a magical technology that allows Batman to see what everyone in the city is doing), severely overlong at 150 minutes, inconsistent with its characters (Harvey Dent is supposed to be enraged at the death of his fiancÃ©e, yet he teams up with her murderer) and just not the gem that it is made out to be.2.5/4",3
"I'm so disapointed in this movie.I'm glad I waited for ""The Dark Knight""to come on HBO instead of paying for the DVD.Heath Ledger is great,He really is the Joker,but TOO much Tongue.A couple of times is alright,but every scene !Christian Bale is horrible.He sounds like Puddy on Seinfield.I can't believe he was cast to play Batman.""The Dark Knight""is not a film I want to watch again.",3
"There's lots of action in ""The Dark Knight"". The Joker (Heath Ledger) stole the show. He played the character perfectly! Blu-ray quality is outstanding, and the audio is awesome. I didn't like the fact that the scenes switched from the Imax view to the widescreen with black bars. This took away from the movie in my opinion. Good special features. Buy the DVD for Heath Ledger's acting and the good blu-ray video and audio. The movie is over-rated.",3
"The Dark Knight starring Christian Bale is pretty exciting but the hype doesn't live up to my chargin. Heath Ledger is absolutely brilliant as The Joker, he is muchly missed but he's not the one who steals this movie, Aaron Eckhart is a pleasant surprise! I'm glad Katie Holmes didn't reprise her role as Rachel, Maggie Gyllenhaal is such a better actress by far. The opening scene is probably the best sequence, the ending is a bit of a letdown. Entertaining action flick but has its flaws.",3
"Don't get me wrong on the 3 star rating, I love this movie. The reason I knocked it down is because the special edition version is a total waste of money. I could never have imagined such a total lack of effort for such a major movie as this when it comes to special features. Hell, there isn't even a director's commentary on the single disk version, so what do you think you're getting on the second disk. Yes, the two little documentaries are interesting, but are not worth the extra money. I am extremely disappointed in whoever put this thing together, my copy of Dr. Strangelove from the 1960s has more special features than this, what were they thinking.",3
"At one point in the movie, nearing the end, I was saying to myself, ""My God! How much longer can this go on! What more can they do!""As a showcase for special effects and especially Heath Ledger's amazing performance, this movie is a success.More from Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman would have been nice, as would more of a story.It's almost like they took an hour of the Joker's life and bisected it into seconds. Senseless violence, on and on...",3
"I saw the Dark Knight without seeing Batman Begins simply because I was curious and I needed something. I was blown out of my movie-seeing brain! At the urge of the man (who wasn't present when Dark Knight came out) we saw Dark Knight Rises. It was NOT THAT GREAT. If I had to tell someone to only see one, I'd say see Dark Knight because it is non-stop suspense and intensity with so many twists and unpredictable spins you're still thinking about it. The Dark Knight Rises is predictable, looooooooong, and leaves so many open ends Christopher Nolan is lying through his 5 layers of fat that this ""trilogy"" is over. You cannot end this on a weak note. See Dark Knight. If you choose to be fulfilled, see Batman Begins, Dark Knight Rises (not cuz it's better, cuz you need the history), then Dark Knight. Don't save this til last, but save the 3 hrs if you plan on it. It's really not the best",3
I barely remember watching this. Weak story and weak performances. In the comics Batman and Bruce Wayne were big hulking guys. That helped with my suspension of disbelief. Making these guys heart throbby is obviously the idea of Hollywood suits. It sometimes works in favor of their bottom line but not this time.,3
Made poorly out of flexible plastic. overpriced. Wish it was of better quality.Movie rocks though!,3
"I saw this film on an airplane on my laptop because it had been sitting on the hard drive. The graphics were very good, the acting was decent, the action was unbelievable and the rubble used was of both high in quality and quantity. This is the ideal films for people who love blockbusters, super hero films and strong villains. I don't think there is anything different here in terms of the story line.Christian Bale acted well, the late Heath Ledger was good too but overall the film doesn't have enough grey to intrigue one beyond the 153 minutes it runs for. I'm not into superhero films and think this is about as good as they get. To me, Nolan's masterpiece was The Prestige.",3
I liked Batman begins much better then this movie. I thought Dark Night was way too dark of a movie. I wasn't expecting that from what we have seen with the past Batman movie and comic books. Also all the hype on this movie was way over done. I think Heath Ledger was a great actor but this wasn't his best by far.,3
"Well, as I turned it off after about 20 minutes or so, it would appear, definitely, that it was just not my kind of movie. A movie, must really grab me in the beginning or off it goes. This one did not.",3
"Little too dark for me, a 50 y/o female, but hubby loved it. Said it was the best so far.",3
i still haven't watched it completely yet cuz i keep falling asleep but this movie is awesomeee!..from last time that i watched it before this copy of my own.eh on blue-ray since i don't get what the big fuss is about but wooo cuz this movie is great and with mucho action.,3
"I seem to be in the minority, but this just wasn't as good as I expected. I much prefer ""Batman Begins"". Over analyzing, I find myself wondering how the Joker managed to set so many charges in the hospital...when did he or his ""little helpers"" find the time and opportunity? Stuff like that just bugged me. But, most of all (and I suppose one has to be from Minnesota to appreciate this), the Joker reminded me way too much of Al Franken. Al Franken with lipstick on. Looked like him. Sounded like him. Easy to dislike, sure, but still...disconcerting.",3
My son likes this movie. I ordered it for him. The quality seemed to be good. It was a good price for the product.,3
"The Dark Knight Blu-ray well-received. The contents were completely without moreConfiguration was good. But no matter, even private sellers on Amazon U.S.Does the product were sent to Canada to say thrilled? Will be too upset.Amazon Sellers ""It makes you regret salgeol. hey, intervideo is the best teacherHope you have had this happen. I've seen the movie. Awesome picture quality andHas left a sound impression. Thank you.",3
"I finally watched this video the other night. It starts out very slow but then takes off with a 'shot'. It is a very 'dark' movie as all have said before me, but not it's too awfully dark emotionally as I had anticipated. It is shot in a dark cinema mode for affect. I liked the movie, though, I could not help thinking about the demise of Heath Ledger and was overcome with thoughts of his daughter who will never know him.His perfomance was good! Christian Bale and Gary Oldman, who have been overlooked, also gave good perfomances for this genre,but due to the controversy surrounding Mr. Ledger's death they have been overlooked, but that's just my opinion.I pray for Mr. Ledger'sfamily. I also pray that in time his last performance as an actor will not be over shadowed by his death.This is a definate See It!",3
"Wasn't sure what to expect, there has been so much hype about the film along with Heath Ledger's demise soI wondered if it would be a big disappointment, it wasn't. It was very well acted by all concerned, excellent special effects, some really DARK moments, all that have been described to death in other reviews, such as the mobile phone in the stomach, blowing people up etc along with the Joker, the amazing Heath Ledger (I liked him better in a Knight's Tale but he is pretty good in Dark Knight) running around Gotham City like maddened clown on prozac, not to mention Michael Caine as Batman's butler, and Batman himself, a troubled soul who doesn't know if he himself is good or bad?Worth going to see if you really the big cinema experience but I would have been happy to wait for it to come out on DVD, it was good but it's not in my top ten of movies.",3
"I had watched this movie in the cinemas. But, i'm afraid i prefer the previous bat man movies!Christopher Nolan has the habit of hiding action choreography with dark scenes, and quick micro view of fighting sequences which makes me wonder what when by. Honestly, I cannot savour the action scenes half the time, 'cos they are either hidden by the dark lighting or a partial micro view of the action!Sorry such direction may fool the rather imaginative audience who rely totally on their subconcious imagination for action, but not me. I am not convinced of the shortchanging action sequence. My ultimate hero movie is still the Spiderman trilogy, where you can savour clearly the action sequence that is really a mastery of action hero movies at its finest.",3
"The bat pot is made of plastic, detailed and nice but for a blu ray collector the case could be inconvenient. I would rate it more if additional to the bat case the package includes the regular blue box.",3
"Did anyone's set come with the same exact two discs inside the mask? My brother and I both received this from our mom on Christmas. I know the discs looks the same outside, but I put both in the dvd player and they have the same exact content on them. Anyone else find this? Wtf?",3
"I got a blu-ray version ""The Dark Knight""sound is good , but picture quality is not badalmost even that standard DVD I thinkThat's disappointedand this Bluray's most of the problem is mixed IMAX filmBecause , there's aspect ratio will changing in sometimeI been annoying while I watchingThis is not really movieI don't like thisWhat does Christopher Nolan thinking ?If standard DVD is not including IMAXI have to buy it again",3
"stunning picture on the blu ray release of this DVD but the aspect ratio changing throughout the entire picture is distracting and annoying.also, the most of the spoken dialogue is very difficult to hear.love the film - hate the DVD.",3
"Christian Bale returns as Batman in the sequal the Dark Knight. Once again he does not fail in bring the goods. He was a talent actor. The same goes to the late Heath Ledger in his Joker. Before the Joker was always a silly villain in previous Batman movies but in this one he is an awsome, twisted villain you can't take your eyes off. The sequal packs a lot action and twists I didn't see coming. Like Batman deciding to save the District Attorney rather then Rachel whom I assume he would. The District Attorney becomes the second villain in the movie as that act and his disfigurement transforms him from the good hearted hero to villain. You can see and understand why he falls from grace which has always been one of my favorite things to watch. The only problem the Dark Knight has though is it drags on and on. When you think its over it contiunes on and on.",3
"This movie was a disappointment. It was so hyped up by the press that I thought for sure it was going to be absolutely amazing, but it's not as good as Batman Begins, overall. The plot is weak, the dialogue is boring, and it's hard to follow. Not because the plot is intricate, but because the story is just disconnected and vague in places. Heath Ledger delivers a great performance as Joker--that's the best thing about this movie. Most of the rest is hype. Cool special effects and a lot of action, as you would expect, though.Not as bad of as sequel as the latest Indiana Jones flop, but just not as good as I was expecting....",3
"I loved Batman Begins, so I was eagerly anticipating seeing The Dark Knight! Especially given all the hype it received.After watching it on DVD, I felt very mixed about it. Heath Ledger was great, he definitely deserves all the praise he got for this role. The main characters are fine as well.The problems I had with the movie is that it's way too long, for one thing. Dent's character wasn't needed in this series yet. The editing wasn't as good as the first movie in that there were parts that made no sense and should have been cut.For instance, Gordon fakes his own death to keep his family out of harms way. Nice idea by itself. But then once he's back ""alive"" again his family gets taken by Harvey Dent anyway! So much for that plan.I started to get bored in some places. Again, it was just too long and unfocused for me. It had some great spots, but not enough for me to recommend this as anything better than a so-so movie.",3
"I was pretty excited to get this dvd considering all the hype about how great the movie is, however, I was pretty disappointed after watching it! This movie is okay but it is not the ""oscar-worthy"" movie that people like to say it is. Like I said in the title...it's just okay. The three stars are for the quality of the blu-ray, not the movie itself.",3
"Heath Ledger is marvelous in his final role, and that should be enough to go see the film or rent it in some months time. But be warned that all the hype come from a crowd that consider ""comic-book-movies"" as the epitome of cinema. The movie is all metaphor, and some action sequences. And it is not exactly subtle when it tells you about good and evil. Maybe the readers of this lines will think that the film reflects the world's despair in bleak times, but in fact those Grey days are American ones. As with all the other ""comic-book-movies"" of this decade (I didn't see the latest Del Toro yet) this film will be lost in time as were the serials of yore. Entertaining?, yes. Depressing?, you bet. A classic?, is not, so better put your coins for that goal into ""Wall-E"", clear winner of the relevancy contest.",3
"I saw the movie in Imax when it was released. I thought the movie was very good, and well worth the money and time. Dark is right.I previously stated that I could only watch this on my Mac, but now I found that my old LG unit was failing. I just hooked up a newPanasonic DMP-BD60 Blu-ray Disc Player, Blackplayer, and it did just fine.",3
"The trend of film remakes in Hollywood concerns me. This movie is considerably darker and more gritty than the first Batman movie. Dark isn't always bad, but was this film really necessary? The Joker didn't really feel like the Joker. Mind you, Heath Ledger did a good job in his role, but the role itself did not really fit. If you like Batman, stick with the original movies - Jack Nicholson did an awesome job as the Joker in the first. Definitely rent this movie before you actually decide to buy, this movie will only appeal to certain tastes. I especially did not like the Joker's backstory in this one.However, the first film in this series was much better and more coherent.",3
This is a very nice movie and Bluray disc quality is excellent.But Packing not good.Amazon didnt ship me the bluray with Hard Paper Cover.That not good.It suppose to come with that perticular cover.So dont go with the pictures shown for the disc discription.,3
"I heard so much about this series, so maybe my expectations were too high. The batman character seems so flat and, yes, I know he is a comic book character. Also, I felt the actor's choice for Batman's voice was too distracting. The visual effects and design were quite well done and enjoyable to watch, however.",3
the itunes version did not worked so I guess you are better off getting it somewhere else and get the cheaper dvdthe movie is by far the best batman ever!!!,3
"This movie is not as good as the first installment of this series. My first problem is the length of this thing- it seems to just go on and on. The second is that there really isn't any suspense, and you actually just don't care about how things come out. Most of the plot twists may be seen about an hour before they occur- they've been done so much better in other movies. And, you tire of watching what seems to be an endless series of psuedo intellectual dialoge punctuated by scenes of predictable and overdone violence. The special effects are good, but the action scenes eventually get to be ludicrous and even silly.I have to agree that Heath Ledger did an excellent job- much more than I expected, but the rest of the cast lets him down.",3
"This movie is a hit in our house. The acting is just superb. Rarely do I watch a movie and forget I'm watching a movie, but that happens here. Gary Oldman is fantastic as Commissioner Gordon, Christian Bale is the best Batman ever, and Maggie Gyllenhall is such an improvement over Katie Holmes there are no words.My only beef with this movie is the sound editing. If you have the volume at a normal level to hear the conversations between the characters, when the action starts you're pretty much blasted by the explosions; I find myself constantly having to adjust the sound while I watch, and keep the subtitles on so that if the sound is okay for the action, we can still understand what people are saying. Hopefully when the next one comes to DVD, the sound editing will be better.",3
"I don't understand what is so great about this movie. It's a good action flick, but not the best or most exciting.The opening scene was really good, but after that the movie got dull. If it weren't for Heath Ledger's performance, I would have not bothered watching at all. Everyone else, except for Eric Roberts who was pretty cool in his small part, was boring as heck.""Iron Man"" is a much better super hero movie.",3
I would have liked to view less violence in the film. Scariest Joker I've seen !Worth watching but not a family movie,3
"Not going to say that the movie wasn't any good, it was very entertaining( a little too long though ). Seriously come on people this movie is only breaking records at the box office do to the death and performance of Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger did an amazing job. He completely stole the show. Christian Bale was good when he was Bruce Wayne but when he put on the silly costume and became the Batman things got a little retarded. Like his voice for example. Another complaint that I have is everyone out there comparing this movie to Iron Man. Iron Man was also a very entertaining movie with flaws. Comparing the two is like comparing apples to oranges they are both two totally different types of films. So jump off of the high horse and realize that Heath Ledger is the main reason that The Dark Knight will smash box office records.",3
"The movie is great! but the features sucks! If you wanna buy cause of the movie go for it, but if you are a feature fun, then don't waste your $$$, we should wait till they come out with a better version and show more on how the made the movie etc.",3
this product is not what I am looking for. It did not improve my skin. I will not buy it again.,3
I bought this sleep mask 4 years ago for a school trip to South America. Was able to wear the sleep mask comfortably while traveling. I like the raised eyes and nose. As long as I wear it low it keeps all the light out. I have worn it occasionally throughout the years and it is now starting to fall apart a little bit.,3
"While I found Just Do It an interesting, well-written book, the book was obviously partial to Nike and Phil Knight. After reading this book, I was unsure if I could take the Nike Company at face value. Katz glosses over the issue of Nike's sweatshops, a topic which I was very interested in, and hoped to learn more about through this book. Nike is known for its powerful advertising, and Just Do It gave me many insights to the great extent that Nike goes to in making the perfect commercial.",3
"I have been a Susan Johnson fan for several years. Her stories of the Lakota Indian family (I forgot the name, but Blaze is the mother) were wonderful. Her stories are always hot and sexy with real relationships between passionate people who are not afraid to express their love for each other. While this book had her trademarks, it seemed very contrived with her trying too hard to put the hero and heroine into situations that you knew were made up just to be made up.I love her still, however, and hope she recaptures the spirit of Blaze's family in her future books.I hate to critique, however, because if I could write I'd be doing it.",3
"These women know their swing. From rocking originals like ""Salvatore"" to reinterpreted traditionals like ""Frailoch,"" this album satisfies the need within all of us for reedy rhythms. Amy Denio is an extremely talented musician AND an exceptional bandleader, and it shows. The players have obviously spent many hours practicing together, and each song is richer for the effort. Music like this, played only for the sheer love of playing, is as good as it gets.",3
"Four saxophones and occasional drums yield a good mix of soundplay. Traditional songs like ""Frailoch,"" innovative compositions like ""I Will Be Sad,"" and thoughtful pieces like ""Bus Horn Concerto"" are rich and stand up well to repeat listenings. Unfortunately, the recording is just muddy enough to keep this from getting a fourth star.Fans of Amy Denio shouldn't pass this up - even if her tremendous vocal talents aren't showcased, her compostion and instrumental accomplishment shine.",3
"I have one of these jacks supporting the rear of my trailer in the driveway, it is rock steady even with four people in the trailer. I like it that these are light weight (steel jack stands can be quite heavy) and I like that these come apart easily and stack up into a compact set for storage.As far as using these for camping: hmmm. They are really too short for my camper, so I'll need to haul 2x6 pieces around to raise them up. Also, the head (the piece that touches the frame of the trailer) doesn't swivel well under load and can pop off of the frame while you are raising the stand. And the steel parts (the nut and the screw) aren't galvanized so they rust.",3
"The movie could have been better if they left out Nicolette's horrific so called acting. all the other actors did their characters justice! The make-up in first 12yrs for the female actress for the story line was gruesom, but it did get better!! All in all the movie was fine I would recommend buying this movie @ a discount only!!",3
"This is a good book for younger female audiences (10-17). The characters appeal to the reader and the descriptions are superb. The reader gets a real sense of who these people are and what summer in Silverton, Colorado, is like. I empathized with Lissa and her desire to make a life away from her aunt, who has managed her life since she was orphaned.. John is the typical ""rescuer"" but we cheer him on in his escape from his devious ex-wife, who plots to remove Lissa from his life forever.",3
"We recently purchased a 1934 Spanish Eclectic that needs not only restoration of it's former architectural integrity, but an addition to make the home work for us. This book was a good choice to provide us with a photographic ""library"" of Spanish-style homes to reference. I do wish there had been more devotion to the ""casitas"" section of middle-class homes and less to buildings dedicated to government or business; and perhaps more photographs of interiors. But it's still a great find and a wonderful addition for anyone who collects either books on architecture in general or on California architecture specifically.",4
"Hard to find these days, but worth picking up. Lots of hidden goodies on here. Can't go wrong with Sepultura's ""Chaos B.C."". And the run from Crawlspaces ""My Ruin"" all the way up to Cubanate's ""Oxyacetylene"" is full of awesome. Alien Factory's ""Higher"" is one fast paced track that fits at home at any rave. And Crystal Method's ""Come2gether"" is good not matter what mood im in.If you avoid the warts (Like G/Z/R's 'Outworld'), you have a good time with this CD.",4
Timely service and as described. I really prefer to know the editions publish date as I seek issues from 1999 and newer if possible.,4
Escape from Alcatraz depicts the full history of this infamous prison stronghold. It reflects how life was on the Rock and details the circumstances when and how 23 convicts attempted or succeeded in escaping from the island prison - the latter few never to be ever seen or heard of again. If you are interested in Alcatraz you need go no further than reading this book - it is really that good !,4
This is a beautifully conceived and photographed book of faces of people of mixed races who are wholly American. On the facing page is a handwritten paragraph of how they see themselves. It's wonderful.,4
"Great book -- I just wish it was longer! I gave a copy to my sister, who has two daughters adopted from China -- so although her kids are 100% Asian, it is likely she will have Hapa grandchildren. I also gave a copy to a friend whose husband is from the Phillipines and has 3 beautiful Hapa children --- they liked the book so much, they bought copies for their children and grandchildren. Beautiful photography, and wonderful insights into being part Asian, 100% Hapa, in an anglo world. My favorite quote is from the boy who said he is 'part Danish, but I usually don't tell people that because they think I am a pastry'.",4
"I am 100% Hapa, i was born and raised in Hawaii and i am very familar with the term and pleased to see it making its way into mainstream culture. I bought this book as a fathers day gift for my husband who is always asking why our first son looks nothings like him (he is Irish) and i am Hawaiian-Irish-Portugese.I only wish that the title of the book was more inclusive of Hawaiian and Pacific islanders who are also Hapa and originated the term.",4

"Before picking this book up to read I was aware of the knowledge I needed on African American's in the Education system. After reading it I felt empowered and sad. Empowered because now I had a little more knowledge and saddened because now I know what was kept from me all my school years. It amazes me how we were not taught any of our history not even in college. It also amazes me how people got away with not educating us.Dr. Carter shows us how 30 years ago the system was designed to keep us ignorant and as experiments. Quote from Dr. Woodson ""Negroes, being objects of charity, have received them cordially and have done what they were required."" To this day they are still using the same system but I think we are smarter now and know where the resources are to get what we need.Reviewed by Missy",4
"I am a twenty-four year old African American man and I read this book six years ago, and even at that young age I found it ""On point"". Dr. Woodson wrote this book over 60 years ago and his observations of social and educational conditions hold true to this day. This book was my introduction to my continuing studies of African American history, and I recommend that anyone beginning their studies begin with this book. There will be many instances when you will nod your head in agreement with what is stated, and other times when you will learn things about your own behaviors that you could not previously understand. The only reason that I couldn't give this book five stars is because it is a scholarly text and it is a little difficult for less sophisticated readers.",4
"The negative, incredulous readers/reviewers should read Psychiatry: The Ultimate Betrayal by Bruce Wiseman as the companion to this book. It very well may change your mind about your opinion of this work and others like it.",4
I stumbled upon this book while researching a different subject. Wow! Everyone should read this book. So enlightening. People of all educational levels will benefit from the wisdom of Mr. Woodson.,4
"I found this book to be very informatative and I was pleasantly surprised by all the valueable information that was within the pages of this book. What impressed me the most was the wealth of information concerning the African American people, especially the male gender. I brought this book because I am studying the Hebrew roots of the Christian faith and this book has clarified many questions I had about why we such a hated race of people. I wish I could buy this book for ever black male and female who is not proud of who he or she is because of a lack of knowledge of our heritage, which has been stolen from us way back in the 1600's which is actually 15th century and has been replaced with the Europeans. If you have no identity than you will become what others say your are. This book should be taught to every black elementary student as a History course so that they will come to know who they really are and where they come from.",4
"Overall, the HomeRight Auto Wash Stick works well on flat surfaces but if your car has wheel well mouldings, fender flares, spoilers, air dams, roof racks, or just about anything not flat, I find it hard to get those areas. And many places can't be gotten to no matter what. It earns a 4 star because where it can be used it works pretty good. If your car is an easy car to wash then perhaps you will really like it. Mine is a hard one to wash so when I get done, I let it dry then go back and wash the areas I missed by hand. Even with that, it's still easier and quicker than washing the whole thing with a sponge. Plus the long handle makes it easier to do the roof without stretching or reaching and the lower areas without stooping. It feels a little light duty and I worry how long it will last, but if it holds up well I would probably buy another.",4
"The backing for the mitt has a slight curve and fairly soft flex that does a surprisingly good job on and around door trim. Uses more washing solution than hand washing, but that is the only negative.",4

"I purchased this product 2 years ago and still use it now and then. The smooth rollers are comfortable to grip w/o over heating your hair and fingers. The rollers form a medium curl and the clip helps smooth out frizzies. I give this product 4 stars only because the clips do not hold tight enough. I find them easy to loosen or fall out even if I am sitting still. I have long, thick, wavy hair so the roller clips may hold thinner hair better; although, that may be the ones that end up with the crease.",4
"This is perhaps the 5th set of electric style rollers that I have owned. It's probably the best, in that it heats up very quickly, which is, after all, why I use this type of product. It also has the same flaw that most electric rollers have, which no fool proof way of fastening them so that they stay in the hair. This product has a squeeze clip that fastens over the roller, once it is wrapped with your hair. It also heats up, to transfer heat to the hair from both the inside and the out. It also will leave a ""crease"" in the lock of hair, from where is clips on. No way to avoid it. I use the rollers along with a curling brush, to smooth out the crease in the front, which fixes the problem for me. Meanwhile, if you use electric rollers in general, this set is quick, and delivers a firm curl in a reasonably short period of time.",4
"I love this! Works great and is so easy to use.The big selling point for me is IT HEATS UP FAST! My old unit takes FOREVER to heat up. I just can't wait that long in the AM so I haven't used it for a long time. This heats up in less than 2 minutes.There are more than enough rollers for my hair and I found it easy to wrap my hair around them. My hair doesn't snag on these rollers at all. The clips hold my hair perfectly and after about 10 minutes I take everything off, I spray my hair and I have a head of beautiful bouncy curls.And this thing is going to last for a long time as it's very well made and high quality.But, there's no way I can keep it on my bathroom counter. It takes up a bit more space than I have free. So, I set it up on a shelf and that works fine.I appreciate having a space in the back of the unit for the plug. No more dangling cords!I'm really happy with this.",4
"Anthony Robbins is a powerful presenter. And he has a lot of practical good advice in these CDs. They are a bit pricey but...I found it useful to play each CD twice, really absorb what he is saying. I also try to go back every two or three months for a refresher session. And don't forget to keep the daily journal he recommends.If you are serious and put in the time, it will help you. It's a way of life not a one shot experience. It takes practice and commitment to implement his ideas, to succeed.So what else is new?Bottom line: this set is a useful self-improvement tool. But be sure to devote the necessary time to incorporate the ideas into your thinking and your actions.Good luck!",4

"This book provides introductory passages that illuminate the art of Tai Chi Chuan, and set a beginner on a path to cultivate internal energy. Translations of famous masters take up another chapter. The book covers all of the major styles, although the illustrations for each form(except for the simplified form) are probably meant for informative purposes only; they're not detailed enough that the reader could learn the form from studying the illustrations. Including chapters on martial applications, further combative situations involving the gentle art, weapons, meditation and Taoism, this book is probably the most thorough Tai Chi Chuan book out there. I highly recommend it.",4
"I got this cd player because I had such a hard time finding lullibies on tape. I had read the other comments but thought I would give it a try anyway.Bad points- It DOES skip when its hit, so don't hit it. The light IS dim, so what? I want the kids to sleep not see what to get into! The music IS low even on the highest setting, but then again the whole house isn't listening to it.Good points- It plays the whole CD then shuts itself off. (At least mine does!) It uses CDs which can be found ANYWHERE. Its small enough that I can put it on the wall side of my crib and I know my other children CAN'T play with it!! The buttons are a pain to get to, but thats GREAT where kids are concerned, right??As for the batteries, I've had mine a few weeks, play it EVERY night and have yet to replace the batteries.I happen to really like mine. Give it a try, save your receipt and make up your own mind.",4
"I really like this CD player. I do not understand why it has such a low review.*Yes the light is dim but I did not want a bright light. It is a nightlite. It is just fine. I can check on baby and see him fine.*The volume does not get very loud but for what this is designed for it is fine. I put in a lullaby CD and he drifts off to sleep.*The timer function if great.*The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I wish the digital readout and the buttons lite up. It is hard to see in the dark and I do not like to turn on the light to see the buttons and digital read out. Maybe in the next version the manufacture will include this.*As far as the CD's ckipping when hit, I solved that by sliding a piece of foam between the play and the rails of the crib. No there is no space to move at all and it does not skip.***It is not perfect but it does the trick!***",4
"I love my cd player. My baby uses it every time she goes to sleep...at night and for naps. I like it cause it shuts off itself. I gave it 4 stars cause I wish it would play louder,...but it truly is worth buying!",4
"Even tho these crib CD players were manufactured quite a while ago, they are still available; I bought mine at a Goodwill store. It was wonderful when our grandchildren were in cribs, but they still enjoy it when they come to spend the night. I guess it never occurred to me that an infant would need stereo sound. The volume level is sufficient for an child, since the idea is to lull the baby to sleep and not to ruin the child's eardrums. The nightlight is just enough for a child to feel safe, and yet not bright enough to keep him/her awake. Yes, it is difficult to replace the batteries but as any grandparent can tell you, if something is hard to open, give it to a child. I wouldn't want it to be easier, for safety reasons. Our 6 yr old granddaughter is staying the night and is thrilled that I found the missing CD player which I can hook onto a standard headboard.",4
"My husband and I wanted to buy this for our kids to play the lullabye CDs people had given as baby gifts, but we couldn't justify paying $50. I happened to find a used one at a rummage sale for a dollar! Much more reasonable.PROS: plays any CD; good volume control for a crib (a baby doesn't need surround sound to fall asleep); battery compartment is secured well; ""C"" batteries are best as rechargeables for something like this, since it's used every day; optional timer and programming buttons are good to customize baby's routine; dim nightlight is just enough for you see where the pacifier fell while you reset the music in the middle of the night without waking babyCONS: PRICE; CD door takes two hands to open and is noisy; I kind of wish it had a optional wall-mount or desk base for post-crib use",4
I really love this player; the light is just right for a baby; the sound is very good;I can hear it playing in the baby's room from my room at the other end of the house. My only complaint is it is hard to open but in a way that is ok too; we don't want the baby playing with it! I highly recommend this item. I may have to buy another because my 8 year old uses it after the baby is asleep!,4
"I really dont agree with the other reviews on the cd player. I can hear the player on high from a good distance and really only use the player when she is going to sleep, so how high does it have to go? I dont keep it on high as not to keep her awake, and the only issue is the light doesnt shine as bright as I thought. I keep it attached to the crib not near her head either.I dont get what the other reviewers dont get. Mine works great",4
"This book is good at first part, which provides the basic understanding on cryptography. But it is not understandable for the second part on modern algorithms and public key. I still cannot understand the advantage of modern algorithms over the ancient cryptography.The chapter Key Management seems to long for such a small issue, while the modern algorithms seems to short for such a big issue.",4
"If you want an accurate introduction to the concepts and vocabulary of cryptography, this is the book for you. The authors are clearly knowledgeable but manage to make the information provided accessable to the beginner. There are simple examples to acquaint you with some of the principles of coding and breaking codes. This is a complex subject and some of the ideas will take you into deep water. There is an excellent bibliography that one can refer to for more technical details. The book would benefit from a glossary of acronyms as some of the terminology was hard to keep straight. There could have been a little less discussion of key management. Over all a very useful and informative book.",4
I bought this for a christmas gift.The dvd was a great deal with good reviews so i purchased it for my brother.,4

"My 2 year old called this a dino and not a dragon and doesn't relate to wood stoves, different era I suppose. But from the first day he reads this 5 times in a row so it must be fun for him. I don't love that ever since he asks for milk and cookies at night...",4
"My four year old enjoys receiving Ladybug magazine in the mail. It has sweet little stories and is somewhat entertaining. However, he much prefers National Geographic Kids and High Five. Not sure whether it's the nature of the content or the style/layout, but it's not the biggest hit in our house.",4
"We just got our first issue of Ladybug Magazine. My 2 1/2 year olds enjoyed it, but I think some of the stories in there are for older children, probably a year older than mine are. That said, the publisher does give a range (2-6, I believe)and I do think that the kids will grow into enjoying all the features of the magazine. Its nice to have something other than Highlights, which the kids also enjoy.",4
I am a primary teacher and I was looking for books to use with my higher readers. This series of books was suggeted to me and I am very thankful. My first graders love them and I am working on buying the complete set.,4
"A group of kids awaits a book signing with their favorite mystery author, Wallis Wallace. But the author never shows, and the kids find it strange. As they follow clues, they think Wallis Wallace has been kidnapped.I like this book because it's pure kid imagination. It's what kids wish would happen. Who didn't want to be part of a mystery crew like on Scooby Doo or this A - Z Mysteries crew? The start to this series is imaginative, fun and keeps you interested.",4
"The best part of this lens is that it is stabilized and f/2.8. I can take had held shots at weddings regardless of the lighting.The downside is that it is not nearly as sharp or high quality as a L lens. It sucks a lot of dust inside which doesn't affect the pictures but could eventually be a mechanical issue. It is not sharp until around f/8 and does not handle contrast or vivid colors as well as L glass.I would recommend buying this if you need to take hand held shots with a zoom, in low light. Otherwise buy a L or a couple primes.",4
Overall it's a very good lens butts for the price make sure you really look before you buy these lengths I'm not upset that I bought them because I do video shooting but for that money it's not worth it it got better and cheaper lens out there that gives you the same type of quality,4
"I am very pleased with this lens. Last week I took approx. 700 pictures on a trip to Iran, mainly using this lense. The IS, together with the f/2.8 makes it a very good indoor lens. I some of the museums you are not allowed to use flash; this lens is solving that problem.I believa that the softness I expire in the photos is because of my D40 camerahouse, not the lens.What I am missing:- the weather-proofing you get on the L-series- the Lens Hood should be a part of the (expensive) lens- A pouch should be a part of the (expensive) lens",4

"Heinrich Boell's ""Ansichten eines Clowns"" is a fresco of postwar Germany, a very different landscape than today's. Boell's generation were tortured by remorse - and justly so; remorse humanized them. This is a novel about pain, loss and ethics: individual ethics and collective ethics; about how Hans remains faithful to his beliefs to the bitter end, about how Marie takes the path that she has to take. Together with Guenter Grass's ""The Tin Drum"" (published four years earlier), the ""Clown"" is the greatest novel of the Erhard period.",4
As a layperson I cannot comment on the accuracy of the translation but it reads elegantly and the ethos and sometimes pathos of the writers are blatantly palpable. They can be read aloud easily as they most certainly were intended for such a purpose. Two of the writers (Clement of Alexandria and Ignatius of Antioch) quite likely had direct contact with the original Apostles. The Didache may predate the gospels. In any case this collection gives a good glimpse of Christianity at its very early form. Essential reading indeed.,4
"Very good introduction to the writings of the apostolic fathers. However, I feel it was a major oversight for the author and/or publisher not to include the Epistle of Barnabus and Shepherd of Hermas in the book since these two documents are crucial to the study of early church literature. Apart from this obvious mistake, a very good book.",4
"Swindoll is always a gifted writer giving special insight to the reader. ""Esther"" brings to life the struggles and emotions one faces in life's difficult situations. Esther reflects poise, strength and courage in the midst of trials. This is an encouraging and one the most thoughtful accounts of Esther that I have read.",4
"Having ordered this book as ""new condition"" I was disappointed when it was delivered and all the corners were slightly bent. I don't mind that it was only slightly damaged. I do mind however that it was advertised as ""new.""",4
"This is a much needed tool for potty training! The only thing we would change is the ""potty guard"". It should be higher so that it covers the private parts on little boys. Sometimes we end up with a mess.",4
This is working great for us. So far she's pee'ed (spelling?) a few times and does not feel uncomfortable sitting here. Definitely a great product.,4
"My son is just getting started, but he is now wanting to sit on the potty with clothes on about 5 times a day and today he did when he first woke up. The base is nice because it has a grip and does not slide easily. I like the pull out cup too. We got white so it will be the same as everybody and maybe he will feel he is doing the same thing as everyone else. I DO reccommend this potty.",4
"I have a 14 month old. He sits on it. He doesn't scream. he's not using it as a potty yet. He climbs on it and listens to his echo while putting his face into it. Seems comfortable, will be easy to clean, not to big and akward. I'm sure it will do the job",4
"I wanted a chair with a removable bowl, but now that I've seen my son grab it and attempt to dump it out, part of me wishes I'd have gone for a toilet adapter style.If this is the style you want though, it's durable and sleek in appearance (for a potty chair, anyway).ETA: OK, now I'm glad that the bowl is removable as we're using it more, but you do have to watch for spills. It cleans easily and my son finds it comfortable.",4
"My son is now 2 years 8 months, and we started out potty training on the green frog. It's known as ""ribbit"". Well ""ribbit"" wasn't very deep, and didn't have any type of rubber gripping on the bottom of it. He seemed to be getting way too big for it. So my biggest concern was depth, and height of the back. I still wanted him to feel safe, but not pee pee over the edge. I am very pleased with the depth of this one. It fits him really good now. I'm a little worried about it fitting for the next 3 months, but we're working on it and I hope that he is potty trained in the next few months. I like the bottom of this Baby Bjorn because it does have rubber edging all along the bottom edge so it doesn't slide around the bathroom. It also has a really good front potty blocker. I would especially recommend this for parents with boys.",4
"My kids love this potty, but it does leave a red mark. It doesn't seem to bother them and it goes away rather quickly. They like this potty better than sitting on the big potty.",4
"i returned a different potty same day to purchase this one. the other potty seemed more comfortable with a cushion seat but my daughter slid off the back side and seemed like if she went in it she would squirt out the front. this potty chair she could lounge in comfortably without me thinking she's going to fall off the back, i thought it would be hard but she enjoyed looking at a book on it. the only issue i had was she got excited and tried to get off of it by herself and hit the front guard, flipping over and going facefirst into our bathroom shelving. at first glace we thought she broke her nose right across the bridge. luckily she isn't scared of the potty and her nose is ok....i'm sure as she grows a little she will be able to get off easier but just a warning, i do love this potty a lot better than the first one we got.",4
"She's still being potty trained, but she likes to sit on the chair. Easy to clean. The only draw back is that she can play with the removable bowl. She takes it out. It's simple.",4
"My son was 17 months old when I ordered/recieved this item. He was just getting interested in the potty and trying to take his clothes off. When I got the package he was right there and he tried it out right away. he fits perfectly on it, but it is a little ackward for a beiginer. Now a month latter he is seasoned at sitting down on it and getting back up. He is almost potty trained and I am convinced it is because of this potty chair.",4
"I bought this for my granddaughter as she is starting to show an interest in getting those diapers off. She likes it. It wasn't boring or scary. Which is one reason why I decided on this chair, bright colors are more interesting to a tot. She has been sitting on it. But we aren't at the take off the diaper stage yet. I do think this will be perfect for her!",4
"When I began my research for a potty chair for my son, I had no idea how many things there were to consider! I really didn't want anything that made noise or had lights but we ultimately decided on this chair because of the one-piece splash guard since I learned that it wasn't uncommon for little boys to hurt their tender bits on other chairs. It is well-made and sturdy; it didn't tip when my son got on or off. I think the main thing it did was to give my son the confidence to use a potty - his feet stayed securely on the ground and it was stable and didn't slip around. He had no problem getting himself on and off of it and he liked the 'responsibility' of dumping the contents into the big potty (I liked that it was easy for him to do that, and easy for me to clean the bowl afterward).",4
"My 2.5 year old is a big kid, 40 lbs, 38"" tall. He needs a bigger potty chair, which this is. We have the smaller baby bjorn potty we were using but he can't keep his pee in it, he's just too big. I like that the potty cup comes out to wash, but it often sticks to his bottom as he stands up from it. We've had urine on the floor several times just because of this. I ask him to hold the white cup down when he stands up, he just gets over excited when he goes and stands up right away to look inside. He sat on one at a friends house that had a cover over the removable cup, which is by far a better design, but the high back on this one makes a nice spot for spending extended amounts of time on it as he reads and tries to go. All in all, I like it and would recommend it with reservations.",4
"The Babybjorn Potty Chair has many nice features. Easy to clean--supports child, compact sturdy and simple. BUT if your child is small (like mine) the guard on the front is cumbersome. My child can't not mount the potty himself and must be placed on the potty. When he tries to get on the potty he has hurt himself in ways that makes any male member of the household wince.",4
"has a larger ""drop"" opening than a convertible potty that fits onto a toilet seat and step; better chance of your child pooping into the potty as opposed to pooping on the rear of the sitting area. However, the sitting area on the rear is also wide. If your child sits all the way back, there's a chance he/she can poop on the seat.",4
"This potty is the best. My daughter can fit on it easily unlike her previous potty. It's not the most attractive potty, very simple/plain. Overall it serves it's purpose.",4
"This IS a great potty. Easy to clean and simple in design, HOWEVER, if your son has learned to stand up to pee, then be prepared for messes and spills over the bowl and under the bowl to clean up. Of course, we are teaching him to aim in the bottom of the bowl, but in the meantime, we continue to clean up under the bowl because he aims toward the backside of the potty, which then leaks underneath the top piece and onto the floor.I still give it 4 stars because of the simple design, and I love that you just lift the top part and clean/empty it. I would've gotten their one piece smaller potty, however, my son is 2 1/2 and a big boy, so I wasn't sure if he would fit on the seat.",4
"Doc Martin is a rascal that can't be kept down. In his tiny village by the sea, he now has to deal with a baby as well as the prospect of marriage, and the whole village is still at him with all of their inane problems. Just what will he do?Season 5 seems to bring a sense of humanity to the good doctor that I felt has been long in coming. His passion and knowledge is put to the test with the arrival of a new doctor and everyone in the village are at the ends of their sanity.The wit and dry-humor are well portrayed in this series and I look forward to the release of season 6 in the near future.",4
"I've enjoyed the series tremendously, they're very entertaining. The story line continues to grow, never boring. I zipped through Series 5 and am anxiously awaiting the next season.",4
"The four stars are for a couple of episodes where the DVD stops in places for a few seconds before moving on. I hope they don't become permanent!Otherwise, it would be 5 stars for a great series with great actors and stories.",4
"This is the book you need for creating and maintaining a solid and authentic classroom literacy program. ""The First Twenty Days"" alone is extreemely helpful. You can start small and grow as you feel comfortable. A little overwhelming at times but worth it!",4
This book has helped me tremendously with my new job as a teacher. Going to school did not prepare me as much as this book has.,4
"It's a big book and I've only skimmed it. But, I've already incorporated a lot of ideas into my classroom and my 3rd grade students aren't complaining...rather they're enjoying language arts. Of course, TAKS is not until February so time will tell if it works according to my state's standards.I'm excited about another F&P; product that I saw by chance in the principal's hallway. My admins have ordered the Word Study program. I'm sure this will really help me with the Word Study part of the total F&P; Reading & Writing ""system"" [which is what the Guiding Readers & Writers book is all about].",4
"Good vibe, a bit of a homemade musical quality, and A+ lyrics...makes you remember how good a good country rockin song can be...highly recommended",4
"i would wear it more often, but it is short, so i feel like i have to hide that fact by tucking it into a coat. i love the print, though.",4
"Janis Joplin rocks on this release! Jefferson Airplane are not usually good live, but in this instance, they've polished up their act to sound best on TV! Richie Havens has always had a special place in my heart and his performances here are good. Vanilla Fudge is nothing but pure 60's nostalgia, nothing more. They're not much live, to tell you the truth. I believe that's everyone, if I'm missing somebody, it's cause they weren't that memorable.",4
"One is hard-pressed to find such a well-crafted book as this. The melodramatic goings-on of the have and the have-nots as played out in this plot will have one yelling ""yes"" or ""no"" at every turn. While not a book of tremendous substance, it is a wonderful look back at a time when senses of decorum and verisimilitude ruled the young and the old, and one's standing in society was ultimately more important than one's happiness. If that is not enough to persuade you to read this book, then how 'bout: It's a really great read and you'll finish all 506 pages in a sitting or two.",4
"A post-magical apocalypse political thriller and story about succession and inheritance in several senses.Stewart writes beautifully and creates original, well-detailed worlds. There were two aspects of this book that didn't work so well for me: first, the political thriller plot became incoherent, and second, the Chinatown culture seemed stereotypical (martial arts, empty cups of tea, whatever). On the other hand, I loved his evocation of the North Coast forest, and the way the elegance of his descriptions is grounded by down-to-earth characters and moments of humor.I'd recommend this, but not as strongly as GALVESTON or CLOUDS END.",4
"I like Sean Stewart (disclosure) but think that Perfect Circle and Mockingbird are his best works. This is quite different from those books, but still and interesting read. Perhaps this is more comparable to Galveston.This is not a ""big world"" book. It focuses on two cities in a future where magic has become strong (but is beginning to ebb again) and the two different cultures these cities have and the differences between them.It has some very clever magic. Forests that are conscious and protect some of the characters and dead armies that lightly interact with the living.Ultimately, it is a little flat in character development, but an interesting read.",4
"Overall, very good. Lot's of helpful advice. My only gripe is that training charts are written in minutes, not miles (author assumes a 10 minute mile). While this is nice from a stop-watch point of view, for those of us who run faster (or in my case, slower) than a 10 minute mile, the book was unclear whether it's more important to focus on time or mileage in one's training....",4
"We bought this for our grandson, one for his home and one for ours in hopes of getting him to want to go on the toilet and rid him of his diapers. He is now just over 2 and no luck so far but we like the seat and we are sure he will some day soon.",4
This is a nice seat but the adjustable part in the back doesn't really work for our toilet. It's ok though since it stays on the toilet nicely and doesn't move around. Works great for our little boy,4
"Easy to clean. Stays in place (even w/o using the built-in ""lock""). Seems comfrontable. Splash guard could be larger (but let's be honest, unless you're putting a Jai alai cesta on there, not sure anything is really going to contain the misses of an active 2yr old boy!)",4
"I like the style and ease of this potty seat, but for my daughter, the hole is much too big. She squirms on it, and will not use it unless I am holding onto her-she starts to slip and fall in. I am having to end up buying a much smaller seat. Hopefully she will grow into this one. She is 2 1/2 and a little on the small side.",4
"Love this seat. My daughter is almost 3 and fits perfect on it. No slipping around and fits any size toilet. I gave it 4 stars because I feel it's a lot of money for a toilet seat, but it works better then the ""fun"" cartoon kind.",4
"Here is what I like about this:- you can adjust some fitting with the turn of a dial on the inside back of the seat so that it doesn't shift when on the Toilet (this way I can use it on different toilet bowls and it sits steady)- just one piece (that way things don't get in between the pieces), less mess and easy to clean- contoured etc and all the stuff they say in their descriptionWhat I wish was different: I wish that the seat was a little cushioned. If he's been on the potty for a while, poor thing has red marks on his butt. (it goes away, just don't like seeing that)",4
just starting out but the potty fits great on an adult toilet and is great for a boy sitting down.,4
"I would have given this product 5 stars for design, comfort and ease of use but quality was a big issue. As most moms who are potty training know, it's kind of messy. I was wiping down the potty seat with a Lysol wipe and the oval handle at the back of the potty seat cracked along the plastic edge. The potty seat can still be used, but it was disappointing considering the price. I probably wouldn't let this discourage me from purchasing the product. It's a great design that can be used easily and makes the potty look more comfortable for little ones.",4
"This was in between the bjorn potty and the real toilet and my son really didn't mind using the big toilet with this. He felt very secure. If needed, it's easy to take on a car trip for other bathrooms.",4
"Overall, I'm very happy with this product. No wonder everybody raves about it!The only feature that needs to be improved are the handles on the sides.This is quite a pricey toilet trainer and it deserves handles.",4
"Our daughter has been getting better at warning us when she has to use the potty, thanks to the reliability of this product. As other reviewers have noted, it does not move and is very stable.Pros:- if your child likes pink, your child will like this!- stable adjustable adapter- easy to clean: no soft cushion or other places for urine to accumulateCons:- for the price, it would be nice to include a hook designed to hold the seat, say...one that hangs over the edge of the water tank, or an adhesive mount on the side- no side grip handles",4
"This seat is great - it has a mechanism that fits it to your toilet so it won't rock or slide and is solid plastic construction, so it won't crack like the padded seats do (will definitely last through my babies and can be passed along in great condition). The pee guard doesn't work great for my baby yet (we EC and he's 13 months and small for his age anyway, so it'll probably do better as he grows). He feels safe on it, though, and can sit independently quite well and is similar in shape and feel to his Baby Bjorn Little Potty, so it works for us!",4
"We tried a couple of other options before finding this seat. It is far better than other potty rings b/c it clamps onto the toilet seat so it doesnt wiggle around. The others were hard for my son to balance b/c they moved back and forth on our elongated seat. This one solved that problem. It is also more contoured so it seemed a more comfortable fit for him.It is easy to remove and place. We did finally opt for a built in all in one seat when my son started learning to pee standing up because it was even easier to get out of the way but, for just starting potty training, this seat is quite good - a step above the other potty rings.",4
This potty seat fit on all of my different toilet seats without a problem. My son can sit on it for long periods of time without getting uncomfortable. He's on the younger side at 18mo and the fit is just fine for him. The splash guard could of course be a little higher but we haven't had any major issues with this one. It does what it's supposed to and the ability to adjust the seat for a snug fit is what makes this seat so good. Other seats have slid around and this one stays put.,4
"If you have a boy... this is the only one that would fit the needs. We tried three other brands before this one and while they had their own merits, none would understand a boys needs better than this one. Fits perfectly on the toilet and can be adjusted if needed.",4
This is a pretty good album. A few of the songs are tear-jerkers and tear-jerk they will. A very beautiful score for a very sad movie.,4
"Without revealing too much about my feelings towards the movie, the soundtrack definitely stuck out amongst the drama, crazy characters, and melancholic undertones of the film. It is a picture perfect example of where sometimes the music is so good, it steals the attention away from the film itself. Particularly noteworthy is ""Loverly Spring,"" a cracked-out, hyper-happy ditty about a little elf, and a jaunty rendition of a classical piece played during the final credits, which, unfortunately, seems to have been omitted from the soundtrack. ""Drive Away"" is also ridiculously catchy and perfectly dark for this bizarre film.Well done, Mr. Newman.",4
"This is a nice unit to carry in the shirt pocket. I hate the lack of an optical view, the LCD is NOT convenient for point and shoot type photos. Especially out-doors. This is a special purpose camera and is very good for posed in-door or nature shots. Also, in the practical use of this unit, it is best to crank it down to the 3.2 pxl mode, or other lower res. The close shots at 5 pxl are phenomenal, every detail of a product label for example is perfectly reproduced. Good toy, but I like my DSC-P73 for every day use.UPDATE: 3/08 Still going strong, batery life is excellent, I use it regularly to document daily events around the house, have a date stamped history of baking, cooking, re-model events and renovations. Also have on several ocaisions taken before and during pics of projects that are useful in re-asembly and restoration.",4
Very easy to operate. This camera takes beautiful pictures outside. The lighting has to be right inside.,4
"I wish there were photos of the insides on Amazon or Kensington's website. It has more room than I thought it would. The back is especially roomy - it's divided by the handle assembly, bit there's exactly enough room for my Bose QuietComfort2 case on one side and my laptop powerbrick and food on the other side.The inside main compartment has enough room for TWO 15"" computers (although only one would be padded), plus a few folders, mags or paperback books. Based on the ads and some other comments, I thought the styling might be too ""girly"", but it's not. The strap is hard to remove, so I just keep it short and leave it on. I was able to use the strap to attach it on my main luggage for wheeling through the airport. By itself, the handle is a good length (I'm 5'8"").",4
"Wishmaster, Nemo and Oceanborn all rate higher than a five so this just gets a five (let's farget about the horror tha was Century Child). It's a really powerful album although not as classic as the other albums, Tarja stull has a powerful voice especially in Elvenpath and Astral Romance. Get this album. Though if your a newbie then I recommend Wishmaster and Oceanborn first.",5
"first off i not a kid ect. This album is excellent, but the only thing I didnt like was the male vocals, but Tarja's voice is beautiful. Anway except for the male vocals, this was an amazing CD.",5
The Discs were in original unopened packaging and work perfectly. We love the series and enjoyed the extras at the end.,5
"to the reviewer whodat, the price for all the sets are the same. Amazon chose to only give a discount of 15% on this set as compared to 25% off on the first two.",5
"I first seen this movie when i was about 10 years old. It really freaked me out with its wierdness but years after, when i got to about 19 years old, i still couldnt get it out of my head. Then i started wondering if its out on DVD, to my surprise, it was! WOW! I thought i was the only one who really dig this film, slapstick humour, perfectly cast characters, some sexy, not to mention, psycho chicks & troma style gore! Even the main characters get in touch with thier darkside's! Its a classic & includes a lot of characters from the toxic avenger movies. Its a classic troma film, & a stand-alone awesome independant film aswell. If u aint seen a Troma film b4, definetly check it out. It bends hollywood rules & goes beyond them! Lloyd Kaufman's a genius! Its a low budget film but some of the special FX will amaze you....By the way, i havent even got the 1 with special features like deleted scenes & commentary, so even more reason to buy this, i am.",5
Class of Nuke Em'High is so awesomely bad!!! It is the best 'bad' movie I have ever seen! I have watched this movie over and over for more than 10 years... I know every word and every scene... I can also point out all the mess-up's!! I never get tired of seeing this film!!,5
"If you have seen the movies or know the story, the book is a completely different experiance! Beautiflly written and so much more than just a story about a man who doesn't age while the portrait does. Captivating and darkly thought provoking.. Great writting and facinating characters. Highly recommended!",5
I have watched the old movie of this story and the newer one but had never read the book. This was excellent!,5
"Classical, timeless and wonderfully written tale of that expands on the 'how evil corrupts your soul' theory.",5
"I listened to the audio version, which was a delight. This classic impresses upon the reader the importance of Christ's rhetorical question: what does it profit a man to gain the whole word but lose his soul? Wilde also underscores the point that true beauty resides in the eternal soul not the temporal body. This is a book to read and re-read.",5
"I was highly impressed by this novel of arts, society, morality and immortality. It has to be one of the most deepest things that I have ever read. One thing that bothered me a little was how Oscar Wilde went through this long winded prose and at times became a bit essay like but it had gave me food for thought.",5
"I haven't actually read the book yet, but dang does it look good on my shelf! Penguin clothbound is wonderful.",5
"Great book, very quick read and a must for anyone who really wants to understand the english cannon. I think I've seen 3 ""Twilight Zone"" episodes that feature the same plot though, kind of ruined the surprise halfway through...",5
I love this book! I completely think that I have fallen in love with the character Lord Henry. He is by far one of the wittiest characters that I have ever read in a book and trust me that I have read many books! I think that Oscar Wilde was a genius and this is one of the best literary works that he has written.It is a story of innocence lost and the quest of forever staying young.,5
"This is a beautiful book, full of vivid word pictures. Wilde is a genius of literature. Everyone should read this book",5
"The Picture of Dorian Gray is an amazing story told with such wonderful truth and cynicysim as only Wilde could tell it. Not only do I have much of the book highlighted, but it is worn from reading again and again. I would definitly reccomend this brilliant novel to anyone who wants to walk away with a feeling as if they've discovered a treasure they must share with the world.",5
This is a beautiful and witty tale about a depraved man. His ugly soul is mirrored by his ever-changing portrait while he retains his youthful visage. Suspenseful throughout. A classic.,5
This book is a facsinating read that blends insult and injury quite well. Fat and ugly people surely will be delighted or destroyed. Wittisms roar and pundits will roll in hedonism for the intelligentsia. A must-read for good-looking people and geniuses everywhere.,5
"After reading this story of a man who is so caught up in beauty that he ruins his life over it, I took the time to examine my own feelings on many things....Wilde has done it again in this one.I LOVED IT!!",5
"Still controversial today, Wilde's study of a man's moral distintigration is both richly poetic and ultimately disturbing. The book even resists classification today. Is it part of the Decadence movement or the Symbolist movement?Or is it an experimental novel, fashioned perhaps as a psychological gothic study? More importantly, though, Wilde's creation poses the question: Can a book be poisonous? Gray succumbs to the ""evil"" influence of Huysmans' book A Rebours. As Wilde as written, ""there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. Books are well written or badly written."" Wilde may have created a well written book, but he also, albeit purposely, created a book when, viewed from its many horizons, can be seen as terrible moral study in the lesson Gray undergoes.",5
I've only just started reading the book but so far I've enjoying what I've read of it to this point.,5
"I quite enjoyed the sharp witty dialogue,particularily that of Lord Henry who was one of the most interesting and provocative characters I've come across in quite some time.",5
"First of all, it is free and it is a classic you cannot miss. Short lecture with a great story",5
"This is a kick-ass rock group! I heard them on the AllGirlRadio station on the internet, and loved them!!! It's good to hear some good old rock, especially from women! Being a huge Joan Jett fan, I really appreciate this group!",5
"This band is simply awesome. The vocals are hard without being overbearing and the music demands respect. Each track is just as rockin' as the last, there are no dull moments here.",5
"This is a wonderful resource for clinician's, especially those that may NOT be used to working with TBI, right CVA and the higher level dysfunctions. It has exercises, compensatory strategies for both the patient, and suggestions for the patient. I've used it for years.",5
"Until Death Do Us Parta is the first book I've read from this author and it was GREAT. I recommend to everyone who like romance, suspense and mistery. This is not your run-of-the mill romance, suspense story !!This fantastic, suspense packed story is one that I will be keeping in my favorites file. These well described and highly developed characters have such an emotional bond between them that it brought tears to my eyes many times while reading this tale! Readers will not want to put this book down.This story for me was one that I didn't want to put down and when I absolutely had to, it kept calling my name until I could get back to it. GJT Simpson has got himself a new fan with this captivating and enchanting book and I can't wait to read what else he has in store!!! Outstanding! *****",5
We love it! We saw it last year at the camp ground. I got it for my B-day and enjoy the simple use and small size. When there is not fire pit or fires are not allowed that's the winner!,5
"It works great,the only thing Idon't like is the cheesy fake log, it would much better with the fake logs that come with gas fireplaces.",5
I used this book for a graduate class on public finance. The price was right and all the students had access to the electronic copy. The book content was very good for our purposes and allowed me to discuss the topics without the need for an overly expensive text book.,5
"i bought these socks at first because they looked funny and was curious so i thought i would give it a try. It did take some time to get used to having my toes being separated, but after a while, i don't even want to take them off. It did get kind of embarrassing when i take my shoes off in front of people though. but overall, i do like these socks.",5
At first the socks feel a bit constricting but after 5 minutes you can't feel them at all. I just ran 5 miles and had no blisters or sore toes for the first time. I am buying two more pairs now :),5
"I wear these with my vibrams and love them - have never gotten a blister. I've also used them in a bunch of races, as much as 100 miles, and had great luck. However, if you're doing a race that's going to be really wet or have stream crossings, I would recommend getting one of the higher cut ones since the lowest cut one can fall down when it gets really wet, which is annoying and makes heel blisters more likely.",5
"I have only had these for a short time, but after a few hours of wearing them to get used to the extra material, I am really enjoying them. I use these socks not only when running, but for basketball and tennis too. Works great so far, and I am going to buy more of them.",5
"I wear these type socks and footlets for relief from one toe that has started going under the toe next to it. On my feet for hours and it gets painful. These are well made, keep toes straight (like when I was younger) and keep me going painfree. I wish this company made this style, little footlets that don't show with dress shoes.",5
"injinji Micro Toesocks are very well made. The material seems to very comfortable. They stay in place, without slipping down in my shoes",5
"I bought these socks for my Five Fingers, but ended up running a marathon in them. I was having bad blisters on the tops of my second and third toes after long runs (15+ miles) and gave them a shot. For the marathon, I also sprayed some second skin (I forget the brand) but afterwards I had no blisters anywhere. Very happy with these socks. (As an aside, I also own the lightweight version of these. Great for Five Fingers, too loose for regular shoes.)",5
"At first I hated these socks because I never wore toe socks and the only reason I bought them is because I bought me a pair of vibram toe shoes. After awhile I got use to it being between my toes and now I love them and are by far the most comfy socks, while second best. Asics are the best but these are better than any Nike socks.",5
"These socks were for my son, who runs lots of races. He was getting blisters on his toes, but with these socks, no more blisters. He wears them under high quality running shoes, and under minimalist shoes. He's very happy with the socks.",5
These socks are great. I bought them to wear with my Vibram Five Fingers. They are soft and fit nice and snug and don't bunch up and the heel doesn't ride down as I run. Great find!,5
"I bought these socks on a whim because I just purchased a pair of Vibram FiveFinger Bikila LS toe shoes. Love the shoes, but I am not wearing these socks with them because the shoes are skin tight without the socks. I have ended up wearing my injinji's with every other pair of shoes I own. I currently have 3 pairs of these socks and will be purchasing more very soon. I will never wear a regular pair of socks again. I am officially a toe-sock convert. They allow a greater range of motion and completely eliminate toe bunching caused by socks.",5
"Great toe socks, my sisters bf loves them. He wears them all the time with his toe shoes, and they are super soft.",5
"Finally some toe socks for guys withh big feet. These are wonderful and comfortable, will be getting more of these.",5
"very good product, excellent time and attention me dieron respuestas a mis preguntas and get my order in the time ordered",5
Item was Shipped fast and it was exactly what I expected and my son loved the socks thank you very much!,5
"I absolutely love these socks, they are the most comfortable socks I've ever worn in boots or cross trainers. I need about 10 more pair.",5
If you own Vibrams these are a must. Vibram sold toesocks are over priced. Injinji makes microfiber in all sizes compatible with Vibram socks and are more affordable. Especially since my Vibrams with shipping took me over 100 bones.-Sgt of Marines,5
"I have had a pair of vibram five fingers KSO treks for about two months. I love the shoes which recently started causing blisters in certain areas. I broke down and started buying these socks which have not disappointed. They have eliminated the foot odor in these leather shoes as well as provided a comfortable snug fit for me. Granted, all feet are different and I tend to have some long skinny toes. These stretched to fit comfortably. They seem to be made of quality material.I would not run around sock-footed in these since carpet will ultimately wear holes in them. So far I have machine washed them multiple times and they have retained their shape without stretching. These socks are great to use even if you do not have a pair of vibrams. They work well in regular shoes. I have even worn them in insulated boots.",5
"I bought these socks to wear with the Merrell barefoot model shoes and it was very conclusive. The toes feel great separated like this, it's a bit like not having socks at all. I was afraid to be cold but after walking for a while my feet were hot and at ease.",5
This DVD is for those of us who are not young gym bunnies. It's a good way to ease into yoga.,5
Got to me quick and timely. Used them to mount a 130/90-18 on a spoked rim with inner tube. Never came close to biting the tube. Enough length for leverage if you take small bites. Nice size to carry.,5
"first off, i love trains, the sound of rumbling trains in the night, anything to do with trains. ive always loved the idea of hopping freight trains. there aren't very many books on the subject. ive read hopping freight trains in america which is a great manual if you are planing on taking a ride. this book gave an inside view on what its like to live the tramp life. after reading this it made me want to ride the rails even more. great book.",5
"OK...here's the drill...a lot of semi-pro or pro musicians cringe at the thought of putting a Digitech ""anything"" in their signal chain. But recently, I went to a local venue, and heard this guy playing super transpearent lead guitar lines, while maintaing the sound of his single coil insturment, but it sounded like tubes being overdriven, all from a 15 watt amp. I snuck a peak at his modest pedal board....and there was a Badmonkey!This pedal took the place of a handmade pedal on my board that was 5 times the cost! YouTube has some great vid reviews. But this will be the best $49 you'll spend on a pedal desinged to maintain the integrity of you guitars unique sound, yet give you enough dirt/grind to feel like you're playing through a Narrow Panel Tweed at 10. This is NOT for Metal Heads...this is strictly old school, blues, country or jazz/fusion only. Combine it with a ZD or TS, and it's magic on a budget!DigiTech DBM Bad Monkey Overdrive Guitar Effects Pedal",5
"If you've ever even THOUGHT about going to work for the U.S. Government, BUY THIS BOOK!! Full of useful information that federal job hunters MUST have to succeed.",5
Louis Begley is able to convincingly write of survival as seen through the innocence and straightforwardness of a young Jewish boy. A boy whose life gradually becomes a web of lies and inward and outward loss. Loss which he will ultimately not be able to ever recover from. This is a short book with appeal to adults and young adults given the young protagonist and appropriate content.,5
"The best part for me is Part three of the book, it presents a realistic implementation of Battleship game using client server, it covers all the interesting aspects in a very clear and incremental manner.Chapter 18 is paricularly good, it starts from a very simple active object, explains how it works, then moves on to the pattern, also explains why he favors one approach over the other, the mistake he made etc.Part Three - Communications and Systems ProgrammingChapter 16 - Communications and Systems ProgrammingChapter 17 - The Transaction-oriented Games StackChapter 18 - Active ObjectsChapter 19 - Client-server FrameworkChapter 20 - The GSDP ServerChapter 21 - GDP ImplementationsChapter 22 - Full Battleships",5
The Eyewitness DK guides are beautiful books in their own right--you would enjoy reading them even if you didn't make the trip. The text is well organized and extensively illustrated with artwork and 3-D pictures of the major tourist attractions. The directions are excellent and they direct you to the important things to see at each location.A particularly helpful feature is a section with specific instructions on how to use Vienna's extensive public transportation system including a description of the various types of tickets and pictures of the ticket machines.This guide blows the competition out of the water.,5
"Alot of times i will have trouble getting into racing games due to 1 or 2 small things that make the game a drag... but this one i have beaten 3 times and still enjoy playiong it!!!!The Cars are excellent (i love the hearse), Physics and Damage are amazingly realistic.... very cool unlockable Videos. Tons of diffrent race modes, and a Very good soundtrack!!!The ONLY thing that i think is a little dissappointing is the fact that SOME of the event types are not playable in the Carreer mode (out of about 25 diffrent styles of events..only about 3 are NOT in the Career mode).I recomend you pick up this game.. if you like racing, and like Demolition derby style play... You will love this game Beyond words!!!!",5
it has demolition derby figure 8 trailer races oh lord when i buy this game im afraid to ask what other crazy events await me in this chaos and mayhem game,5
"This was one of the best mysteries I've listened to in a long time--I had the audio version which was well read. I liked the unexpected twists, and every time I thought I had it figures out, another twist would send me down a different path. Well done. I'm looking forward to more stories by this author!",5
this is such a great movie.. loved it.. would of seen it over and over in the theater if the prices werent so high... definatly a buyer..,5
I downloaded it on to my kindle and I enjoyed watching it instantly. No problems purchasing or downloading it. Amazon made it easy for me to purchase things like this movie for my kindle.,5
This movie was very good and the whole family enjoyed it.We can't wait for part 2.I would recommend this movie.,5
"This is by far the best movie of the series and for a first for me, my new very favorite movie. This movie stayed closer to the book then the others and I thought it was great!!Besides the actors, which I adore, the makeup artist was phenomenal!!Billy Burke is heavily under-rated; he was great!!The setting and backdrop was fantastic!!I think Bill Condon will be in very high demand because of his ability to stay true to the writer's work and give it wonderful vision. Very few other directors have this gift.If you have read and enjoyed the books, this movie will ring truer for you than the others.But I still like them too.",5
I have been trying to find somewhere to get Breaking dawn for a wonderful price. Finally after looking I found this one and I love it. It was in great shape. The shipping was fast as well.,5
"The movie was very close to the book, in the sense that the wedding, honeymoon, and birth were captured with a variety of emotions that the people watching the movie could feel those emotions. Also, the soundtrack was spectacular, in the honeymoon they used Turning Page by Sleeping At Last that if you read the lyrics you will be captivated even if you don't believe in true love.",5
I loved it and am really glad to add it my collection.I ordered another copy and will give it to myGreat grandaughter in college.,5
My granddaughter loves all things to do with the Twilight series. She said this movie is awesome and would highly recommend it.,5
"I love the series! They are great movies, I have watched them over and over again. Well worth buying them!",5
"Breaking Dawn is a story of two teens gradually growing and facing adult choices, decisions and consequences. Edward and Bella wed, and the adventure ends at a point midway in the book, at the moment she wakes as a vampire. Keep watching. There is a little bit more to the story.",5
"it was great to watch again, I remember watching it afew years ago and it's still as great as ever. I would recommend it to anyone to buy.",5
"You either like the movies or you don't. Of course, I do so I am very please with the product and the customer service.",5
It was in great conditions and it came very fast even a while month before Christmas.Very pleased with it.,5
Anyone who likes the Twilight Saga will like this one. It was beautifully portraid in movie form. And the ending was great!,5
"I am, as usual, very pleased with my order. It was delivered in a timely manner and in in excellent condition. If you like the serious I would recommend adding this one to your collection.",5
This movie was great I am a huge fan of The Twilight Saga and have watched this several times and can't wait for part 2.,5
"In the first place, this item was well packaged. It arrived on time and was in great condition.As far as the item itself is concerned, I love it! I made the mistake of reading the first book since one of my vices is vampire lore. The books were so well written, that I ended up viewing and later purchasing the DVDs in relation to each one. However, the books are still better because they provide a much richer story.",5
"Okay this has got to be the best movie in the twilight saga and it is far the best. The action is the greatest,It's great to see that Bella and Edward finally get married but theirs only one problem Bella gets pregnant and now she will have to make a life decision of what shes going to do because she has a lot to go through, Will she die or will she stay alive. This is the best movie from the twilight saga and it deserves five star's. I can't wait for Part 2 which will be coming out next November, But for now this is the best movie so far in the twilight saga =)",5
LOVE IT. TELL EVERYONE TO SEE IT I WATCH.I WATCH THIS MOVIE OVER AND OVER AGIGN THATS HOW MUCH I LOVE IT,5
"I now have all but the last movie in the series, and love this movie series, so I'm not complaining at all.",5
"While the first 3 Movies stayed somewhat close to the books, ""Breaking Dawn-Part 1"", has a lot of thing's that are different in it... I know that they can't put EVERYTHING from the book into the movie, but there were a few time's that I found myself thinking 'Why did theydo this/that???', 'How did they get from there to here???'Even with those thing's, it's still a GREAT Movie... One that you diffently want to see... I just hope they release it on DVD soon... I also can't wait to see -Part 2-, I think it's going to be sometime in July or around then...",5
My now 13 year old daughter loves it and it was just what she wanted to make her collection as complete as possible.,5
This is a part of the same movies my son wanted. Now all he needs is breaking dawn 2 he can't wait for it.Thank you so much.,5
This was gift to my daughter for Christmas. She was so excited to have received it. She is a huge Twilight fan. She loved it!!!,5
I am fan. Love Vampire movies anyway. creating a love story of such between a vampire and human and then to produce a child was great. again I loved it.,5
"I'm old enough to be all the actors mother, but still find the whole Twilight Saga charming. The acting is very good and Rob Pattenson is his usual sexy self, this is the first time he has to struggle at something without Bella at his side, but all works out well. If you love the other movies, you'll love this one too. The only thing was there were only a couple bruises, what's the big deal? For him to be so upset they could've marked her up a little more. The sex scenes were sweet and tastefully done, love it when he moans! But why did the other vampires stop hunting when she comes home pregnant? Just remember its a modern fairy tale and go with the flow and you'll enjoy this movie too.",5
My collection is almost complete. It was very hard finding the right dvd version that is similar to borders' twilight and new moon. It is what I thought it was. And what I wanted.,5
"Love this movie. My daughter got me watching them and I was hooked. Even if you didn't read the books, you can still enjoy the movies.",5
"Loved this movie!! The Twilight movies just progressively get better, and I live having the double DVD with all the special features!",5
"This was my favorite Twilight movie so far. I've got to say, I was a little nervous about this one. With a wedding, honeymoon, and a baby, I didn't think they would be able to fit all of that in a two hour movie. I am completely Team Jacob(Taylor Lautner) but, I also found myself liking Edward (Robert Patterson)in this one. I always thought he was cold-hearted. He showed emotion and he had a personally in this movie. I never saw that before. He was also a good husband. Not to big on having a baby, but he had good reasons. He came around in the end when he knew the baby wasn't a demon, and that's all that matters. It is rated PG13 and comes with Special Features.",5
"This movie is one of the best I have seen! When I went to the theater I was so excited. When I came out I was looking through every store to pre-order it. I would suggest this movie if you like Romance and Drama, and Baby Renesme. It was Ah-Mazing!!!!",5
I've never read the books so I wasn't a big fan going into Twilight but the movie did a great job of engaging you and anxious to see Part 2. Great bonus features too on the making of the movie. I would recommend buying it.,5
Love Twilight. Any gift I receive that is Twilight related is a winner in my book. Huge Fan! ! !,5
Awesome movie and at a great price of only .99. Thank you for the opportunity to rent the movie. now i am caught up on the series.,5
My daughters are hooked on the twilight series and love this DVD. It is awesome and in great codition. Thanks,5
Excellent. I have the complete series and this is an excellent movie. I thought it was neat it was filmed in Washington.,5
"By far this was the best Twilight movie. I loved it! I saw it twice. It was funny, sad and exciting. I believe it was true to the book. I would even have to go as far as to say it was better than the book. I thought the sex scene would be horrible because it was PG-13 ( and I am 34) but they did a great job at capturing what needed to be captured and did it in a tasteful way. Pattinson is adorable! Stewart did an outstanding job! I cant wait to get my DVD copy!",5
I bought this one to help complete my collection and to watch all of them prior to the release of the last movie in theatres. Love this series.,5
"I cannot wait for this to come out. I have all of the other movies and books. Also went to see them all in theaters. My fav movie was the first Twilight, but this one is close second. I don't see how their gonnna fit the rest of Breaking Dawn into one movie. But I can't wait to see!",5
"Saw the movie in the theater, but wanted the DVD to watch from time to time. Wife loves the music and got me hooked.",5
