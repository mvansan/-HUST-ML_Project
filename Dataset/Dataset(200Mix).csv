"The case was very nice for a week or two and then stretched so bad that my phones corners were constantly popping out of it. I had to pop the phone back into the case every time i took the phone out of my pocket. Also the more rubbery part of the case (the sides that stretched) yellowed a lot after just a couple of weeks of use. Could not return it to Amazon bc i didnt have the original box so I submitted a warranty claim on the Otterbox website. They asked for photos and said that my case might qualify for a replacement and i need to ship it back to them. They said that they couldn’t provide a shipping label but my shipping fee will be waived on their side. Liars. So i go and spend $30 on shipping it back, send them the receipt and they say they are not going to reimburse it now. Would not even give me a gift card for that amount. So i end up spending $80 on a bad quality product that i dont even have anymore. I ask them if they can at least send me a replacement in a different color so there is no yellowing problem to which they agree (they said they would make an “exception” for me). But then they ignore me for days. FedEx said that they received my package on Dec 9 but on Dec 19 Otterbox said that they dont have anything and they cannot track my package bc the tracking website didn’t work which of course it did. That was the last email I received from a human. On Dec 22 I received an automatically generated email that my package has been received (13 days after it actually arrived) and that was it. They have been ignoring my emails and not responding. $80 and a lot of my free time down the drain. I would not recommend doing business with them to anyone. I trusted their reputation and I should not have. This is the worst customer service experience i have ever had.",1
"This item looks good, the 2-in-1 separate filter line is useful, and installation was straightforward.Unfortunately after 18 months, the faucet started leaking from inside the metal housing. Even when the faucet was turned off, water would leak slowly from inside the housing, down the line, and dripped over a few days. It ended up ruining my cabinet and the drywall on the ceiling of the floor below.The manufacturer, Kraus, claims a ""lifetime limited warranty"", but within the warranty text, the faucet hardware is only covered from defects for 1 year and 5 years, with more limits. After 1 year, they will also charge you for shipping the defective item back to them.I understand that I should have read the warranty terms in more detail before purchasing the item. However, I didn't expect a kitchen faucet to fail within such a short time frame, given how expensive it was. I also take issue with companies that try extract shipping fees from their customers when their products are defective and under warranty.Since I wasn't interested in paying for shipping to have a defective item repaired, and no longer trusted the manufacturer, I asked about return options. The agent condescendingly answered, ""honey, we're the manufacturer, you'll have to call Amazon about that"" and abruptly ended the conversation.I understand that defective items will occur from time to time. However, I do expect that companies stand by their products and provide support for their customers when it happens. Unfortunately Kraus is not one of those companies and I had to go through Amazon to get help with this situation.I'm sure most people who have bought this product have a faucet that's working fine. However, in the off chance that you get a defective unit, just know that Kraus will not be helpful. You're better off buying from another company for the same price range.",1
The handles fell off the replacements,1
It’s not like the pictures. No metal thing to hang it on. Looks homemade.,1
"These candles were lovely until one totally died even after battery replacement. It won't work at all. These are way too expensive to only last 4 months. I turn them on about 3 times/week for an hour, not every day. Disappointing!",1
"Dollar stores have a better quality then this product, and 10 times cheaper.",1
Keyboard is cheap looks like a disco . Slow,1
POST beeps indicating corrupt bios. Returning.,1
"First boot, saw the windows logo, then BSOD. Couldn't get it to recover as it didn't have a recovery image installed. Couldn't boot safe mode, error stating couldn't install windows in safe mode. BSOD after BSOD after BSOD. Additionally, Amazon customer service was lacking in this experience.Returned for refund. Gotta love the new 30 days to refund on higher priced items like this. Maybe I can order one next month.",1
"ive had this pc for a good 3 and a half years already bout it to play games, but after realizing the hardware was 10+ years old i couldnt play nothing on it so i just used it for school work and ext. Out of the 3 and half years ive had it most of the time ive had it it was either not working at asurion getting fixed or on and not even being used cause itll crash every opportunity it gets. I really wished i refunded when i had the chance but i was to ignorant, after these 3 years ive seen plenty of videos on these pc scams and ext and you can get this exact same computer for a quarter of its price. dont get scammed just because it looks good and has LED lights this computer is literally useless. For 500$ you can find a computer wayy more advanced than this one and last way longer. im truly upset on this purchase its the worst of my life (i just got done paying it off)",1
"Several times it shut down with hardware erro4s and is not compatible with Windows 11. And I constantly have to unplug the keyboard and the mouse and plug them back in to get them to work. I have to do the same with my camera. The box looks great but what a crappy computer it is slower than DialUp they give you a little USB to plug into the computer to have Wi-Fi. It’s the same size as the USB square that comes out of your wireless mouse. What an awful experience from the very first week I bought this computer to the last right now. It is completely shut down I’m in the middle of a business everything I have is on this computer on the cloud to return which I don’t have access now , it’s just horrible . Look at the second picture behind my computer, you’ll notice that the only things that are plugged in are the monitors, keyboard and mouse. And if you look at the first picture, you’ll notice the errors card via storage device, such as an external USB drive, which we don’t have faulty hardware such as a hard drive or CD ROM, which apparently we do now just awful.",1
This computer was marketed as a new gaming computer and never worked at a level for gaming. After a year of trying to make it work we brought it to a professional and they said the components were 5-6 years old and we were better of buying a different computer vs trying to update/fix this one. Thanks for making a kids dream Christmas gift a complete lemon.,1
"This computer is garbage! Parts are from 2011. You'll spend more than what u bought it for to upgrade it to work for ur games! Do urself a favour, save ur money & DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER!",1
"I want a full refund of my money you can’t even use the internet without it lagging, can’t even load fortnite let alone play it got into one match with 4 fps with everything to the lowest I will not stop emailing until you have refunded me",1
"This PC was great to look at, and that's about it. The Wifi was terrible/damaged idk. We even used a third party wifi adapter and it was still awful. We have a 330mbs internet and all my other devices ran fast, so that wasn't the problem. Afterwards, it didn't detect my monitor. I ran it for a couple of minutes and nothing. It sounds like a jet engine while it's running as well. Over all, this PC is not worth the headache I went through. Save your money and look for another option.",1
"The monitor support bar didn't fit .. then once we rigged something together and set it up it kept restarting, wouldn't get past initial set up. DO BETTER !!!",1
The media could not be loaded. The pc and the monitor would not connect at all. The monitor would flash on and say no signal then turn off. The desktop itself from the moment of turning it on made that very loud motor boat sound. The advertised keyboard and mouse were not included a standard set was.I called support who advised they would try and connect me with a IT Person and that took over 30 mins. IT kept telling me to unplug it and plug it back in. Return support was not helpful either please don’t waste time or money on this!,1
Fine for the first few times that it was being used but now is laggy or completely shuts down. Only purchased in August of 2023 and it's now January 2024 so only had it for less than 5 months and it isn't even used heavily. Disappointing.,1
"product is very very bad packaged , LED not working with a very very very small electricity output cable . i literally had to get a power source 5CM beside it to make it fit and still LED not working",1
"This console was a brick the day it was released. As usual, Microsoft is years behind its competitors. I don’t even know why I was stupid enough to purchase one. The biggest issue is that in order to play games you purchased, you must constantly update them. That’s ridiculous. Why? It was working just fine. The other issue is that it continues to take up more and more space. I regret few things in life, but purchasing this junk has to be on the top. Save yourself some headache and buy a different system.",1
"I bought this ”refurbished” console in July, and it stopped turning on in November. This was sold as an “Amazon Refurbished” console. The customer support at Amazon told me they wouldn’t replace it, and they wouldn’t take a return on it. The “warranty is for 90 days,” and the console turned into a brick at 120 days, so there’s nothing that Amazon will do to stand behind their product. They told me to contact Microsoft for help. The warranty that Microsoft gives is from the original purchase date of the console. In my case the “Microsoft warranty” ended on Nov. 21st, and the console quit working on Nov. 25th. So lucky me the only thing I can do is pay Microsoft an additional $300 to get this console replaced. So because I’m one month outside of 90 days and 4 days past a warranty that started before I even owned the console I now own a $450 paper weight. And if I want the company to fix or replace it I get to own what will be a $750 console. All because I trusted Amazon to sell a working “refurbished” console.",1
I thought I’d give this a go seeing as it was Microsoft refurbished. Looked brand new when opened. Everything was great. Then while installing games and watching a movie it locked up. I rebooted and it would lock up then shut off. I reset it several times. Same issue. Safe to say the SSD failed. Spend the few extra dollars and buy new. Waste of time and money.,1
"Picked the referbished unit for the savings. Worth the price. Came with the full warranty. Controller looks new. Was the price of a used one on the local buy and sells, and has warranty. A no lose situation.Update, controller drift after 40 days. Amazon will not accept return and Microsoft will not warranty. DO NOT PURCHASE****",1
"I bought this as a gift and unfortunately was left extremely disappointed. The controller didn’t work, the console freezes during game play with almost every single game we tried and then one week later it will not turn on. Well, it turns on, but nothing will display on the TV other than the Xbox logo. Extremely disappointing and embarrassing given it was a gift. Seems that buying a new one may be worth the money if this is the best alternative. Returning asap and will be using the money toward a new console from a legitimate seller.",1
Product failed on second day. Returned!,1
"Package arrived early, which was nice, console turned on and worked fine, until it came to reading the discs. The console did not work any further than the home screen, super disappointing. And upon trying to clean the disc scanner, the console was customized so there is no access to this point of the hardware; a part allowing you to go further is missing and replaced with a custom piece that won’t move, meaning if it is broken, its broken. There’s no hope in repairing it yourself. Was looking forward to it but was let down",1
I understand this item was not going to be brand new. That said the quality is very poor. Rusted insides not refurbished at all. Does not power on. Oveall disappointed that they would even take someones money and be ok with sending this out.,1
"This phone was not usable on Straight Talk Wireless. Straight Talk informed me that the phone was locked and could not be used on their service until it was unlocked. This phone is listed as unlocked and usable on any service. I contacted Samsung because these are new phones, they had me do a factory reset on the phone and said that would fix the issue. This did nothing to fix the problem.",1
"UPDATE: After having this phone for months I have to say it's the biggest POS that I've ever had!! More glitches than I could list. I took 4 stars away because I'm so angry at all the glitches. Now I'm going to go back to my A10E, at least that was reliable!!I decided to wait to write a review because I was on the fence about keeping it or not. My previous phone was a Samsung A10E which is not a very heavy phone. The A15 is considerably heavier which I am (still) not very comfortable with. Comparing the 2 phones as far as memory is concerned is markedly different. The A10E has 32 gigs of internal memory. The A15 has 128 gigs of internal memory. Considering that I have alot of pics on my phone with several different albums, this makes the A15 a better product. The battery life is quite good. The appearance is beautiful. I purchased the light blue phone. I have a clear cover on my phone. This is my 4th Samsung cell phone. Samsung never disappoints with quality, durability and performance. I love the Samsung Smart Switch which makes moving your data from one phone to another fast and super easy. They don't provide a SIM card or micro SD card so you need to make sure to move your cards into your new phone. The software is similar to previous Samsung phone with a few tweaks. For example, to get a screen shot for the A15 you need to press both power and volume down button simultaneously. What makes the A15 different from any of my previous Samsungs is with the A15 you have to press each twice. There is a feature that would put a floating icon on your screen and open it and tap screenshot then you will get your screenshot. Now, what sold me on the A15 is a neat feature where, upon your approval, they will block all spam/scam phone calls. So no more annoying spam/scam calls!! It's a neat feature!! Like I said, I love Samsung phones!!",1
"How many apps do you think you have on your phone? 40? 50? how about your phone from 2 or 3 years ago? 15-20 tops? LOL ah, yes the days when we got excited to get a few free apps or games on our new phones... alas those days are OVER bro! get you a variation of the moto g device family. Out of the box, she is pretty amazing. I didn't have a single complaint really. Super fast, tons of storage, great camera, new updated apps, lots of customizing, etc. JUST WONDERFUL. After a few months it happened, the dreaded update in April I think it was, maybe March, I now have 400+ apps. (I will attach a pic, it shows 399, there have been about 30-40 more that have trickled in since the initial dump, which took about 5-7 days to finish up... and 75-80% are ""system apps"" (bloatware from any and every carrier in fact.... ALL. OF. THEM.) For example, a bluetooth app for t-mobile, & verizon, & sprint, & metro, && cricket. Before you say, ""just uninstall them and move on!"" - I did. I have. I've factory reset twice and they're just BUILT INTO THE phones disk memory. There simply is no ""delete"" them. Some of them, as duplicatory as they are, messing around with them can still brick up your jawn within a few clicks... and before you even start, you are not a dev... so chill, I mean neither am I... but you just stay out of that menu, that app, and that folder. Really, who knows why they name everything in tech sketchy stuff like ""com.sys.IM-WATCHING-YOU-PAM.000"" and ""<%real/secret/23-LISTENER999>... but anyways... JUST PROMISE ME, YOU WON'T GET INTO THAT APP, OR FOLDER.... okay?So Motorola should reimburse me for having to put myself through IT school to teach myself to operate on this phones guts and remove all these garbage apps manually to create the phone I thought I purchased. All you can do is force stop and disable them. Buuut I still feel like they are gathering data, bc, why wound't they be. Its not just this model either, my partner has the moto g stylus 5g and its even worse on theirs. the play store basically never gets a break from constant updates (and then theres the transferring of precious data to the mother ship)yeaaaa we also had to upgrade our home internet plan and router because of all this. We couldn't both use the wifi at the same time doing anything at all. it was crazy. allllllso the apps are gathering intense amounts of data and ALL WANT crazy permissions that have nothing to do with the app itself. like the calculator wants camera permissions... nuts. The sheer number of apps that require making system changes or having total device control... it was too much. I would almost ask for a refund, but from what I see these days most phones are leaning that direction, making money off our god given ones and zeros.... and then still try and look at us in the eyes while they sputter out the retail price of the next generation of your favorite device. can't even hold it down on a free case or something..THEN - - when you finally get a break from force quitting and removing permissions that, somehow keep TURNING BACK on... you might have a few minutes to enjoy a quick photoshoot. NOPE. the camera app it comes with stinks, it just soooo basic.. so then you think, oh, i'll download a cool camera app off play store... NOPE. theres a fricking governor on the camera. That makes it so NO 3rd party camera app will get full usage of ALL THE MEGA PIXELS YOU PAID YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY FOR (48 megs to be precise, which is overkill, but still, you will be lucky to get to use 10 or 12 MP!!)Seriously. And JUST as google starts conveniently implementing the awesome 2 step verification, and authentication keys.... JUST in time for you to have to answer to your wife about why you don't have as much info in your google takeout as she does... yikes... oh and squeeze on some more of that exact same conversation about your FB activity as well.. yaaaaay.So, let me get this straight... I now have to REMEMBER ALL MY UNIQUE PASSWORDS && double log in, && verify 3 ways, all to check a notification thats just a promotional email about the new apps GEWG will put out next week. AND then FINALLY the google security come forward to say they don't trust my log in (bc i've got a VPN) - - - (from guess who - G1 - duh!) and they really cant tell the difference between MY REAL actual login on my trusted device from what it must assume is a HAKKr logging in 3 states away. . . . . . E.V.E.R.Y. LOG - INNNN!at this point i am thinking about a jitterbug and some stress eating of sour worms to relax.but yeah the phones cool, other than that.",1
"This was my 2x trying Amazon Renewed. This time I purchased the LAST stated available 2023 described as ""In OEM box, Box shows wear from opening"". The Moto Razor Flip phone was described as ""Like new"". Immediately upon arrival w/o even opening the box I knew it was wrong as the package was far too light. I opened it & there was a Moto Razor w/obvious discoloration on the case from use + a CHIP in the bottom screen. Packaging was similar to a top end Samsung I ordered from Amazon Renewed & fulfilled by a 3rd Party in FL 2 years ago. I saved due to credit only $20 @ checkout over a NEW One. WORSE there's NO WAY to return this immediately (There' are 2 Amazon Return 2 locations within 2-5 minutes of my house. Just came back from one & CS stated ""I've never seen this"")). Instead Amazon MAY notify me when they'll ONLY pickup from my house in 3 days.I had this EXACT same problem with a $700+ Laptop that was supposed to be Brand New. I'm beyond a coder or tech guy & ran a battery cycle count software on that as the battery lasted 2 hours less than advertised. It was obviously a RETURN, re-sold as NEW, unless Compaq sells Laptops w/over 200 battery cycles already on them. Same thing w/2 PB's & a CH Android Tablet which still had the previous User's name & account information installed. Seriously, WHO is doing QC? I'll NEVER use Renewed again. Period. Even when you buy a NEW item it's 50/50 now you'll get someone else's return sold as New! eBay here I come again. Worst thing this was supposed to be a gift. OBVIOUS Screen CHIP really ticks me off. Since 2022 I'm now 2 for 8+ on purchases of tech devices. Buy with caution!",1
The system worked well for a few days .Then multiple issues launching any game arose.All games were bought new .Very aggravating.Not sure what to do now .I guess I just threw away money for a game console that barely works .Hope other people have better luck .Take care .,1
"Ever since I got this thing it’s been a source of frustration. It picks and chooses what games it allows me to play. Whenever I put a disk in it won’t read it, it’ll say open tray as of there isn’t even a dick inside. I have to open and close the tray 5+ times to get it to work. Sometimes it doesn’t. Some games it won’t play at all. I have a feeling that whoever inspected this thing before resale just looked it over and said “looks fine to me” and pushed it down the line. Piece of junk",1
"Not sure if I received a defective batch, but this set was horrible. All the “slimes” were sticky like glue and watery. Not useable. Waste of money.",1
"Well where do I begin? The tray door wasn't opening, handled that. It's not playing any of the games at all. This game system specifically said in good condition not seeing that at all. It's not even reading any of the games at all. So basically I just wasted $367 so I definitely feel like I have been scammed. This is so ridiculous. Ordered through Amazon I thought was a reliable place. Never had any problems before through them. So I figured why not? Well this is the absolute last time I'll be ordering anything that's refurbished or used. This is pure junk Xbox 360. Wasted my money and time. So thank you for that.....I hope this helps the next buyer plz beware of the scams.",1

"The media could not be loaded. Ok, I’m so confused. I didn’t open this for a couple weeks after getting it while I was finishing my last bottle. The seal on the bottle was intact. Unfortunately now I’m outside of my window to return.This was the worst experience ever. At first it was bright purple, for a few days. But even while purple… it felt clumpy and silicone-like.

It just breaks into smaller chunks and won’t stick to your teeth.I included a video of how it has turned brown and continues to stay that way no matter how much I pump out of it… looks like it’s oxidized?

I also didn't realize until I READ on the product info itself that the effects you might get if you're lucky will be for ""that day only""... purple cancels out yellow or something like that. This is a gimmick and was a complete and total waste of my good money. Can I get my money back? Please, I bought 2 bottles. I can send them both back one unopened.",1
The purple toothpaste does not dissolve (lather up). Good fall into sink from mouth while brushing.The purple color makes it appear whiter for a few moments only. Used for about 2 weeks. Waste,1
Don’t buy this buy Mint InstantPurple Color Corrector with nHAp. I haven’t bleached my teeth in a year since using that. I tried this to save money big mistake. This doesn’t even bring out the white at nothing. Plus the dispenser pull gadget inside became unhooked so it doesn’t work I have to shake the paste out after four days. Pure garbage.,1
I tried this product and can confirm that it does not preform as advertised. Day to day use did nothing to help improve the look of my teeth.If anyone has had any experience that was better than mine then great for you.,1
This product rendered useless as the product doesn’t pump out and there was no straw in the pump like most purple teeth whitening products in this category.,1
An explosion of toothpaste from every crevice but the one intended,1
It’s either very loose or just doesn’t fit. Trash.,1
I tried this product hoping it would do what it says. But I didn't notice any change at all. This was a waste of my money.,1
Received the tube- it felt liquid when I picked it up to use- so I shook it quite a bit. Opened a bunch of liquid squinted out everywhere. put cap back on and shock it- get a little bit of pasty white material like toothpaste. Has been ongoing issue- tube usually only squirts liquid so it does not stick to toothbrush. Can't return it. Waste of Money. Going to make m y own!,1
"This was our favorite toothpaste. Long lasting clean feeling and nice minty gel flavor. Since crest added the tarter protection (in very small print), the toothpaste is watery, no gel minty taste and doesn't clean as it did before. I bought Colgate for the first time ever. Just not the same.",1

"I was only able to use this product once and then it stopped working. It was great the one time I used it as it helped flush out my ear as I had an ear infection. I have charged it, the light turns from red to green and when I go to use it, it doesn't turn on.",1
"I purched this item along with some of the Pink Stuff, and did not use the brush before my return date expired. When I loaded the batteries it failed to turn on. OK, Pionk Stuff produce is good, so I order a second brush and when it arrived the packaging was damaged, but I tired it anyway just to see if this one worked. Same issue - unit would not start. Changed the batteries and it still would not start. Sending the 2nd one back for a replacement and will see how that works out. If it doesn't start I will just return it and look for another option. Obviously the manufacturing quality control is missing...",1
"I have used the attachment specifically to clean dirty grout in my tile floors and that was barely works. It comes with a lot of attachments for other types of cleaning I haven't tried them yet, but feels cheap...",1

"The product was good in concept, however, the head of the product keeps coming unscrewed from the pole, no matter how hard I tighten it. It doesn't get in the grooves very well. Seems like it would be great for someone it just need minor surface dust removed and does it on a very regular basis. But built up dust and dirt only gets moved around. Sad I spent the money in it. 😒",1
This product is AWFUL! It DOES NOT PEEL OFF easily or in one piece. I tried it last week and followed the instructions. It took my 45 minutes to peel tiny little pieces off before I just got in the shower to wash it all off. Last night I decided to give a second chance and left it on much longer this time allowing it to set. SAME issue. I was smarter this time though and did not spend all that time picking at it. It also made my skin much more irritated.,1

These do not work at all! I wish I did not have to give them any stars! I need anywhere between a .5 to 1.25 reader depending on whether I’m wearing my contacts or not so I was so excited to try these. I put them on and could not read ANYTHING! They were so blurry. I kept them on for a bit to see if they’d adjust and they never changed at all. They are going back and I am leaving this review so no else wastes their time or money on these.,1
"These are cheap, I guess you get what you pay for. They fit over glasses and do provide a view while laying flat. However it is very uncomfortable on your face and disorienting because of how the reflection is displayed, and I don't know if I just received a bad pair but the lenses were scratched. Also, they can't be returned, I don't know if there's a better option but this pair is not a good one.",1
"Too heavy to use,not good for Using laptop. It adds extra pain in your reading during lying in bed.",1
My lens fell out. Within my first minute of having it. The lens just fell out.,1
I got these for reading and they were so insanely heavy they caused a headache right away. I returned them.,1
We followed the instructions but this does not stick on with water as promised. Then when we went to return them we dicovered that the return window was only a month — since we weren’t going on vacation until next week we didn’t try putting them in and it expired by a week. :(,1
Feel cheaply made and a little heavy. Difficult to use if you wear glasses already. Have to lie way back or hold book way down at an odd angle to use well.,1
Poor quality didn’t expect much but didn’t expect this cheap. Like something you’d win at skee ball!,1
"The picture represents the glasses as is. i.e. The Bifocal piece is just that, a glued on bifocal. Too small. The sunglasses were very light and flimsy. Would not recommend.",1
I ordered these to better able to see my instruments while riding my motorcycle. They are hard for me to see anything through top or bottom. Not a good choice for me.,1
"The description of this product says ""Fits most glasses."" ON WHAT PLANET???Total waste of money.",1
"I have narrow eyeglasses and these sit in the top third of those lenses. They are basically unusable. The picture online doesn't show a correct image. I would guess it was placed with a distortion. It doesn't show how really narrow, top to bottom, these clip-ons really are. I don't know what to do with them. I guess I'm just out the money.",1
Make sure you know your range. I needed a higher range than what was advertised.,1
"Hinges break in two weeks ,they are very weak",1
Love the thought of the multi vision however the plastic lenses that I received were foggy and barely useful. It’s unfortunate as I did purchase a pair locally and had I not lost them… they were clear and functional.,1
It's a great item it's just that I can't use it with the lens scratched.,1
I don’t write reviews typically but these were pretty bad. Besides being scratched on one lense they were very poor quality. I paid much more than I usually do for a cheap pair of reading glasses and they were comically bad. Creaking plastic frames that were not angled correctly (too wide) when open so that I had to bring them back in to meet my head. Loose lenses that were not fit well to the frame. Not asking for much but for around $25 I expected them to at least be usable. Also suspect I’m not the first to return this pair.,1
"First it arrived much later than expected. It was just packed in a clear plastic bag, no cover at all. Then I went to open the arms to try them on and the hinge broke. Very disappointed. Had wanted to have a retro looking pair of reading glasses, I guess it wasn’t meant to be.",1
I bought two pairs and both broke from normal wear.No return option.Waste of money.Bad product!,1
Broke within a couple weeks of light use. Disposable quality.,1
"I bought these again because the side ear pieces stretched and I needed a new pair. Its been less than a year, and I ordered these again and the quality of the glass is horrible. DISTORTED! When I look down it makes me feel like Im 2 ft from the ground and I am not a toddler. Something really wrong with these.",1
Sorry but they don't work.,1
"The stems are somewhat short and the lens frame is a bit delicate (not surprising given the website photos and the fact that their wireframes), but the glasses are nice and lightweight. Unfortunately, the magnifying strength of the lens is a bit weak. I ordered a 2.0 lens and received them labelled at 2.0, but they seem closer to a 1.75, meaning they're a bit soft in terms of focus.",1
Disliked seeing fuzzy put over prescription glasses for the computer @ work I can see clear,1
"They do have lights. They are cute. But I got a book out in bed, which is why I wanted these, and put on these glasses to aide. I had to turn on light from iPhone to see the words. Hugely disappointed.",1
The attachment of the temple hinges is defective. I was replacing a broken pair I had for several years on which the hinges fit properly. Both replacement pairs have the same problem. I feel that these will break in a short period of time.I would recommend not ordering these glasses.,1
"I didn't like the glasses because it seems like the lens are inserted upside down! It is very difficult to see, I turned the glasses upside down on my face and now I can see close up!",1
The lenses and price on these glasses are awesome BUT I will not recommend as the frames break very easily when cleaning and I went through both pairs in 2 months so with that said I will never buy these again.,1
"Cheap packaging, arrived with right lens off",1
Avoid. The tag on the glasses marked them as defective store seconds. The lenses were scratched. To return them Amazon wants me to drive to a store many miles away.,1
"Worst readers that I have ever owned. Cheap frames designed to fit Shrek's head, so they fall off normal sized head, and optical quality is terrible. Don't waste your money.",1
"I'm not that gentle with eyewear, so should avoid plastic frames. Temple hinge broke off the rim.",1
These glasses are supposed to be adjusted for the user’s vision. The frames and lenses were cheaply made and I could not adjust them to improve my vision. Sent them back. Would not recommend anyone to purchase these glasses.,1
Do not waste your time and money on this expensive gimmick. IT'S WORTHLESS!!!,1
They're so poorly made it probably cost them less than $1 to make them. And look what they're selling them for! And they don't even work. Junk! Junk,1
"Not useful per any one need more 1.5 and only small face can use ,,,, very bad quality",1
"This is a self-published book, and if you want to know why--read a few paragraphs! Those 5 star reviews must have been written by Ms. Haddon's family and friends--or perhaps, by herself! I can't imagine anyone reading the whole thing--I spent an evening with the book and a friend and we were in hysterics reading bits and pieces of it to one another. It is most definitely bad enough to be entered into some kind of a ""worst book"" contest. I can't believe Amazon even sells this kind of thing. Maybe I can offer them my 8th grade term paper on ""To Kill a Mockingbird""--a book I am quite sure Ms. Haddon never heard of. Anyway, unless you are in a mood to send a book to someone as a joke---stay far, far away from this one!",1
"A complete waste of time. Typographical errors, poor grammar, and a totally pathetic plot add up to absolutely nothing. I'm embarrassed for this author and very disappointed I actually paid for this book.",1
"I guess you have to be a romance novel lover for this one, and not a very discerning one. All others beware! It is absolute drivel. I figured I was in trouble when a typo is prominently featured on the back cover, but the first page of the book removed all doubt. Wait - maybe I'm missing the point. A quick re-read of the beginning now makes it clear. This has to be an intentional churning of over-heated prose for satiric purposes. Phew, so glad I didn't waste $10.95 after all.",1
"I feel I have to write to keep others from wasting their money. This book seems to have been written by a 7th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age! As another reviewer points out, there is a misspelling on the cover, and I believe there is at least one per chapter. For example, it was mentioned twice that she had a ""lean"" on her house. I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot, that I decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling. Please don't waste your money. I too, believe that the good reviews must have been written by the author's relatives. I will not put much faith in the reviews from now on!",1
"Rather than scratches and insect droppings, this one has random pixelations combined with muddy light and vague image resolution. Probably the cue should have been the packaging is straight out of your street corner bootleg dealer.If you've ever seen a reasonably good condition film copy, you know the defining visuals of his film are the crystal clear lighting contrasts in black and white. The surrounding countryside and 'old home' scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright, clear, and immediate.Here everything is dull, dark, and clouded. Or, if you remember the timbre and enunciation of Captain's commands, so are the visuals.After that, it is hard to believe this award winning, critically acclaimed film's best presentation is on YOUTUBE. Somewhere ""out there"" is a DVD that comes up to the standard of a 16mm public library reel.Just none of them appear to be on Amazon.",1
"I bought this charger in Jul 2003 and it worked OK for a while. The design is nice and convenient. However, after about a year, the batteries would not hold a charge. Might as well just get alkaline disposables, or look elsewhere for a charger that comes with batteries that have better staying power.",1
"The plot is so ridiculous, I have to wonder if they even read the script before making this film. The mountain lion breaks out of his trailer - and the cars behind don't notice? The mountain lion is captured - and put in a jail cell? Get real! Utterly, completely stupid.",1
"If you have even casually looked into applying to law school, have already read everything there is in this book, do not waste your money, seriously!!",1
"It clearly says on line this will work on a Mac OS system. The disk comes and it does not, only Windows . Do Not order this if you have a Mac!!!!!!!",1
"I bought this for my wife for her birthday,and had toreturn it because the DVD palyer would not work. I returned it and got a repalcement, which once again the DVD player failed to work! It is a piece of junk.",1
"If you want to listen to El Duke , then it is better if you have access to his shower,this is not him, it is a gimmick,very well orchestrated.",1
"The screen arrived in a cardboard box that was pretty beat up. The screen itself is very lightweight, very cheesy looking. The ""finish"" was worn across the entire top of the screen. I knew this wasn't solid brass, but I expected something that at least looked decent from a distance for the price I paid.",1
"I ordered this DVD and received a substitute I never received the DVD I ordered from Importcds (the Vendor). I contacted them and did not recieve any feedback. I can't rate a DVD I have never seen. I didn't bother to send it back because it would have cost me more that I orginally paid for it. In the future I will watch for the name of the person and/or persons I am buying from. I thought they were a good company. I understand a simple mistake but, to not get a response at all is not good businees sense. I spend hundreds of dollars a month on Amazon.com building my DVD collection. I guess I will be more careful in the future.",1
This book drew air pretty bad. I have no idea why someone would waste their time writing it. Boy did it draw air. Do not read this book.,1
"I ordered the cake topper June 27, 2010. I was given an estimated shipping date of July 1-7, 2010. Those dates came & went with no cake topper. I contacted the seller twice with no response. I filed a claim with Amazon. I did end up receiving a cake topper on July 16, 2010; however, it's not even the one I ordered! The seller did refund my money, but has never contacted me or apologized for the mishap. I will never buy anything from the seller again. I looked at the seller's feedback & I'm not the only person they have done wrong, so buyer beware!!",1
"I am disappointed in its performance. It seems underpowered and is constantly trying to read CDs, half the time unsuccessfully. I am going to try to return it to Amazon.",1
"I did not know this was the audio cd of the game, I thought it could be used on the playstation. Maybe the other guys are from the US or somewhere where it is actually easy to get the game,and play it,but this was all in japanese and was not compatible with my machine. I am deeply disappointed as i love the arcade game, but the Dance stage euromix (Dance Dance Revolution equivalent) is lacking in decent tracks, many are jungle-y and are difficult to dance to them. Also, most of these tracks are unheard of here and are therefore not very enjoyable. However, my favourite are Keep on moving, make a Jam, and Video Killed the Radio star. But it gets a bit pedantic if you keep playing on these tracks. If anyone is in the same situation as I am, or those of you who are lucky enough the play on the newest version, can you please let me know where I can order one? I am in dance deprivation/boredom!",1

This book vaguely breezed across history and went into various types of timber structures. The mortise and tenon joints that were illustrated were fascinating but not practical for a home builder.,1
This product smells when you open the package and it appears one of the gel cushions leaks so I spent $10 and havent worn then. I wouldnt buy this product again. Dont waste your money on something you may not be able to use.,1
"I first tried buying this tape from a Marketplace seller. I sent it back because the tape quality was poor and the packaging looked unprofessional. After returning it I bought one from Amazon proper and . . . it was the same quality tape and the same packaging. Since I'm now sure this is not a bootleg tape, all I can say is . . . some videos are better than others.",1
"I should have read the prior reviews of this record before buying it. Although it appears to be a collection of new wave singles from the 80s, these are just cover versions sung by the ""Starlite Singers"". The description of the record says that it is by ""various artists"" implying that they are by the original artists, but this is not true. Total garbage. The one bright spot is that I got a prompt refund when I returned it.",1
"This is one of those cheesy compilations where they find session bands and similar sounding artists to sing the songs. These are NOT ORIGINAL SONGS BY THE ARTISTS. If you loved K-TEL CD's and don't care about hearing the artists originals, and don't care about cheap sounding synthesizers playing the music or that fact that some of the vocalists are pretty bad, then you might like this cd. But if you are a fan of the 80's and the amazing music it produced, then buy other collections and don't waste your money on this schlock!!!!",1
Bought this camera for Christmas. Had her open it first so she could film the nights party & NO TAPES ARE INCLUDED! Of course all stores are closed Christmas day so the thing is USELESS until the day after. Shame on Sony. How much would a tape included in the packace cost them ? Not included Battery chargers are ....,1
"If you purchase this data cable, you need to know that you will receive no real directions or information regarding what to check if nothing works. As directed, I downloaded all of the files from the SE site (70MB on dial up!), and then downloaded all of the user guides. Everything seemed to install ok, but nothing would make my phone be recognized. After that I scoured the SE site for troubleshooting info on their branded cable-in the hope that something would help me figure out the problem. After 2 full days of beating my head against the wall, I finally threw the cable and the useless CD that came with it in the trash.If I had used my brain I would have paid the extra $$ for a SE branded cable and software (and the support that comes along with that). I now have the real deal (SE data cable and software), and guess what? Yep, installation was a breeze and it works beautifully. You really do get what you pay for.",1

"Molly Myers, in her review of ""My Name is Rachel Corrie,"" describes the ISM as ""an organization dedicated to non-violence.""

You get what you pay for. This pillow is stiff and smelled like drying paint for 4 days. I thought I was getting a non name brand version of the Temperpedic pillow. I bought the real pillow for my mother years ago and paid many times the price. This thing doesn't even come close.,1
"The pillow I received is nothing like the one in the picture. The pillow that I received is approx half the size (in thickness) as the one I received. I am not happy with the seller (Moshelle's). I will never purchase from this company ever again. I am currently deployed Military and I feel that this company is very disrespectful and does not show it's Military members the proper courtesy when dealing with such issues. Do not buy this pillow, you will not be satisfied.",1

It worked about 40% of the time when I was standing less than two feet from the outlet. When I moved eight to ten feet away it worked about 5% of the. I would not recommend it.,1
"I never write reviews but I just felt compelled after I saw this video. It's 70% listening to parents and kids think about Thomas and maybe 30% Thomas related. What is worse is that you have to fast forward through a bunch of the rambling in order to see what amounts to a 5 minute story. And, there is only one song in the ""Sing A Long"". I really liked Thomas stories after watching them on PBS with my daughter. Next time, I will try to find those stories on video. They actually last about 15 minutes and do not involve mindless prattle from people I don't know.",1
"Unless I missed something, there are only one or two actual episodes on this DVD. The rest is a long commercial for the Thomas the Train centers and an ode to Ms. Allcroft. Waste of money.",1
"My 2 year old son is huge Thomas fan. This DVD has long introductions to each story in which children and adults are interviewed - my son couldn't care less. He just wants to see trains! We have a portable DVD player, and it is a big pain to try to fast forward past these introductions, and he (and I) just ends up frustrated. My advice - pick another DVD.",1

"This is one of the worst written books I have ever read.I wish I had saved my money and my time.The book is full of superlatives. Everything is ""the best ever experienced"" again and again.The characters NEVER become embraceable. One male character is pathetic while the other is a jerk. The female lead is portrayed as perhaps innocently unaware, but is really just stupid. Her friend is promiscuous, which is all we ever really get to know of her.The writing is at a level well below that of an adult reader. But, the content could not possibly be meant for a younger reader. Very inappropriate.Not sure who would really like this book.Maybe someone who really likes descriptions of food and does not care about plot, story development, characterization or any other facets of literature.Find yourself something with a little more substance, and I think you'll be much happier.",1

"I listened to the audio version of ""Cruel & Unusual"" on a recent trip to New Jersey and back. The first 2/3 of the book kept me on the edge of my seat, then... the whole thing collapsed in a heap at the end. Would have been much better if the author had stuck to writing a taut thriller instead of trying to drag in everything from evil Republican office holders to Nazi war criminals, all dumped into the mix at the last possible moment. After all the buildup, the ""who"" of the whodunnit ends up being... nobody in particular. And the fate of the evildoer? Nothin' much. Disappointing. Won't bother with Dr. Scarpetta or Ms. Cornwall again.I'm a little baffled by all the reviews that say, ""great book, bad ending..."" and still give it 3 stars or more. Isn't a mystery DEFINED by the ending, by how the author ties up all the loose ends and red herrings?",1
"In a word, Lacking. Her style of writing left me unable to appreciate the underlying story which, as a result, I found rather vacuous and inauthentic. So much so that I felt compelled to come write a review of this book so others might avoid making the same mistake I did. No offence Patricia.",1
"This movie was not only NOT funny, but it was excruciatingly boring. I think Adam was channeling the Aristocrats. Whilst Aristocrats was not as funny as it thought itself to be, it was still better than this garbage.",1
Entertaining in places but spoilt by lots of crudeness and dirty talk that degrades woman. In the end I found nothing memorable or funny about this film. Sad for Adam to seem him in such a trashy film.,1
"I used to enjoy Sandler's movies but this one is just....jeez, how to put it? Well, UNFUNNY.All characters are if not stupid, shallow and egotistical...Don't care how 'dramatic' was this supposed to be, his misogynistic prick persona is the worst ever. Just, don't watch it, really...You'll want those minutes from your life back.",1
"I should have known going into this movie having Judd Apatow a part of it would mean I would hate it. However, having Adam Sandler in it and seeing the previews in the theater we gave it a (very hopeful) chance. The movie loses it's true premise of having depth in amongst the terrible & crude ""jokes"". I have to say we didn't make it more than 30 minutes into the movie before turning it off. It is a constant barrage of pathetic behavior. I just don't believe that there are this many people out here that are like this and can relate to this behavior. Very Disappointing.",1
"I seriously did not expect a dramatic look into the mind of a comedian when I rented this movie. They marketed this movie like the Forty Year Old Virigin and Knocked Up! When I rented the movie I expected a lot of humour and with so many funny actors I put way too much faith in it. My wife and I was so disappointed that we stopped watching it. I don't watch a lot of TV, but when I do watch something I want it to be worth while.If you're into these artsy films about the serious life of people in the spotlight, then you're going to like this film. However, if you're looking for humour like Adam Sandler's previous films (i.e. Happy Gilmore, etc) then you can forget about it.I give this film 1 star because this is not my kind of movie and it was advertised like a great comedy film not drama film. :/",1
This is one of the worst movies I have seen. The dialogue is awful. There is ZERO humor. All the characters are boring and completely humorless.What a loser movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
"Anything with Adam Sandler in it is supposed to be funny. This however, just, well, wasn't. I really do believe that this movie had potential, but there was so much going on, so many stories within the story, that they could have made 3 movies out of it.It's 2 and a half hours long. That's about an hour and a half too long for the main story plot. This movie honestly seemed longer than Titanic, or Gone With The Wind because it is so long and drawn out.There is very little humor in Funny People. The only good thing about it is all the major stars that pop up here and there, which is probably why, in my opinion at least, that this movie even made it to the big screen and didn't go straight to DVD.",1
A truly great example - of how terrible some movies have become!! Vulgar!! Offensive. Unnessisary nudity!! I usually love Adam Sandler - and can't believe he'd stoop so low in this role. Seth is highly likeable in this - but still swears and lowers himself as well. The woman who plays Adams 'romantic interest' is mostly great - but also stoops to swearing - blantant sexuality. The writing is the worst in this movie. This awful movie is 2 hours and 22 minutes long - but only feels like 5 hours. - And I could have spent my life doing something more interesting and exciting like watching paint dry or grass grow. I suggest skipping this movie altogether!! Tragic where movies have gone to. Much has been lost!!Scott MacNeil - comedian.,1
Honestly if you don want to hear a lot of swearing you wont like this. Let alone the story line was ridiculous. Wouldn't recommend!,1
"I normally love Sandler's movies but this was just horrible. None of it flowed right, jokes were horrible vand stupid and just all around made no sense. Don't waste your time and money on this.",1
I must say I never liked Adam Sandler. There were so many more talented people who just never got a chance to be on the screen. I still don't get what's with Adam Sandler.Besides that I decided to give it a shot. It took half hour when I stopped watching.,1
How can anybody even smile with the kind of garbage Adam Sandler ALWAYS performs?This guy is just a moronic retard.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON HIM.,1
"This movie was not an original concept. The jokes were lame, as were the performances. The writer and director disappointed the audience by using Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill as a box office draw. When in fact, it wasn't worth the money to see this film in a theatre.",1
"Save your money. Your time can be MUCH better spent. This was one of the worse movies I ever sat through. Actually, I drifted away close to the end and was thankful I didn't waste that time. Its AWFUL.",1
Not worth the time.Pros: there were several good one-liners; introduced me to new comediansCons: excess foul language; adultry;,1
"This is a nasty, mean-spirited book that exhibits contempt for the Torah and Torah values. When I picked up this book at the local library, I assumed that I would just love it and want to buy a copy for my college-age daughter (who is also a cat-owning Rabbi's daughter). But this isn't just some loveable cat regaling us with home-spun, and potentially Torah-based wisdom. No, this cat uses bad language, is obsessed with masturbation and, on occasion, likes to grab the nearest lady cat and ""show"" her (and us, unfortunately) a thing or two. (Anyone for cat pornography?) Oh, and the lovable rabbi ends up desecrating Shabbos (the Sabbath) and eating trefe (non-kosher) food in a crisis of faith brought on by finding out that his daughter's new husband is not strictly observant and his family is not at all observant. Warning: this book is not suitable for children!",1
"This is the tale of a kindly Rabbi, his sweet daughter and the cat who loves her. The tale seems promising at first, until it delves into bitterness over God and those who love Him and follow His laws. The cat represents the glorification of sin itself, and delights whenever the book's characters fall into ungodly habits, judging them forever as hypocrites (taking no account into repentance and future avoidance of said sin). As is the case with most humanist literature the story down spirals from that point until it ends with the Rabbi losing faith in God. At this point the cat is truly happy with the Rabbi, thus giving the tale a 'happy ending'. In short, 'The Rabbi's Cat' is a tale structured to appeal to secular humanists, atheists and pagans who want to feel better about their self-serving, do as you feel, lifestyles.One more note: This book, despite the beautiful artwork and appealing cover, is definitely not appropriate for children.",1
"As someone who is interested in different cultures, I thought the book would be an interesting window into other people's thoughts. Instead, I open it to find a swearing cat (he uses the F word) denigrating religion and showing religious people as hypocrites, in a lame stereotypical way. Might be interesting to others, but its not interesting to me. Not only is it not suitable to children, but there are a lot of adults who would not want to be bothered with this kind of disrespect and vulgarity either. I wish I had been warned before I tried to read this book.",1
"Jean Hill's story changed with the wind. She saw next to nothing during the assassination, but used her unique location (and her active imagination)to keep herself in the limelight for years. It got so bad that even the conspiracy writers were shying away from her toward the end. It was laughable.Someone needed to ask her about the ""little dog"" she said was sitting in the car with JFK and Jackie. (Look at the original interviews- she actually said it.)This book is BS from stem to stern. Go read a fairy tale, at least there's a moral at the end. The only thing you find at the end of this book is your wallet a little lighter!",1
"This DVD was entiled ""Seventh Cliburn Competion, 1985"" It was not the competion program, and did not even contain the winning performance. I consider it to be a total fraud and misrepresentation.",1
"Well, that's no fun. Honesty is the best policy, right? This was the first of Patricia's books I had the displeasure to become acquainted with. I've tried reading another of her works, but I can't get over the simplistic writing with unnecessary adjectives thrown in for no apparent reason except, perhaps, to make the sentences longer and make the reader suffer from the protracted tripe. More than that, this book failed to make me care about the characters or about the outcome of the story",1
"This could be the worst novel I have ever read. It is also the first and last Patricia Cornwell novel I will ever read. There are so many problems with this book that they cannot be listed here, so here are but three points: 1) The main character, Kay Scarpetta, is an insufferable, humorless snob. I'd never before read a novel where I hated the main character. Great job, Pat! 2) About 90% of the novel is dialogue. Very bad dialogue. But this is understandable since Cornwell cannot write prose. 3) The story is predictable and boring, and the ending is utterly ridiculous. I'm astonished that this book was ever published, let alone made the bestseller lists.",1
"This book is so unrealistic that it spoils all the fun, super killers like Temple Gault (a clone for the Satan Incarnate known as Hannibal Lecter) are more silly than super. I found all the other character two dimensional and all the ""intrigue"" regarding super computers insulting to my intelligence. Has Cornwell done better? I don't know and, after reading this, am in no big hurry to find out.",1
"At least, that's how I felt about this book, which seems only to have been published because the author has written some truly interesting previous novels. I recommend the first three books in the series. I cannot recommend this book for anything except kindling. However, not having a fireplace, I filed this under G.",1

"The authors seem unaware of the fact that theory guides our understanding. There are no ""objective"" facts, yet the authors present all their findings as such with almost no reasoning attached. This is both arrogant and ignorant. The authors display no grasp of theoretical advances in Accounting and I recommend getting a book that has a better exposition of principles as more than practice",1

"I am in my 60's and thought it would be a good time to remedy what I perceived as a gap in my education, economics. I never had a course in economics and the only book I had read was Heilbroner's Worldly Philosophers, a satisfying but very general overview as I recall. I probably read Heilbroner in the late 70's.I'm an audible subscriber and got Economics in One Lesson from them. I can only say that the book was dated, full of economic events that were referenced from WWII, and excessively polemical and rigid.I read it some time ago but it made enough of a bad impression on me that when I saw it in my suggestion list around number 250, I just had to get onto this page and say what a terrible disappointment the book was.I think the book should be retitled, Economics in One Polemic: The Shortest and Surest Way to Understand the Economics of the Late 1940's and the 1950's.",1
"If you want your faith in market forces and low taxation reinforced, this is a straightforward, but blinkered attempt to make you forget all about government regulation. Funny that west-European countries with bigger taxation and more government influence have less crime, better education, better health care, better TV programmes than the US. They also organise their politics better, so that the tax money is better spent. It did set me right on one or two points, and parts are written in a spuriously funny way, but it is too biased to be really informing . Clearly the writer has never listened to people he doesn't agree with.If you have an open mind compare this dangerous nonsense with the writings of Naomi Klein to see how unfettered capitalism works out in practice.",1
"Wow, this one is really out there. Only Any Rand and Ron Paul, who know nothing about economics, could recommend this book. For example, consider these laughable claims, that I paraphrase -The primary problem with economics as practiced is that no thought is given to the long term consequences of policies to all groups.There is no difference between supply and demand.The vast majority of economists are ignoramuses.It is all very simple; listen to me.If you can believe this stuff, read the book. You can get it online for free.",1
Started laughing in the second chapter....enjoyed the book after I realized that I wasn't going to learn anything new. It's obviously a miracle that we survived for the 65 years since it was first published.And seeing that the pending insolvency of the US was as loudly shouted in the 40's as it is now was worth the price. This book had quotes that would shame both modern day political extremes in the US.Kudos to whoever owns the copyright --- now there's economics in action.,1
I wish I had read more of the reviews to learn that this book is less about economics and more about pushing a particular political point of view. The point of view is hard right and the current recession disproves most of the economic patter. After skimming a few pages I threw it away; I didn't even want it in the house.,1
"This is propaganda, not an economics lesson. The book is full of faulty logic apparently spewed to promote a libertarian agenda. I couldn't be less happy with this purchase.",1
"Threw this book right in the trash not even a chapter into it, because I realized it is nothing but the same old recycled and obsolete right-wing drivel that we've been peppered with over and over, and that took our country to the edge of a second Great Depression. If you are a concerned American you should stay away from this book!",1
"This book was about witches and possession. I do not believe in those things. I am a Christian! I did not like this book very much at all! I don't think this is a good book for kids to be reading, because they might have nightmares. Some of the stories are hard to comprehend. But if you do like those kind of things you will enjoy this book! Thank you for reading my review.",1
I just ordered this fudge. It looked so good and seemed to be priced well I thought I would give it a try. I have looked at just about every store where we live and can not find any maple fudge. I am hoping this will taste as good as it looks. I will send another feedback after I have had my first bite. Can't wait.,1
"After trying three different sizes,I still couldn't find one that fit. I first ordered a medium and it wouldn't even come close to hooking so I went up to size to xlarge which was waaay to big, my last possible option would be a large and it was still huge, wish I would have sent it back but was just tired of the whole process and kept it. The hooks are a pain as well and it is way over priced.....there is a zippered option on amazon that is much cheaper.",1
"I've been wearing the waist clincher for the last two years. I purchased a new one recently and it's not the same type of material of the previous ones i've brought. I thought maybe because i had lost weight, so i brought a smaller sizer, but that one didn't fit the same either. I thought i found a miracle when i first purchased the girldle through Amazon, but i have found my recent purchase has surely let me down...",1
"I ordered according to the size chart for my measurements and it was way to small!! Very uncomfortable.I returned it,",1
"The Sizes run really small, It flips up even though, they said it would not and the hooks don't hold. I am very dissapointed.",1
"I think this product provided a great fit. I was able to hook on the first row by myself within about 5 mins max. It wasn't quite as difficult to get on as I thought it might be, although it isn't particularly easy either. I tried it on and wore for about 2 hours, and then the 2nd time I wore it had it on for about the same period of time. I took it off and one of the metal boning pieces had popped through and was hanging out at the bottom. This product is far too expensive to have something like that happen. The fit on me was snug, but I am sure I had the correct size. Now I have to figure out how to get this resolved.",1
"It was really easy to put the Squeem on, but once it was on I couldn't wait to get it off!! It wasn't too tight or anything. The problem was that once I stood up straight it bunched up in the hip/mid back area and pinched my skin! It was so painful! No matter how I positioned it, it would bunch up! Really disappointed since it was a waste of $50..",1
I really wanted this item to work because everybody seemed to love it. It didn't hold anything in on me and it gave me back boobs. Waste of money for me.,1
"I washed it before used it for the first time. The next day I wore it, I found my skin were itchy all over place on my stomach. And I feel that the heat on my body trapped on that.",1
"I ordered this product to slim down my stomach. I was looking for something I could wear all day with my jeans as well as underneath my dresses. I wore the squeem to work occasionally and then I would take it off when I got home. When I would take it off, I felt sore around my sides and my back, I washed the squeem several times and even wore it on the other side thinking this would help but it didn't. One night after work me and some of my coworkers went out for drinks so I ended up keeping the squeem on for about 14hours instead of my normal 9 hours. That night when I took the squeem off I had blisters and bruising on my side and back which have now left black marks (I'm black)on my body. I read other review before I purchased the squeem and I didn't see anything that alerted me not to buy it. Not sure why this happened but if you read this and it happens to you don't say I didn't warn you!",1
"The Squeem is a great idea, but their quality is second rate, and their customer service is worse than useless. I'd owned mine for about 4 weeks and worn it only a few hours a day when I noticed that a seam was coming unstitched. The threads aren't frayed; they're unstitching from the seam.Contacting customer service has been an exercise in futility. They've asked for pictures of the damage, and then failed to respond to the pictures, or any further attempts to contact them.For what this costs, it needs to last longer than 4 weeks.",1
So according to the size chart on the box size small is for waistline 28-31my waist is 28 so i got the smallit does not even come close to being able to close and clasp!maybe it's just me but i am terribly disappointed,1

It definitely gives you great posture, I was sitting up straight like no other! although i wish they could improve on the rubber smell otherwise it's wonderful!^^^^^ was my review when i had it for 15-20 days, now-- after ordering it on Jan, 21, 2012-- it's SO useless. I've washed it with care, it smells like rubber, and it's pretty nasty. I'd rather pay $$$ and buy something that works the way it should.",1

"As most people readers know, Jack Higgins has written many fine action-packed books. However, this book reads like a twelve-year-old wrote it. The characters are so transparent they could be ghosts.The author and his publishing house must really need the money to rip of the public in this manner. This is the last book I read by this author. One can only rest on his laurels for so long. I'm glad this book was handed down to me or I would have written a really nasty review.",1
"Where did the real Jack Higgins go? This is not only Higgin's worst effort to date, it is probably the worst book I've read in the past 5 years. (Can you say 'lazy', Jack?)I can't believe I actually finished it, and one star is a generous rating. Unbelievable chapter after unbelievable chapter, no character or plot development, written like a 5th grader.The end of the book foretells a sequel...a book that I will immediately pass on. Probably my last Higgins book without reading the reviews first.Don't buy it -- don't borrow it -- don't read it.",1
This book is not well written and leaves nothing to the imagination. If I hadn't bought it in hard cover and spent the money I would not even have finished reading it.,1
Looks good. No leaks but this is NOT as advertised as being able to hook up to most reverse osmosis water filters which is why I bought it so save more counter top space. I have reached out to the sellar to try to troubleshoot shoot but no response,2

Not worth the hype in my opinion. There was VERY little difference in the before and after for me and my daughter.,2
I bought this item because of the 5 star reviews.I’ve used this several times with absolutely no difference in my teeth color. I would not recommend.,2
"I was super excited to try this carbon toothpaste that also whitens! The packaging is great and the color of the paste is pleasing to the eye. Here's the thing though, I don't think I'm the target demographic because it did nothing for my teeth. I'm trying not to blame the product because my teeth are pretty stained from when I smoked for years and also coffee. So I didn't notice any significant or even insignificant change to the color of my teeth when I used this but when I switched back to my usual whitening toothpaste, I of course noticed it immediately. Perhaps someone without the wear and tear of my dental history will have better luck. This could work on someone with only light staining on their teeth but unfortunately not for me.",2
"Tastes of grape, that's all, doesn't whiten teeth",2
It did not attach to the toothpaste tube tight enough.,2
"The product comes out as a foaming mess that has a disgusting feeling in the mouth. I tried it anyway, to give it a chance. Absolutely no difference in teeth color than before. Don't waste your money.",2
The seal was broken and the product was very moist from humidity and I will not be using.,2
If I had seen that these tablets were foaming toothpaste tablets I would not have purchased them. I ended up having to go to the store to purchase some without that ingredient.,2
"I expected that each eye would adjust as needed; however, the one eye that I needed improvement appeared to adjust but my other eye, without any sight problem, also adjusted so now I have the same problem but the other eye. Cheaper to keep as back up then return.",2
The autofocus works fine. I just had cataract surgery 4 weeks ago and the second eye last week so I couldn't focus to even use my cell phone. The glasses are cheaply made but will hopefully last for 5 more weeks until my prescription ones arrive.,2
"GOOD QUALITY LENSES BUT THE FRAME IS BROKE IN A MONTH, LIKE I'VE BOUGHT CHEAP QUALITY. VERY DISAPOINTED , SOMETHING WENT WRONG WITH MATERIAL THEY STARTED USE , HAD MY OTHER PAIR FOR YEARS AND IT TOOK A BEATING, THIS TIME VERYWEAK CONSTRUCTION",2
The lens came off several times and I ultimately lost one of the pait. The lenses were meticulously cleaned before installation. They worked well until the lens fell out Disappointed!,2
Too Heavy,2
"While I measured carefully, the clips were too narrow for my glasses so I returned them. Lesson learned--seller refunded less than half of the purchase price.",2
"I need very light reading correction (0.5), which these claim to help since they range 'automatically' from 0.5-2.5 in strength. At a normal reading distance for me, everything is very blurry with these on, there is no 'auto' adjusting. The product name also mentions ""multi flex focus dial"". I don't know what 'multi flex' is supposed to mean, but I can tell you there is NO focus dial. As far as I can tell they are plain 2.5 strength readers, which, for me, is way too strong. Color me disappointed and shame on the seller for keyword stuffing their product name with incorrect info.",2
AFTER OPENING THE PACKAGE AND CHARGING THE GLASSES I PUT THEM ON AND THEY SCRATCH MY NOSE. I CHECKED THEM AND THERE WAS NO NOSE PIECE TO PROTECT MY NOSE. I HAD TO RETURN THEM AND ORDER ANOTHER BRAND.,2
Quality is fine for the price but I look like Mrs Claus. lol. I'm not even that old.,2
"I might have ordered the wrong magnification, but I also didn't like the iridescent coating on the outside of the lenses.",2
The lens automatically fog up when you put the glasses on and I think they are low quality lens. Love the look and the replacement batteries but I will not reorder these.,2
"I decided to try bifocals for my first readers, hoping they’d save me from constantly taking them on and off. Unfortunately, they didn’t quite work out. The reading focal area is way too low, which makes it uncomfortable and awkward to use. The focus area is oddly positioned and doesn’t blend well with the rest of the frame, making it look unattractive. While they’ll do in an emergency, the quality just isn’t there. I ended up switching to a different brand with progressive lenses for a much better experience.",2
I've been wearing Foster Grant reading glasses for years and always purchase the same model. The glasses that I ordered were to be Ironman IronFlex black/red framed glasses. Instead of shipping the ordered glasses I was sent unframed glasses blue/grey#dg1123 IM1001 GUN. I was to receive IM2002 model but didn't. Caution buying these glasses.,2
I purchased these to replace my previous pair of the same glasses. These seem to be much larger and kept falling off my head/face. Will be returning these.,2
This is the third pair of these exactly same glasses that I’ve purchased. This pair was loose at the temples on arrival and tightening didn’t resolve the issue. Kept because they arrived at Christmas just before traveling out of town,2
Don’t waste your money on these glasses! Worn for reading only and the lens falls out! The arms are extremely tight. Very flimsy.,2
I dislike the feeling of wearing them and seeing outside the frames and inside. It was very odd and disconcerting. I returned them. They made you dizzy looking up.,2
Cannot wear for a long time as edges are hard. Have to line up perfectly as not to have double vision.,2
I braved the bright morning commute sunshine to test these. (I'm just a passenger) No shading at all. Yes I gave them time sat them on my dash too. No luck. Painful. Wearing my polarized sunglasses I could see some slight rainbow staring on the edges but not enough to tint the lenses. Also the bifocal line is really pronounced right in the middle of my eyeline - and maybe that's just the size of my face I have a smaller head. If you zoom in on my pic you can see what I'm talking about. I could still use inside or at home but only while specifically reading. I don't think I could walk around with the bifocal line.,2
Attempted to catch them from falling from my face and they snapped in 2..,2
Doesn’t cool at room the size it says it does:-(,2
"I usually don’t write reviews, especially negative ones. I liked this product when I initially got it. But after using it for only two summers the pump stopped working even with regular cleaning and maintenance. Because the water is no longer pumped into the filter, it does not actually cool anything. It looks like the pump can’t be easily replaced. So I liked it in the beginning but it didn’t last. Now I just use it as a bulky floor fan.",2
Don't recommend it,2
This unit just blows hot air around and doesn’t measure the temp in the room only the temp of air it’s putting out.,2
"The ice packs would melt and warm up fast, and you only felt the cool air when you are about 2 feet or closer. The fan does not blow hard/fast enough.",2
This product cools my from 95 degrees to about 90 degrees if I’m lucky. Save your money and buy an a/c unit.,2
It stays cool for a few hours and then doesn’t. It’s also difficult to clean as you can’t remove the tank.,2
Don’t cool down,2
Does not blow cold air long even with the ice pack in the bottom,2
I ordered this to cool a bed room for my kids. It’s hot and humid.. the AC UNIT needs work and thought this would help but wasn’t worth it and ima have to return.. I don’t feel the difference from fan to AC it’s all the same the humidifier looks like it works as the vents cleaned my air in 1day the filter was getting fDirty,2
The only time you cool off is if you’re right in front of it.I don’t not recommend and SUCH a waist of money!,2
Annoying flashing lights when off. Ice packs swell too much even half full. Good for a small room but not a powerful fan. Can't complain for the price though.EDIT 9/23/2022: Piece of junk now. Swing function quit working. Pump intermittent and indicator light quit working. Cheap for a reason. Would not buy again.,2
"Received this couple months ago doesn't do much ,,fan works better .not advisable for the money very disappointed",2
What a joke! This cooler might cool you if you stand right in front of it. It would not cool 5 square feet let alone 200 square feet. It is a pain in the but you have to have keep filling it with water and ice bottle (which lasts about 25 minutes. 2out of 5!,2
Wouldn’t buy again.1. This doesn’t substitute an air conditioner2. Works with water and electricity3. You need to have it very close to you to get any coolness4. The water only lasts 4hrs,2
It being to squeals badly after about 6 months of use.,2
"It's an okay unit, tales awhile to get cool air out of the unit and the fan isn't very strong even at max.",2
"Customer Service is Priority ONE with this company--A principal from the company personally called me for feedback on the cooler. I experienced what I thought was an incomplete assembled cooler, but after speaking with the principal/owner, it was apparent they made significant improvements to the unit to allow ice to be used in the water, which cools the air about 30 degrees more than normal. Their fan motors are of superior quality, sealed units. I live in Phoenix, AZ where summer temps are record breaking at 118 degrees, we use our Cajun Kooler coupled with our mister system so we can enjoy being outside on the patio. This unit is superior to others we've tried, and I highly recommend it.",2
haven't used yet,2
"This is a cheaply made unit but it works okay for what it is.Before my actual review, I wanted to mention the ice packs because a lot of reviews complain about them. Yes, the ice packs melt quickly. You'll need to keep a few and rotate them through the freezer if you want consistent ice packs. This is not a product flaw. It's just physics. Putting something frozen in water- a heat sink- makes it melt faster than when just on a surface.Now for my actual product feedback.The air that comes out of it, even without ice packs, is definitely cooler than the air that comes out of an ordinary fan.It isn't strong enough to really significantly cool a space, but for a very small space or for the area immediately in front of it, it works reasonably well. It will be much more effective in an arid climate than in a humid one. To counteract this in the humid area I live in, I simultaneously run a dehumidifier.I had it for about 2 days with it working quite well with constant use. Partway through the third day, it started to leak pretty badly. I opened it up and tightened all the internal screws I could reach, then closed it again. Unfortunately, the leak continues. I will be returning this and trying a different model that is hopefully made better.",2
It doesn’t get really cold!,2
"This cooler is not bad, it just doesn’t cool 1100 square feet! Not even close. It’s actually 1100 CUBIC square feet which is not even a 12’x12’x8’ room. (1152 cu ft) The advertising is misleading. It also takes distilled water so the deposits and minerals don’t clog it up. Amazon has 18 gallons for over $60 so that will get you less than 30 hours. If you have a small room or you put that thing right on you, it’s not much better than a good fan.",2
It was working great but the pump diedIn 4 months,2
"The water tank and the ice things. This thing really aint worth it. Just take the plan and you get a portable ac unit Because this thing it works somewhat, but honestly not enough",2
"As the headline said, the boom mic introduces echo and buzzing, the exact opposite of what I'd intended by buying a more expensive headset. Plus, they only record at 16 bit, 48KHz, well below anything reasonable. Save your money and buy a $5 headset if you want the boom mic, because this one simply isn't fit for purpose. The only bright side is the comfort and the audio out, but the difference of $35 between this and the boom-mic headset I got at 5 Below isn't justified for that.",2
"Never mishandled, but after a year of use the microphone only works when placed at a certain angle now and is very inconvenient.",2
The only real issue with the stand is the shaft and piece the headphones rests on. Its very poor quality. I super glued it together and it lasted another couple of weeks before it broke again with simple use. Spend your money elsewhere.,2
Hooked into A40TR and my voice cuts out very frequently to others I am talking to.,2
"This headset didn’t connect with my xbox what so ever, even though it says it is, would be perfect for anything else though",2
"This is a good looking and useful headphone stand but the RGB stopped working after 2 days of use. Already tried to unplug and plug it again, no luck, holding the rgb button, no luck. It just stopped working and it's disappointing after so little use. If I want to return the item I would have to send it with an international courier service because I'm not located in USA, so shipping it back would cost to me like double the cost of the actual item.",2
This is the 2nd one I have purchased and believed it was identical to the other one. There is no mute option. Don't recommend if your kid games as muting is something they all do.,2
Stop working after one day,2
"This headset is comfortable, the audio is good, the battery life is good. I really like that the mic flips up and down and mute itself when you do so. All the things you think about with a headset are on point. I wish I could end the review there, but everything else makes this thing a pain to use.The main reason I went with this is because I already use some other Corsair peripherals with iCUE. Using this headset with iCUE is actively worse than without. First and foremost, when you're not using iCUE, the headset uses a series of beeps to for audio feedback when you mute or unmute. These beeps are very clear, and they vary in tone in a manner that makes it intuitive whether what you just did was to mute or unmute. These beeps sound whether you click the physical mute button or flip the mic up or down. When the headset is controlled by iCUE, these beeps are completely disabled, and you're left with two options: No mute sounds at all, or use the extremely grating voice prompts. Why can't I just hear the beeps? It makes no sense.You can replace the voice prompt audio with your own .WAV files, but what you'll find is that iCUE has a something like a half-second delay in reading custom .WAV files, and even if there wasn't, there's no active audio connection. The audio connection only starts when audio plays, and it takes an additional half-second *after* audio starts for anything to get to the headset, so it cuts off the first half of the audio. In practice, this means if you have a second long audio clip, you'll only hear half of it. If you have a half-second long audio clip, you'll hear nothing. Why send audio feedback through the audio channel instead of playing them natively on the headset? It makes no sense.Note that this is through the USB dongle with a dedicated connection to the headset. I understand that the various versions of Bluetooth will have these latency and cut-off issues, and that's the main reason why I chose this headset that comes with a dongle. Why does the dongle have the same issues that Bluetooth does? Does the dongle use Bluetooth for its connection? If so, then *what is the point of the dongle*? All phones, all laptops, all consoles, and most desktop PCs (mine included) have Bluetooth built-in. Why ship a dongle that has all the downsides of not having a dongle? It makes no sense.Also, when connected through the dongle, infrequently (but extremely noticeably) something goes completely wrong and the microphone audio just totally corrupts. I haven't had the pleasure of hearing it myself, but multiple times have the people I'm talking to started freaking out about how I was getting sucked into a wormhole. When this happens, it doesn't stop, and the only way to get the audio back in working order is to unplug and replug the dongle. Turning the headset off and back on doesn't even work. I don't know if it's a driver issue or what, but I can't risk a losing customer or client trust because my hardware just fails in the middle of something.So throw the dongle out, right? Just use Bluetooth natively. Yeah, I tried that too. The latency issues with the headset are much worse than what I see with other Bluetooth devices, outside of my $5 set of earbuds. This thing is $50 ($100 with the dongle that makes the experience worse), they couldn't have put a better Bluetooth module in it? I've used no-name speakers with better Bluetooth. Why put inferior components in your mid-range device? I'd say it makes no sense, but it's really just cost cutting at the expense of consumers who don't know any better. (Un)Fortunately for me, I do know better.And one last issue, and last because this might just be my system, but when the headset is connected via Bluetooth, Windows Audio Service uses upwards of 5 GB of RAM and some 10-15% of CPU on my 13th Gen Intel i7. I don't see other connected devices, audio or otherwise, using this amount of resources. On top of that, the headset broadcasts itself as multiple different devices, presumably one to connect to the dongle and one (or more?) to connect via native Bluetooth. This makes it really hard to isolate and troubleshoot any issues, because it's not easy to tell if you need to look at ""CORSAIR HS55 WIRELESS Gaming Headset"" or ""CORSAIR HS55 Stereo"" or ""CORSAIR HS55 WIRELESS HANDS-FREE AG"" or whatever else in device manager or sound settings.I put up with all these issues for a month, swapping between connection methods, trying different settings, googling workarounds, convincing myself that there must be a way to make this thing good. After a month, I have found that there is not. There's no way to use this thing that isn't aggressively bad in one way or another. I wish I could pick and choose different aspects of the different connection methods and combine them into a singular, cohesive, and broadly good experience, but it's not possible. And since the return window closes after 30 days, I guess I'll just be out the cash with a bad product that could be good but isn't. If this is the sort of experience I can expect from Corsair, then I guess I know not to get any further invested in the ecosystem.",2
"The media could not be loaded. I bought this yesterday (4/30/23), when I originally plugged it in and set it all up it worked. Today when I set my controller on it the lights in the bar went absolutely insane. I didn’t think much about it and was gone all day. I came back to my controller not charged and the lights still going crazy. I took it off the charger and the lights work fine. I put my controller on it and crazy lights… my phone won’t even charge anymore when plugged into it. Really annoyed, and will be contacting customer service.Update: I got in contact with the company who makes these and they sent me a new one free of charge… I’ve had it 24/hours and it’s working okay. It’s a little wonky when I set my controller down it freaks out but after about 5 minutes it works like normal.. I will give it some more time before I change my review completely or keep it the same. It was nice if the company to send me a new one though.",2
"Received console and accessories as advertised in the description to replace a similar previous refurbished system that was sent back. Upon trying to power up system after making proper connections, found that the controller would not work. Sent everything back for a refund.",2
"Haven’t played the game hooked it up to my TV. Can’t seem to make the controller compatible to the game. It came with the game, but for some reason it’s acting like it’s not compatible so I haven’t played it.",2
The product is not good,2
This item came in the color was distorted. It looks more navy blue and white. Did not look anything like the black-and-white picture shown online.,2
"The paper was very wrinkled and creased and was delivered folded. It would have been packaged with a sturdy piece of cardboard. The paper was also extremely thin (paper meets tissue paper). If the papers were not wrinkled and creased it would have made a decent placemat, but in its current state it looked cheap and I ended up throwing away so many sheets because I couldn't use them for anything.",2
These look cheap. Colors are not realistic. We chose not to use them for our event.,2
"Pros - Placemats are colorful and seem sturdy. Cons - Dozens of errors in the maps. Problems with places being misnamed, colors (sometimes contiguous countries have the same color), the names of cities are larger than the names of states or countries. Names are cut off so you can't read them. These placemats useless for teaching geography, but we are having a lot of fun spotting and discussing errors!",2
Lifeless colors. Returned. Previously a fan of Pimpernel.,2
"Product has edges peeling up after a few weeks, and very difficult to keep these glossy mats looking clean. Poor quality.",2
"Nice print, it is very thin, I don’t think is going to last long, I will have to iron it because it came with wrinkles. Not that happy with them, it looks better in picture",2
Really cheap and thin,2
Product is totally not a placemat. More a coaster!!!! If I was bothered I would return them but as I am incapacitated with a back problem they will be used as very expensive candle base to protect furniture. So disappointed. Just wouldn’t buy them ever!!,2
"Experienced serious performance issues which prompted me to return the product. The issues all involved the Chrome browser. Clicking links on pages, creating new tabs and generally doing anything on the browser stuttered and paused. No other processor intensive activity was taking place, the only thing open was the Chrome browser. The issue went away after a while but I wasn't taking any chances. The experience was so disappointing and I was wary of it happening again that I decided that it was simply best to just return the item.",2
I hardly use the darn thing be it drives me crazy! I needed a new laptop and right now Apple was out of my price range. I am so over & done with windows so this seemed like a nice option. It is very printer fussy. It would work with the one I had but it gave a list of printers that would. I ordered one from that list. Nope. Wouldn't work. I wanted a lighted keyboard. I didn't know that the only lighted keyboard was the touch screen one that insists on popping up constantly when I'm using the other (unlit) keyboard. I really prefer the raised keys of a keyboard over touchscreen for typing. It has some nice features. Holds a charge well. Will store your info so you don't need to enter it yourself but most computers do that. The screen size is nice. But the negatives far outweigh the positives for me. I regret the purchase.,2
"I purchased this unit and really enjoyed it. Even though it was bigger than i normally use, i was going to keep it anyway but unfortunately relentless wifi issues made me return it. Constant disconnects from anything requiring a reliable connection. Amazon luna constantly kicked me out, geforce now and xcloud both had constant disconnects. I couldnt get through a 20 minute zoom meeting without a dozen reconnects. I have other devices, including chromebooks that dont have any issues with my internet. Being a chromebook means i cant swap for another wifi chip leaving me to return. Perhaps it was only my unit but truly unfortunate.",2
"It’s a great buy for the price. There’s no debating that. However, no manual included. I bought it posted as excellent condition. Nothing could be further from the truth. Many scratches on both sides of the keyboard. Surface scratches on the lid. I can actually live with that. Looked like a big dirt stain in the exact middle of the screen. Nope it’s a ding and it’s deep enough to fit the tip of your fingernail. The fact that it actually works is the only thing stopping me from giving one star. I was under the impression this was from Amazon but it’s an individual seller. I’m okay with that but maybe some more transparency and honesty would have me in a better mood",2
"This is advertised as having 64GB storage plus a 64GB MicroSD for a total of 128GB storage. It does come with a MicroSD card and an SD adapter, but there is no place to plug either one in. The instruction sheet shows a location for inserting the card, but that slot does not exist on the computer we received.",2
It arrived without the charger.,2
"This thing was a pain in the neck to set up any software not purchased at the “Microsoft Store.” Even programs that were pre-loaded on the system as purchased could not be activated or accessed without knowledge of how to access the magic handshake that Microsoft support would not provide. I had to go to individual software providers such as McAfee and Adobe to figure out how to enable commonly used programs. Even setting up an existing HP printer was not for the meek..everything defaults through HP’s cloud and, again, no support from HP to enable local print spooling. The speed and user interface is no better than the 8 y.o. Windows 10 system I replaced (forced obsolescence, because Windows 10 won’t be supported past 2025 and many programs already could not be updated). Then there’s this flash-card approach to local storage…what a cheesy way to force users to buy storage space in the cloud. Now I know why iOS and Google based systems are more expensive and likely worth the premium.",2
"This is a very nice and powerful laptop for the price, working well and fast, battery life is not great but fine if you adjust the power setting.The add implies that MS office is included in the laptop, however it is only installed, to use it you can get 30 days free trial (by putting your CC info) but than you must pay.This misleading product info really leaves a bitter taste from this purchase. As a consumer I just want to get what was advertised, nothing less nothing more.",2
"Just like the reviews of this laptop- the hinge cover was missing! As this is for a 13 year old, I am not sure that I want to keep it. With the missing piece, it makes me wonder how long this will last. I gave it two stars because it powers on quickly.",2
I never turned it on or tried charging it. A piece is missing,2
This is the slowest and loudest Chromebook I've ever owned. It will shutdown at random the fan is constantly on. I've not altered the system in any way. I stick to regular updates and maintain recommended security protocols. Super disappointed.,2
"The only good about this chromebook is the Intel Evo 5 processor, the rest is us a Chrome web browser. All android apps will run in phone or tablet mode, but not in full screen. For the money this latptop cost, you can buy two lenove tablet P12 and will have all the same functionaity plus all your apps will run in full screen mode, plus the same browser experience. Chromebook is bulky and abttery life no good at all.",2
"I purchased this after seeing an embroidery digitizer use it in a video online. One of the well-known digitizing software companies even recommends it on its site. While the reviews online seem to vary, I figured at this price it was worth a shot.It arrived quickly. The packaging is okay, though if it had been included in a box with something heavy, I would have concerns about it being protected well enough.The instructions it came with were insufficient at best. They basically say to insert a battery, plug in the dongle to your computer, and the pen will automatically connect as it was paired at the factory. There are no markings on the inside of the pen or in the instructions to tell you which direction to insert the battery.Despite our technical knowledge, neither my husband nor I were able to get this pen to connect to any computer in our household. The wireless mouse I purchased the same day worked just fine though, so that leads me to believe it was a problem with the pen.Holding the pen felt unnatural to me. It's oddly shaped, probably for ergonomics, but it fails in this way.Perhaps others have had better luck, but this is going back and I'll have to do further research on a digital pen.",2
"I have to tap several times or really smash with my index finger to get the to work. Using it properly, by using thumb for left click and pinky for right click is impossible.",2
Keep in a drawer for when the cat chews the cord on your normal keyboard to order another normal keyboard.,2
Cheap. Sits crooked. The water doesn't make a dripping sound like it should. It doesn't come out of the top strongly to create A solid stream. It just dribbles out. Very disappointed.,2
"Worked beautifully for a few months, and then kept slowing down until the ball just finally stopped turning altogether. It also started leaking and I was afraid of damage to my furniture, so I disposed of it. A shame--it was a beautiful fountain.",2
I bought this for a friend and watched it with him. I knew it would be bad and it was. I guess if you like this kind of thing then it would be good for you. I on the other hand have taste.,2
"Bad special effects, a completely wooden plot nailed to cardboard characters, bad acting and cheesy gore effects do not compliment would could have been a very scary movie. Inexplicably incestious Cat people live like cia undercover agents in a small town, and stake out victims to gain energy. There is no explanation as to what these creatures are, and basically the whole thing is a solid vehicle for a bunch of scenes involving painfully conspicious latex prop limbs being torn and split while the creatures feed off of the energy of fresh victims (one scene where a man has his hand cut off actually rivals luke skywalker's incredibly unconvincing appendage loss in ""The Empire Strikes Back). The cat people themselves are reminiscent of japanese rubber suit monsters (one almost expects power rangers to jump out) and the morphing special effects look ridiculous. Entertaining enough to warrant watching the whole thing ... even If not for any reason it intended to be.",2
"Well the it starts out pretty good. the plot is alright, the actors are pretty good and the special effects are amazing for when it was done. Then in the end it all gets wacky... almost like a comedy. One scene when the seriously dissturbed mom (Alice Krige) kills a guy whit a corncob! But when it really gets bad is in the end when you see how the ""sleepwalkers really look...",2
"It's terrible! About the only thing it had going for it were the special effects and the musical score. Don't get me wrong, I love Stephen King, and I love scary movies, but this one is just plain sick.",2
"This CD just about drove me nuts. I understand that rain is to be expected in a rainforest,but after listening to this recording my pets were lining up two-by-two. This CD is for you if you love a long rain and dripping sounds. I hated it; it was monotonous and I could swear that there were portions that were repeated because the person recording it had to fill up some space and nothing was available.Save your money!",2
"This book is not an easy read; to many diversions within the story to get excited about the character. It hurt my ""head"" to try and stay with it. I enjoy reading, but this book takes the joy out of reading! It has taken me months to get to the 6th chapter",2
"Very average movie, Jonny Debbie as wonderful as ever. If you want to see it then rent it, not a keeper",2
"Yes, Johnny Depp provides another great performance here, as does most of the cast. The story line is what drags this movie down. Beyond the slew of predictable lines and scenarios, I found the message of the film a bit shallow. ""Love conquers all...including schizophrenia."" It's just not life-like. Some of the imagery and allusions are heavy-handed at times. I wanted to scream, ""OK, I get it."" Not a terrible film, but not that great either. If you want to see a more compelling Depp film, see ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape.""",2
"Benny (Aidan Quinn) is the brother of an autistic girl named Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson). He's a bit restrictive and protective of her. Sam (Johnny Depp), the ""quirky"" guy, moves in. Hilarity ensues. So, what's the problem? The moviemakers were not content with making a funny, lighthearted movie. Instead, the movie gets very serious and preachy about several points - whether or not Joon can live on her own, whether or not Sam needs to get a job, etc. These questions are presented as ones with obvious answers, because, of course, love conquers all, as we learn in Hollywood. Sam is portrayed as the truly wise character of the movie, while crazy old Benny is still stuck on backwards ideas like earning money to provide for yourself and caring for the mentally handicapped.There were a few funny parts, courtesy of Johnny Depp, but I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie.",2
"Although Johnny Depp is to be lauded for his deft physical comedy in this romantic fairy tale, it isn't enough to save this implausible film. Depp plays a somewhat eccentric young man who finds himself filling in as a ""housemate"" to a young mentally ill girl who lives with her brother. Mary Stuart Masterson is effective as Joon, and Aidan Quinn does her sincerest best but the film ultimately fails in its ignorance of reality. Julianne Moore has an early appearance as Ruthie, the failed actress who works as a waitress and befriends Benny, Joon and Depp. The movie manages to sugar coat mental illness and we're asked to believe that this obviously disturbed young girl is capable of living on her own. While its message of love conquers all is admirable, the reality of Joon's situation is overshadowed by this sentimentality.",2
"what a boring and pretentious movie! after tortured about 15 minutes, all the family members started to look each other or one another, then all agreed at the same time to reject this stupid shallow movie. depp or no depp, after twenty years, he's still playing the similar roles again and again, and never grows tired of it. but to me, and to us, enough is enough.",2
"This book was okay. It spoke about how gays deal with sexual orientation issues in the workplace. The good thing about it is that it included case studies of a gay black man and a bisexual white woman; so the authors were trying to think about diversity within the LGBT community. However, this book is simplistic and doesn't say much. There are large-scale studies and anthologies out there about gays in the workplace that are more thorough, and just better. You should consider reading this, after you've read all the other stuff on the topic.",2
"Let me just say, I loved the movie Pearl Harbor. But I found the soundtrack to be disappointing. I bought it for the Faith Hill song ""There You'll Be"" If you are like me, I recommend the single.",2
"The so-called soundtrack for ""Pearl Harbor"" is a major disappointment. The film was full of great period songs and music. None of them are on the soundtrack. Instead, you can enjoy an hour of absolutely forgettable, mediocre orchestral background music. OK, the theme song is stirring, at least the first two or three times. But the rest is a real bore. When I want to listen to orchestral music, I go to Bach, Brahms and countless other true pros. Don't get bamboozled by this one!",2
"While the movie Pearl Harbor is amazing, the soundtrack does not follow suite. It begins with a mediocre ballad by Faith Hill and the remaining 8 songs, while nice to listen to, are not Hans Zimmer's best work. Tracks 2-4 are so similar it's hard to tell accompanies the numerous TV trailers. For a 3 hour movie, I them apart. It does not include the powerful music that expected a much longer soundtrack. I'm sure we'll get more music when a follow up CD is released. One will no doubt be released so that consumers who want a better soundtrack have to shell out more money.",2
"I bought this CD for Faith Hills song and hoped the rest of it would be good also. For a movie like this, and an event like this, the music just doesn't fit.There should be some very big, building music here and there isn't. It could have been much better.",2
I was disappointed in this soundtrack. The introductory and final songs were lackluster sentimentality. I would have hoped for something more from the producers. The instrumental offerings lacked excitement and musical tension. I would have though Zimmer would have known better.,2
"Zimmer mostly just rehashes past themes from other films he's done, then throws in a track collaborated on with Faith Hill and some generic period-type music. Big deal. The film stunk and the uninspired score just had me thinking how much better the other films he's worked on were. Zimmer's better than this. The same can be said for most of the directors he usually works with. Perhaps it was just a paycheck to him...who knows.",2
"after last year's majestic score for gladiator, i had high expectations for the pearl harbor soundtrack. much to my dismay, the music no more than ""sorta pretty"". it evokes no feelings like gladiator's worldly mood. plus, with all due respect to mr. zimmer, the defining chord sounds awfully familiar to a Enya song some years ago (i think it was enya). i don't need the faith hill song...... plus, unlike the gladiator score which the listener could visualize the story, the same isn't true with this release of the soundtrack. PLEASE GIVE US MORE MUSIC WITH A SECOND RELEASE!!",2
"Having read Ms. Manning's book, it is obvious that she has somehow managed to overlook perhaps the most important pioneer and innovator of what she calls the ""free energy"" movement:JOSEPH W. NEWMANIt is incredible to me that she could write such a book without including Joseph Newman's long struggle to bring forth his revolutionary technology. Writing such a book without featuring the work of Joseph Newman is as ridiculous as writing a book about the history of aviation and omitting any reference to the Wright Brothers.I would suggest that she view his website videos at:... and perhaps she would discover the essential nature of his successful and innovative technology.Gary",2
"Unfortunately percussion has completeley spoiled all tracks.This is not Bossa Nova,not even Samba.Sorry for a great project with great arrangements.",2
"One month ago (and even earlier) this set was selling for less than half ($41) this current price ($89). While it was a great series that I thoroughly enjoyed watching as a kid, my desire to finally buy it for Christmas has been completely eliminated by the equivalent of holiday induced price gouging. I'll wait till it goes back to a reasonable price. More than a little upset with Amazon over this one. Merry Chri$tma$.",2
Unlike most SciFi shows this show had NO BASIS IN FACT. I must have been much more forgiving as a kid I remembered liking this show at least a little but after watching it again the bazaar story lines and unforgivable scientific inaccuracy I have to give this a total thumbs down.,2
"Not sure whether the original recordings were not preserved well or just our copy is bad, but the sound cuts out frequently on each episode. Would not buy this again.",2
"Even while some of the episodes are questionable and not very realistic, this is a classic show now. Having two seasons, the special effects of the time is still top-notch. While the acting is mediocre, and the story set up is sometimes way out (It was the 70's) there is some entertaining value. As a writer, I still look through this medium to see if there were any parts that can be embellished for newer ideas. What toppled the ratings of this show was the ""Mind"" entity beings that appeared on the first six or so episodes. But after that the writing started to switch to a more action oriented show. I am still looking through the DVD's as I try to remember the better episodes. Quality of picture is fine on widescreen TV's, but this is not an HDTV product.",2
"I found the book to be very general and basic. Most of the information I already knew. There are methods of retrofitting old windows I have seen on home type programs that lightly discuss these topics and which the book does not. Also, the book could use a lot more diagrams and discussions on finishes and paint. The book limits itself to actually restoring to original working condition old windows and nothing about updating. This book is for beginners except that for beginners there should be a lot more pictures. I did find some good tips but not the information I was personally hopeing to find. I am selling the book back.",2
Goes a mile wide and an inch deep. I would rather the same book but each chapter by an expert in that area with a lesson/example.,2
"The FM stereo does not pick up well at all. I cannot get many local stations. The description says it uses USB 1.1 for quick transfers. This is misleading advertising. USB 1.1 is the slower transfer method. USB 2.0 is the faster one.Where this device excels is in conjunction with a MP3 player. The rechargeable battery means you can use it away from a power supply for a long time. The sound is excellent.This would get 3 stars due to the slower transfer speed, false advertising, and poor FM. It gets 2 stars because the price is too high for a refurbished model.I got this for $19.99 directly from Philips web site. I would check there first.",2
"Ok, so I have not actually heard this WHOLE cd. I did hear Bob sing on The Bachelor show and was impressed, but then I heard ""his"" first single, Girlfriend, and was less than impressed. This is for two reasons: a) Bob doesn't really have the rock vibe, which just makes his version of Girlfriend sound wrong (in his defense, the song I heard him sing on tv was Open Arms by Journey, an excellent song, and not easy to sing I don't think). b) I can't deal with the fact that I have not heard Bob publicly credit the originators of the song Girlfriend. The July For Kings version is 100 times better than Bob's, and while I know the band probably appreciates the publicity, they are not getting all the credit they deserve. Check out JFK's cd ""Swim"" and make your own comparison, though if you like Bob's single this CD will likely not disappoint your tastes.",2
"I kinda liked this book for awhile. Some strange humor and interesting to see what is was like to travel at the time of Twain. I thought it was a litte long and boring and though (only read 3/4 of it). Not very exciting and a lot of quotes from other esoteric sources. Also, he makes reference to Arabian nights while in India. Aren't those stories set in the middle east and north africa? (kinda lame)",2
This was a great deal if it had worked. The gas regulator had leak by when set to zero. Amazon was not good about sending a new one they said the price had gone up and I would have to pay the new increased price. I just got a RMA and returned it. Could not get the seller on the phone. Tired of messing with it went to welding supplier and bought new. Some things just should be bought locally.,2
This product does an adequate job of cleaning your feet and does provide some relief for tired aching feet !,2
"I pre-ordered this foot massage spa to relieve niggling pain in my feet. Though the product operated exactly as per the manual, it was rather tame. It didn't really help reduce the pain, rather it merely tried to soothe the feet. Your feet will feel good so long as they are in the spa, but the spa does nothing to reduce the pain. I didn't think its worth spending so much money to just put my feet in hot water (& that too without salts). I've returned the product.",2
"Bought this unit directly from Brookstone over 6 months ago. Was initially great very hot water and jets were comfortable but stopped working after 4 uses. Brookstone would not replace because after it was after ""limited"" warranty coverage. This was an expensive unit and not sure if I would get another one from Brookstone or try cheaper model that hopefully won't break down.",2
I loved the idea of this foot bathbut the product leaked. Brookstone was great to work with for the return.,2
"I purchased this item thinking what I read about it here on Amazon would be true. Unfortunately the heated foot bath and Message is not what it sounds like. The heated part works ok, but as far as the message part, not even close. And the jets, come on, give me a break. For what I paid for this, over $100.00 and the most expensive one that Amazon had at the time I thought I would be getting a good foot bath. If I had to rate this from 1-10 I would give it a 3. Only because it does keep the water warm. In my opinion it is not worth the money or even half of what I paid for it.",2
"Bought this thing as a gift for my wife. She was really excited to get it. Used it twice, with out any salts, and it worked great. Third time she went to use it, the jets didn't work. Got a hold of the company who sold it, and they said no problem, just send it back. So I'm thinking they are going to send me a new one, that works. Made me pay the return shipping, and just put the money back on my credit card.If I sold a defective item to someone, I sure as hell wouldn't ask them to pay for return shipping.",2
"By the time this 9th entry in the Jason Voorhees franchise was released, the series had become tired and ultimately redundant. In an effort to put more life in it, we are faced with a Jason who is killed but like in THE HIDDEN (a far superior film), he manages to live using host bodies. Although the screenwriters try to give us more motivation for Jason's murderous rampage, there is little suspense or novelty in the movie. Jason manages to kill off a few people, and his sister is recruited to finish him off. No real acting honors in this one, although Steven Culp manages to do well in his role as a tabloid tv producer. The ending is a joke in itself, with its reference to future Jason adventures. Not the best in this series.",2
"I cant beleive they did this, they added a crapy plot, ""only a vorhees can kill a vorhees"" WTF??!!!!???!! jason had a sister? what a stupid plot, then at the end you see freddy's hand grabbing jasons mask and pulling it down under the ground (telling me freddy vs. jason is next).if you want to collect the friday the 13th film's i sugest part's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and X.",2
Yes part 9 or Jason goes to hell is a classy entry in the series.Jason's soul jumping from one body to the next might seem ridiculous but they have tried everything else.,2
"Well, I thought Friday the 13th part 5 was bad!? This is the worst ""Friday"" by far and it's only redeeming quality is the nice DVD release and the fact it opens the door for Freddy VS Jason! For that reason alone I rate it 1 1/2 stars!Unfortunately Freddy VS Jason was shelved for many years and was released after Jason X?! Which doesn't make any sense, so we have to pretend that Freddy VS Jason came out before Jason X to have this even begin to make sense.(I use the term loosely!) The only postive thing I can say about this film is that it's got a way too good DVD release and it makes Jason X and Freddy VS Jason look all that much better!I was really disappointed with this entry even though 'Jason Takes Manhattan' isn't much better! If you want to complete the Friday the 13th series, it should be seen as it does set up the superior sequel 'Freddy VS Jason'.",2
How could anyone think that Jason was dead. That killer in it was smart in saying he's not but what makes the world think he can stop Jason. I was really disappointed with this one even though my standards for Friday movies are extremely low. I really only watched this for the end part when Freddy's hand pulls Jason into hell and belive me it wasn't worth it one bit.Another horrible thing about this movie was it's cast. That fat diner owner was so stupid with the whole Vorhees Birger and Jason fries. When Jason came in there I was so happy when all of them were killed. This one was really disappointed when I saw this and it isn't even worht the two star rating I gave it.,2
"I have always been a fan of the Friday the 13th series. I'd seen each of the movies a dozen times, but had somehow missed this particular movie. I barely even remembered hearing about it.I finally got to see it a few days ago and, wow... I mean, I honestly gave this movie a chance. I really did. This installment into the series is what PART 3 was to the HALLOWEEN series. Jason is barely in the movie. When you do see him, his makeup job is so weak that he becomes more comical than imposing or frightening. Now, I love Kane Hodder as Jason, but the acting in this movie is absolutely bottom shelf. There are a few decent visual effects, yet there are more than enough cheesy effects to counter and totally eclipse the good.This is the 2nd ""mulligan"" of the series: along with part 5, fans will wish they could simply remove them from the series and forever forget them.",2
"Jason, the living, breathing essence of evil, is back for another fierce fling. Tracked down and blown to bits by a special FBI task force, everyone now assumes that he's finally dead. But everyone is wrong. Jason has been reborn with the ability to assume the identity of anyone he touches. The terrifying truth is that he could be anywhere. Or anybody.One of the weaker installments in the franchise. The one bright spot in the film is actor Steven Williams (who would later play the role of ""Mr. X"" in the series ""The X-Files""). His character is interesting, and he plays it with energy and comedic touches.",2
THIS MOVIE IS THE WORST OF THE SERIES. JASON IS ONLY IN 2 SCENES THE BEGINNING AND THE END. THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE MOVIE HE IS POSSESSING PEOPLE AND CONTROLLING THEM FROM INSIDE THEIR BODIES. THIS MOVIE BLOWS PART 5 IS BETTER AND TAT BLOWED TO 5 IS BETTER CUS THEY ACTUALLY HAD A JASON LOOK ALIKE AND U FIRST THINK ITS JASON. I GAVE THIS MOVIE 2 STARS CUS OF THE AMOUNT OF GORE IN IT.,2
"First off I LOVE THE ""FRIDAY THE 13th"" FILMS!!, but as a movie fan this is BY FAR the WORST ""Friday"" film off them all, turning one of the most popular slashers of all time into what looks like one of the ""ALIENS"" after bursting through a chest and then having him switching from body to body ala ""Invasion of the body snatchers"" has to be ONE OF THE WORST IDEAS IN MOVIE HISTORY!! About the only thing that was semi enjoyable in the film was the end and I wont spoil it for you guys that havent seen it. I gave it 2 stars, one because the movie is watchable and the other because im a fan of the series. If your a collector of the ""Friday"" films its a no-brainer to get it to complete your collection. If you're looking for a good horror flick...STAY AAWWAAYYYY!!!",2
"Now I know that horror flicks aren't supposed to make alot of sense, but there comes a point where leaving too much unexplained and unaccounted for detracts from the quality of the movie. And that is the case with this film--how does Jason have a long-lost sister? What is the Necronomicon doing in the house? What's with the bounty hunter and his special dagger? Not very well thought out.",2
I watched the special features of Jason goes to hell. They said this is the end of all Jason movies. Ya ok.... do they really think the way they ended it no one is going to think of a way for him to come out of hell. If Jason was able to come from hell to grab his hooky mask and laugh about it. I'm pretty sure that mean's he will or can come back from hell. But nice try on trying to end this movie. Which by the way is a big change out of all Jason movies. What is the big changes in this movie compared to all the others? Well Jason is able to kill living in different body's.,2
"this movie was almost as bad as ""Jason X"" (quite possibly the WORST sequel to come out of any movie ever - and ive seen major league 2: back to the minors).this movie forces you to sit through an hour and a half of boring ""weve-seen-this-before"" horror movie cliches only to find the best bit of the whole thing is the last 30 seconds.however, if youre a die-hard fan of the friday the 13th series (which means you should have seen this years ago) and actually had to pay to see Jason X, this movie is for you - but im sure youll agree with me.",2
What's wrong with the screen? It's too bright. They were REALLY struggling to keep FRIDAY13 alive by this point. So much so that Paramount gave up on it. It's their own fault for not making them better than they should have been. My Friday the 13th rewrites will be 10 times better I promise you that.,2
"I will have to admit, this film is pretty good but they stole their idea. The film ""The Hidden"" was just like this. Friday The 13TH Part 9: Jason Goes To Hell was a copied movie. The Hidden was a great movie. The Hiddden was made in 1987, Friday The 13th Part 9 was made in 1993 so you can tell the producer of Friday The 13TH stole their great idea. Friday The 13th Part 9 is alike to The Hidden because they have this killer that hops from body to body by spitting a snake alien thing into their mouth and then the one with the snake alien thing is the new killer. ...",2
"People that give this movie a good review,forget what the story is about.You can't follow the same storyline for 7 parts and then screw it up with Manhattan and this scifi bodysnatching garbage.Two stars for begining and ending and it's apart of the greatest horror legacy,so I do have it in my collection.",2
"when the movie had been started for like 30 minutes i started to get confused...i wasnt completely dissapointed though...it was an alright movie, its just so different than the other F13's...I wasnt expecting something like this...but the main question i thought about was ""why did the doctor eat jasons heart""?...I mean, thats just plain dumb n stupid n such...i didnt like the idea of them putting jason into other bodies..it was dumb..I could have made a WHOLE lot better F13 movie than that...Its like i said...This movie is not all THAT bad (its pretty bad though)...i wouldnt recommend renting it..",2
"This movie is a nonsensical barage of noise and gross-out ugliness. Why they bother to pretend that this is the same ""Jason"" as in the original Friday, I don't know. I guess they think the audience is pretty dumb. By 1993, it was apparent that 'they don't make 'em like they used to.' The 80s horror flicks were so much better, less loud, less obnoxious, and more fun. This is trash.",2
"Though I like th Friday The 13th series, this one STINKS!!!!!Jason is a little worm transfering from body to body. Jason is only in the beginning and the end. Though it stinks, A Nightmare On Elm Street's Freddy Krueger makes a special appearence at the end by sticking his right hand, ( The one with the claws ) out of the ground and pulls Jason's hockey mask to Hell with him. So, only if you are a die hard fan you should , if not, don't see it. You are wasting your money.",2
"Please understand that this is NOT the orange Michael W. Smith Worship CD translated directly onto a DVD. This DVD is a compilation of the Worship and Worship Again CDs. Make sure you research the songs contained in this DVD, so you will not be disappointed, as I was.",2
"This DVD is disappointing to say the least. From the moment Michael enters the arena through the crowd I feel like I'm watching carefully scripted theatre rather than worship to the King of Kings. The focus here is Michael W. Smith, ""Worship Artist"". Michael appears stiff and very conscious of the cameras, his movements choreographed. The direction is average, lacking inspiration and repetitive. The only moment I felt my spirit engage was during Awesome God. If you want a truly amazing worship experience on DVD I suggest you avoid this. You're better off buying Hillsong's ""Blessed"" or Christian City Church, Oxford Falls' new album ""Lift"".",2
I ordered the widescreen for my wife's birthday and received the full screen. The movie is good but I'm not happy about the error.,2
"If neither Sandra Bullock nor Hugh Grant (to a lesser extent) can save the thinnest and most damningly simple movie, then it's safe to say that it is indeed junked. Unlike one of the other Mark Lawrence movies featuring Bullock, 'Miss Congeniality,' Bullock doesn't get much of a chance to show off her screwball splendor. Instead, what we get from both leads is a tired effort at replaying what movie audiences love most about them, which is one joke too many and one too lame already. But, if all else fails in a screwball romance, you can at least be assured of eye candy with this pair.",2
"I gave it two stars and i was being kind. Simply because I saw ""the ring"" and gave it one star and did enjoy it more than that. But this movie is so predictable. Maybe its because I've seen this before. yes it was in ""you've got mail."" Two rich and professional people who in the begining dispise each other while one of them is in a relationship with another. About half way through the protagonist who's in the relationship miraculously drops the 'lover-we-never-see' and realizes how much she loves our other main character. But they save it all for the end with the big ""oh i've always felt this way kiss""Sadly predicatable and loaded with a lot of dry humor, this movie wasn't at all what I expected, it was worse. Sadly, Sandra's 'girl next door good looks' and Hugh's quick oneliners weren't enough to rescue this movie from its date with ...[removed store name].",2
"Sandra Bullock tries the old, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" routine for this movie. This movie was not funny at all. Even with comedian, Robert Klein in a supporting role, it doesn't take off. Hugh Grant is wasted in his role. Overall, this is a dud.",2
"TWO WEEKS NOTICE was a cute film but missed the mark unlike its predecessor Maid In Manhattan which was more real and entertaining. Sandra Bullock (Miss Congeniality, Force Of Nature) produced this film as well as stars in it. Her performance although I am sure is honest seemed a little held back playing the Harvard Lawyer fighting for the down-and-under trod.While the other side of the coin, there is the rich millionaire played by Hugh Grant (Nine Months, Notting Hill) was a more outgoing, non-caring and flamboyant wisp that almost didn't match to well with Sandra.It ran a little slow and seemed much more predictable toward the end. Written and directed by Marc Lawrence (Miss Congeniality, Force Of Nature) the movie seemed very slow in pace. Robert Klein (Primary Colors, One Fine Day) gives a standout performance as Sandra's father that is worth noting.This is a good movie for the video and DVD - but theatrically it was a little disappointing. (12-31-02)",2
"Being a fan of both Miss. Sandra Bullock and Mr. Hugh Grant I looked forward to what I felt would be a fun movie, unfortunately I was to be quite disappointed.Miss Bullock's character lacked the manic energy she has frequently displayed and that this story badly needed. Her character, Lucy Kelson, had a great deal of potential, which a lackluster performance did not deliver.Mr. Grant's performance was better, but not markedly so. The `one liners' he delivered had little punch and even less humor. The chemistry between the two main characters, necessary in this type film, just didn't seem to be there.The one bright spot was Miss. Alicia Witt, as June Carter, a sort of rival to Miss Bullock's character for the affections of Mr. Grant. Her performance had energy, humor, the vulnerability of youth and at the same time the sense that she was potentially a predator manipulating the situation for personal gain.Bottom line: Even the best miss on occasion and this is one such occasion.",2
"""Two Weeks Notice"" stars two appealing people, but they have no chemistry. My dog and cat have more chemistry. Why would a lawyer (Sandra Bullock) want to work for a conceited billionaire (Hugh Grant)? Greed is a bad thing. Falling in love after countless annoying incidents just makes this movie another routine POS. There was one scene where they were playing mixed doubles in tennis and I was truly ashamed with their athleticism. I could've probably beat all of them with my hand tied behind my back because I'm the king of handicap matches. Oh well. This movie really doesn't grab your attention and makes you wish you spent your money on something with substance, like a twinkie.",2
"Let's be honest this is as [weak] a comedy as you can imagine but having said that, Hugh Grant is funny, even with this script and Sandra Bullock is cute. I would never recommend you actually buy this but a rental on an evening when you IQ are asleep and there is nothing else on, then it is okay.",2
but I don't like Sandra doing her insane bouncing ball impersonation. seen her doing it in several movies and it really gets on my nerve.,2
"Love the movie, but beware of this DVD. 3 times I've ordered it from Amazon (twice in a Slipcase and once in a Keepcase, and all 3 DVD's skipped, the video broke up, scenes kept repeating, etc... And yes, I used the Memorex CD cleaner on the DVD player without any change, and no, none of my numerous other commercially purchased DVD's demonstrate this problem. Two Weeks Notice is the ONLY one. So my suggestion is to stick to the VCR version.",2
"OK, this review is going to be fairly short. I have to say that this movie could have been great, but unfortunately falls flat at the end. The first half of this movie is great, Hugh Grant is hilarious and Sandra Bullock manages to be cute and intelligent at the same time, and these characters are completely believable. Grant has a line where he says ""My life is a lot like Monopoly"" ( which had me rolling ) and sadly the movie is a lot like Monopoly, in that it is a 'board' game and I found myself very 'bored' in the last half of the movie.This movie is hilarious enough in the first half that I watch just that part then turn it off, because I know what is coming. The last act has them coming together and confessing their love for each other, and at that point it feels completely rushed and unbelievable, like this is the end, so they love each other, ummm, roll credits. I recommend the first half highly, then just skip the rest.",2
"Sometimes a bubblegum movie is old bubblegum, tired and chewy and not very sweet. This movie has all the pieces but doesn't have any zing to it, any purpose. They go back and forth a little bit but they never truly convinced me that they were in love or their love was in danger. Alicia Witt, a superb actress didn't really have much to do in thsi film and Hugh Grant's bumbling charm boy routine is wearing thin.I'm not sure about Bullock, she's filling a niche I'm sure. Doing films that appeal to her, that she gets paid a lot for, that help employ a lot of people. But I'm not qute sure if she's developing further along as an actress, if she's willing to take a risk and do something edgey or different or challenging. She just seems to be the best at the romantic comedy pairings movie of the season. Hopefully she'll start getting better choices.",2
"Fresh of watching ""About A Boy"" I felt like Hugh Grant could do no wrong, so despite less than stellar reviews I decided give ""Two Weeks Notice"" a shot, which was a mistake. While there are some comedic moments, this a romantic comedy and Bullock and Grant have NO chemistry. In most of the scenes they seem only mildly aware of eachother mostly focusing on thier actions. As a result, I never felt like they should be together. Further, the plot seems to jump around. Right after getting hired, the plot leapfrogs to weeks later where Grant and Bullock are now supposed to be chumy, but I never felt it. THey seem to be tired of eachother and their action forced by the plot's simple-minded purpose. After his great romantic comedies of the 1990s, this a huge step down for Grant and even for Bullock, who mostly makes bad movies anyway. This is not worth your time because it clearly wasn't even worth the actors full attention.",2
"Hugh Grant does his enjoyable act to perfection in this movie but it is so lacking in story that it's rendered mind-numbing syrup even by romantic comedy standards. The schlock political message they attempt is embarrasing even to liberals.And let's face it, Sandra Bullock is just not a screen beauty, cute maybe, but that nasal voice that not will carry a movie.",2
"By activating the ""Two Bleeps Notice"" function in Special Features, you can access the movie outtakes when a small pink heart appears on the screen. If you don't want to have to watch the entire movie, here are the locations of each heart. I think I found them all. These are listed by hour:minute:second. 18:32, 20:04, 23:38, 24:13, 26:38, 28:14, 33:02, 37:28, 41:36, 47:16, 57:50, 1:13:01, 1:24:29.The extras on the DVD are of the usual fare, but not outstanding. The commentary is somewhat interesting, with Sanda and Hugh bantering about. The movie itself is somewhat forgettable, but is an enjoyable little film. I agree with another reviewer who said that it's like iceberg lettuce: not really great for you, but certainly not bad for you either, and you'll forget all about it an hour after it's over.",2
"Nothing worth seeing-- Grant has made some classics in this genre (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, Bridget Jones's Diary)-- but ""Two Weeks Notice"" is not a classic. It isn't even an admirable effort. It is clear he enjoyed working with Sandra Bullock offscreen, but they share little onscreen chemistry. Bullock continues her title as the ""poor man's Julia Roberts"" -- it's not a harmful film-- it's just not very good.",2
Same story we've seen many times before. You know whats going to happen just by seeing the preview. Grant is great and charming. Bullock is her same old clumsy character. Supporting cast provides laughs as well. All right if you have nothing better to see.,2
"I've always been a big fan of Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock and I was really looking forward to seeing the two of them together. I sincerely wanted to enjoy myself, but the one thing you heard ALL the critics agree upon about this film turned out to be absolutely true-- It's about as ordinary and unoriginal as a romantic comedy can be. The conflicting question among all the critics was this: Were Bullock and Grant able to turn a rather dull movie into something good? I didn't think so unfortunately. Heck, I don't even think the pairing of Superman and Wonder Woman could have saved this film. It certainly doesn't compare well to Grants previous picture, ABOUT A BOY.My recommendation is not to waste your money on this movie unless you're a fan of these two actors... My final review is two and a half stars... Just too average and not many laughs.",2
"Sandra Bulluck (who is my favorite actress, by the way) never looked good in this movie and the chemistry between her and Hugh Grant was missing. Neither her character nor Hugh's was particularly like-able and the ending was, of course, predictable, but lacking in real emotion. Wait for cable.",2
"This water dispenser works just fine and my dogs have no problem drinking from it. I have a problem with cleaning it, however. I keep it outside and in the summer months, it will develop a green mold or algae inside the jug and also in the bowl. Since there is only the small narrow spout for an opening, there is no way to get any kind of brush in there to clean it. I ended up having to soak it in bleach water to remove the green stuff inside.",2
"I started off using this as the primary water dish for my pets, however within a very short amount of time, I'd have to dump out all the water to clean it because a nasty, clear slime would start growing in the dish-YUCK!I decided to start using a pet water fountain as their primary water source, because it's constantly moving and there's a filter, it stays clean a bit longer.However, this is great for cats, if you're away on vacation. But, because of the slime factor, I don't like to use this unless I have to.",2
"This waterer is a great concept, but does have some drawbacks. For starters, one of my dogs is scared to death of it and wont come near it because when the water level in the bowl gets low it gurgles just like a water cooler at work. The first time it happened she was drinking out of it and it freaked her out and now wont go near it. The other dog is just fine with it, but then again he's deaf, so the gurgle doesn't bother him. lol. The other issue i had with this is just like all water bowls, it gets dirty. so you still have to clean it as often as you would any other water bowl, but it's a bit more cumbersome having to take the big jug off, clean the bowl and but the jug back on. So, if your dog isn't afraid of the noise it makes and you don't mind the extra hassle cleaning it, it's great. Otherwise, just get a large bowl; that's what i ended up having to do.",2
"While it functions great as a pet waterer, the Microban does not work very well. We have to clean it every time we fill it (used with dogs). It is only a few months old and will get green over several days. We contacted the company and got virtually no support--just a note that we may need to clean it occasionally. No kidding. That's what we told them. So good waterer, terrible customer support, and does not stay clean very well.",2
"As others have noted, this system works exceedingly well up until the time that the bottle develops a crack -- & make no mistake, the plastic used for the bottle is so brittle that it will eventually crack if it is even slightly mishandled. The ""antibacterial"" aspect could be better as well. I have had some success in using RTV to seal cracks, but eventually you're going to have to replace the unit.",2
"Brand new and bottom broke. very expensive as well. Too bad I cannot send back. I had it for alot of animals outside. My chicken coop caught winter electrical fire, so bottle got burnt anyway.",2
"I bought the LeBistro Portion Control Feeder and for the first 12 feeding times at breakfast and lunch it worked like a champ. Then it stopped delivering meals. Fortunately I was aware of it - I bought it for when we went away for weekends, but wanted to be sure the cat wouldn't starve while we were gone so set it up to feed. The Waterer I bought is fine. It's just a little water cooler. I wish it were a little more solid though.Back to the Feeder - I had to reset the whole thing twice before it worked. I had the right times and portions but just didn't drop the food. I'm going to give it another week or so before I ask to have it replaced.When it works it's great - good design for the cost. Pretty easy to set up.But intermittent behavior defeats the purpose of being able to leave with confidence.",2
"I used this waterer for several months. I had always rinsed it out with fresh water before refilling it, and scrubbed the bottom part. Within 2 days, the bottom part would always start growing an orange slime on it, and I smelled the plastic water-holder part, and it smells like algae (although none is visible). I feel awful for using this product for my cat, and have switched to a regular bowl that I can thoroughly clean daily. I am only keeping the automatic water dish in the event I'm away a day or two. Other than that, DO NOT USE FOR DAILY WATER.",2
"My new cat 4 mo. old could see bottom of spout-nipple-water exit point and kept reaching in to pull on it,leading too a huge mess as it then pawed at the water in the bowl as i guess it was it the way.digging might better explain as it threw the water out of the tray/pan onto the floor as fast as it could (yes it is now funny).Only saying so because last one only had a small hole for water to come out of into pool/drinking area.Only needed a new bottle but was just as cheap to get new assembly.re-inventing the wheel in this case did not work with my cat who has now become bored with it and finally just drinks out of it.hope this helps.",2
"This album was originally released in 1968, when Regis was Joey Bishop's sidekick. It was Regis's only commercially released album, although he later recorded some albums that he released on his own. Regis had an okay singing voice, but it was certainly nothing special. Also, his style was hopelessly outdated by 1968. The arrangements of these standards are incredibly corny, too. But a few of these songs are good for a laugh. The highlight of the album is the end of ""Toot, Toot, Tootsie/Baby Face"", where Regis yells out ""Sock it to, 'em, Tootsie!"". Now, that's (unintentional) comedy!",2
As much as I love the show - I find the price of this DVD collection to be insane!,2
I wasn't able to give the actual box for the dvd as part of the gift because the top was ripped off. The status was that it was just like new. This is not just like new if the box is broken. Otherwise the dvds look great and not scratched.,2
"so far, still watching the first season. But can tell you that by only watching the first show i would give the season a 2. the first show of any season should grab your attention, and they do that but they just dont do a very good job at keeping it. In the first show, theres death, closet ""hook ups"", gay soft core love scenes and just plain drama, wonder what the rest of the shows are going to be like. If you are into the slow paced ironic drama then this show is for you.",2
"This isn't as much a review as much a question. Are they releasing Season 1 again next month but not on BluRay, why???",2
"Based on the other reviews, I am in the minority. This series just didn't do anything for me. I never got into the characters or even felt like i couldn't wait for the next episode. I don't know what it was, it was just boring. I never watched past the first season so i don't know if it got better or what but there is just better shows out there.",2
"This book gives good coverage of Oracle's JDBC implementation. That is about as far as it goes. This is just too close to being documentation. When purchasing books on a specific technology, I am looking for the author's insight. Specific things the author learned while working with it. Give me best practices, suggestions, things to avoid, etc. Tell me what I won't learn from Oracle's docs, don't just rewrite them.",2
"A look at the DVD cover conveys a message to the red blooded male that when seeing this movie you will be seeing some skin. If that's all you're looking for then you'll give it a higher rating than I have. I found disappointment as the story had potential but hindered itself by taking avenues from reality to far fetched situations without needing to. There is some suspense, and enough skin to keep it away from the kids, but overall it missed it's potential.",2
"Aside from anything else that is good or bad, routine or entertaining about this film, I can't be the only one who was completely unable to get past the fact that, in the big murder scene, both the hero and the victim act more stupefyingly idiotic than any characters in the lowest-grade teen slasher ever made.",2
"Because I KNOW you didn't see any amazing acting, incredible plot twists or X-rated sex scenes in Body Double. This film is watchable if nothing else is on; I'll give it that. But ""gripping?"" ""DePalma's masterpiece?"" ""a classic?"" Only if you took a LOT of drugs before you saw it. It's typical DePalma; in other words, a Hitchcock ripoff he manages to make a few notches above putrid.",2
There's much better Heep Compilations ('Running all night with the lion'... Please!!!) Don't waste your money.,2
This is a good classic rock cd with the exception that stealin one of their best songs is not on this or their greatest hits. The best song on here is Easy Livin so this is a cd only for a die hard Uriah Heep fan.,2
"With the exception of the catchy ""Easy Livin'"" I found this to be an unmemorable compilation of rock songs.",2
"The author is obviously a highly skilled pilot and has extensive experience. His recounting of the progress in the airline industry is very interesting. I bought the book expecting to read about progress in dealing with the problems encountered in adapting new technology and adjusting to the obviously over crowded skies. While the author states (over and over) that both are very real problems, he does not offer much in terms of what is being done to address the pilot's ever expanding workload. He seems merely intent on convincing the reader that the industry and the FAA are out to get the pilot. This book is not so much a study of human factors as a pilot's complaints about an industry that probably somehow just became something he no longer cared to be a part of.",2
"I'll echo some of the other reviews on here: the navigation is ridiculous, as is the ""easter egg"" hunt. With most DVD players ability to directly access any tracks, easter eggs aren't cool anymore. And one of my favorite videos ""A View To A Kill"" got the opening Bond gunbarrel and the beginning of the song chopped off (I'll assume it's due to licensing issues). FYI, it's not much better on the AVTAK movie DVD either: there, the video is unedited but it's cropped at the black bars so the floating cameras get cropped as well, plus it's worse quality than the Greatest version.For a band that single-handedly revolutionized the music video world and put MTV on the map, this is a shameful and appalling DVD. Hopefully there will be definitive DVD in the future that will include My Own Way, Careless Memories, and all the other ones that got left out, not to mention proper remastering and a better interface and package design. Hope springs eternal.",2
I expected a little more from this brand. The case fits so well and protects the phone. The sides of this case discoloured within the first two weeks of using and now looks very average. Would not purchase again.,3
The set is fine overall for the price. The metal on all knives is rather thin and somewhat flexible. Not the best quality but suitable for home use. The wood block holds all the knives but maybe could have been a darker wood. Like previously mentioned for the price its fine. How they will hold up is a test of time.,3
"This is the lamest product design ever. It does not store easily as advertised because all the stuff that comes with it doesn't fit in it. Not even the manual! I couldn't even figure out how to get it back in the box it came in. So now I have to buy a box to put it all in, so I don't lose pieces and parts. Very, very, very disappointed. This problem could have been easily avoided with a better design for the product, or if they included a plastic box just big enough to store everything in.The cutting area is pretty small, so you have to cut your produce or whatever in half or so, so that it will fit on the cutting area and you can close the unit to do the cutting. Again, lame!!! Again, the problem could be easily avoided by making the product larger in general. That said, it does cut as advertised, at least with the ""garnish blade"".I bought this specifically for making Pico. That means using the small and maybe the large dicing blades. The goal was to have a quicker and easier way to do it, rather than using my big kitchenaid mixer with the food processing attachment. That device does a wonderful job by the way, but our kitchen is very small so my wife makes me store it in the basement. My goal with THIS product was to have something I could keep in the kitchen cabinet.I didn't have everything I needed to make pico tonight, so I used it to make fajitas. I cut onions and three different kinds of peppers with it. For the onion, I had to cut that in half to make it fit in the cutting area so it would cut. For the big bell peppers, I had to cut them in half, and then in half then other way. I really expected better.Overall, the plastic is decent quality for the purpose, as far as I can tell. It also cleaned up fairly easily.I can't comment on its various other functions yet, as I just got the thing yesterday! But that didn't stop Amazon from asking for a review, so here it is.",3
"The product is not heavy but still will serve the purpose for our event. However, no screws were included and need to find replacements.;",3
Came dented and didn’t have enough time before my gathering to get a new one. Otherwise it works fine,3
"I expect a fluffy quilt. This is a flat blanket, nothing more.",3
"I love the scent, but the scent didn’t last. I’ve shaken it and added more stick, flipping everyday. I wish it was better.",3
The media could not be loaded. The color and shelf itself is pretty. I expected to be sturdier for prize. The concept is smart but they needed to add possibly another bar within the shelf to actually support better. Limited use for shelf because when adding additional items the shelf starts to lower in front part and looks like items will fall off and it’s not flush against the wall. I expected more considering price. Very cute design and great if hanging lighter items then books or albums. Great if for Knick knacks. Would not repurchase for my intended use.,3
"When I saw this online, I thought it was cute and decided to buy this as a Christmas gift for my in-laws. However, after receiving it, I don’t think the quality is too good and I’m really disappointed in the magnets. The concept is nice, but the magnets I received are all marked up and chipped. Very disappointing.",3
It's a nice looking decoration. Plastic and smaller than expected. I should have read the complete description but skipped ahead when it was on sale.,3
A bit smaller than I expected,3
"It's a very good computer, very pleasing to the eye. The only problem I have with it is that it's incompatible with the windows 11 upgrade. I honestly thought I grabbed the windows 11 PC but unfortunately I didn't. Besides that little hiccup, it runs smoothly.",3
"Cpu cooler is bad but the pc is good value for the discount, also it is very difficult if you want to upgrade it since the specs are propierty",3
"It's good enough for gaming. RAM, not the best—you could buy more yourself. But looking back, given all of these components this thing is super overpriced. You could build your own for half the price with the same components. Either look for another product or just build your own.",3
For the customers: this is what you should know it does not have a Optical drive a.k.a. DVD player they should put that in the description saying it doesn’t have one but it’s not there it doesn’t say it does or doesn’t either way I want to use it for other things other than gaming the loads really fast in the Internet is really fast when it’s loaded the games take less time to download to my previous computer I played breath edge and it works fine just got hiccups here and there but you can upgrade.this the other problem is there’s no option or any way to put a optical drive in not a single port and that really ticks me off if you didn’t have one it should be advertise not having one and I would’ve went with the $600 one with the warranty about 700 which only had three fans and 250 Megabytes. The only other option is to go in a sternal optical drive a.k.a. DVD player CD player that’s also a pain in the ass you have to make sure that it’s able to read not just burn learned that the hard way make sure you read the descriptions and look for what is and what isn’t mentioned.To the manufacturer: this is borderline false advertisement you should really mention that it doesn’t have one if you’re not going to install it or even an option for someone who buys it to put one in themselves not everyone streams games online some people still get hardcopies that’s something to take in mine I don’t have a problem with the look I do have a problem with not seeing or mentioning certain things in your description for future references this would be best if an external hard drive doesn’t work I will be getting a full refund and I’m going with a different company very disappointed.,3
For old games 100% good but when you got some récent games you gonna surfer. But you know i run obs and my games Steel pretty descent bit it works,3
So everything arrived in time and everything worked BUT the monitor. Like the monitor flashes. Which is sad. My son got creative and used an old tv to connect everything. But keyboard quality is good and everything else but the monitor is good.,3
Looks good. Very compact. Does not upgrade and very limited in what games you can play.So i returned it. Still waiting for my refund. Was sent back over 1 month ago.,3
"I have the series S 500gig from when they came out. The 1tb unit should be just as fast “actually faster” to load since it’s a better read/write SSD BUT ITS NOT.

And 90 day warranty when I payed for the year warranty but it’s not transferable or refundable. GOING TO STICK WITH PC GAMING, consoles are just not worth it.",3
It works plays the games but it does like to turn on its own when not it use. Has turned off on its own while using it but not when playing a game.other than that works great,3
"The build quality of this stand is excellent and the lights look great, there are just two issues with it. Firstly, this rubber appendage sticking out at me. I have a wireless mouse so have literally no use for this, I'm able to remove it but now have this ugly gaping hole instead. I may be able to ignore it or try and cover it, but for a premium stand this is a bit daft.However the most irritating problem is that the stand doesn't retain the colour I last set it to. I use a docking station and frequently switch between machines, and every time I do I have to keep pressing the button until I get back to my colour.It may sound like a petty complaint but this isn't the cheapest stand on the market and this is a really stupid problem to have. If my cheap and crappy £10 mousepad from China can do it then I don't see why this can't.",3
"For the price and renewed original Xbox Console, you might think you'd be getting a good deal. Little did I know that the pop-open tray couldn't slide out on the first day of gaming my favorite game, that being the ""Counter-Strike"" Shooter game for the Original Xbox. So I say to myself: either I leave the Disc inside the Xbox, play CS, and make a promise to myself not to break the disk tray even more. Turns out the console works, but no CD Pop-Out capability. Still works fine. Dare I remove that disc for a different game from the Disk tray, and I would be asking for a no longer working Xbox. however the good news I have to share with you all is that I can still play Counter-Strike on the renewed Xbox I ordered, but I can't play other games because I'm too afraid the tray might get stuck and possibly break. So a word to the wise ""If it's broken, but still works, then don't break it anymore."" I guess the Xbox has been around for a very long time. Meaning old products come with defects or some kind of technical problem that can't be fixed. But on a good note, Whenever I look at my turned off Xbox, and see the game controller connected to the console, I get the feeling it's telling me to load up Counter-Strike for one more round. Looking at it, makes me want to call this console, the Counter-Strike Xbox!",3
"After a few days with the phone, I can say that it's pretty sub-par. It's definitely a step up from my previous device, but I honestly expected more from a 5G Galaxy device in 2024.The camera is nice, and the body is solid. The screen is beautiful, visually, but is slow and unresponsive, at times refusing to register taps and swipes.I've owned Galaxy devices before, but the Samsung bloatware on this one takes the cake. Dozens of apps are preloaded that you'll have to either disable or uninstall to get some of the precious memory back, and OneUI is aggressively intrusive, causing compatibility and sign in issues with just about everything you want to use.I suppose this is a case of get-what-you-pay-for, but the user experience seems oddly frustrating, given the promised five years of support.This phone has reaffirmed that the Samsung device environment is not for me.",3
"Product arrived nicely packaged and not damaged with all parts in place. After I hooked everything up I went to open the disc tray and it would not open. This was the exact same issue I had on my previous Xbox 360. After fighting with the disc tray I was able to get open.Xbox would repeatedly “freeze” and become unresponsive. Only way to correct issue was to unplug power.Do yourself a favor and either don’t buy, or make sure you get a warranty. I was able to return mine and the seller was very easy to work with on the refund process.",3
Not enough storage to keep 10 games on it and expansion storage is as expensive as console and external hard drive you have to move games back and forth to play,3
"After purchasing the ""3 Tube"" lamp; I went on to get the ""Shark"" and the ""Jellyfish"" lamps and neither had the USB or battery power sources. Also they didn't have the touch button to change the colors. Still a cool little light sculptures but I got a definite sense of El Cheapo. If this doesn't bother you then go ahead with the purchase. For my use, the USB &a battery setup was a major consideration, and I probably would not have bought the other 2 had I known, but all 3 models were in the same product description.",3
This product looks nice but I find it too bright to be used as a night light. I could also not find a dimmer switch that worked to dim this lamp.,3
"His foot ripped off, leaking sand everywhere. No way to fix it.",3
"Was very hopeful that this product would reduce the coffee stains on my teeth. After applying the toothpaste and scrubbing and scrubbing, I couldn't get the purple off that had stained the tartar in between my teeth. It took a couple more intense sessions to fade the purple. There was some fading on the stains on the surface of the teeth but didn't want to look like a Halloween ghoul so did not continue to use.",3
is ok not what expected,3

Great product.,3
"This toothpaste gets your teeth clean. I find that other natural toothpastes don’t get your teeth as scrubbed clean like the usual Colgates, Crest, etc. toothpastes, however, this one did. The purple color was did not stain your teeth and it actually lathers up well and turns white. The taste wasn’t off-putting and wasn’t too mild nor too overwhelming. I don’t know if it whitened my teeth much, but one of my friends told me that for teeth whitening toothpastes to work you actually have to let them sit on your teeth for at least 15 minutes each time you brush. I am trying to implement that into my daily routine. For the price, and compared to other whitening toothpastes, I don’t think the price is worth it.",3
"So, I have been using this toothpaste for about 2 months now. Not really seeing any whitening effects, but otherwise really like it. Nice flavor, gentle on my gums, teeth feel clean. No bad morning breath. But this is dang expensive to not whiten my teeth. Likely won't reorder at this price",3
"It’s ok, it I like the pastier ones better. This is the equivalent of foamed hand soap as opposed to regular hand soap. Will look for a different one next time",3
"Used with both Crest and Colgate toothpastes. Instead of a screw-tight fit, the cap will begin to just spin. That said, if you tighten to just before it starts spinning, then it work fine. Just be aware that it's essentially still an open tube so toothpaste will dry a bit over time.",3
Doesn’t fit my grandsons toothpaste tube,3
"The formula definitely offers a very temporary Whiteness to teeth, but sadly does not last further than a few minutes.There is also no cleaning component within the foam.Although it does taste quite nice and gives an immediate whiteness, the product does not live up to the hype.",3
I didn’t notice a difference with my teeth. Not pleased.,3
"It’s not “unflavored,” it’s sweetened with sorbitol. My bad, should have read the ingredient list. Otherwise, I like it: a little foam, a good clean feel to my mouth.",3
"Usually love Colgate, but this toothpaste has a runny consistency and my daughter gets it all over the place. She loves the flavor, but I am not a fan.",3
Lovely taste.. Kids love it.. But oh my the price is ridiculous. Won't be buying this again.,3
Got this after watching videos and seeing reviews of how great it works. I have been using it for over a week now and see no difference in the whitening of my teeth. The paste also globs up on my teeth and doesn't distribute evenly. Don't trust purple tooth paste.,3
"This was too gritty, got stuck between my teeth and I needed to floss and rinse after brushing. The flavor was good and my teeth felt clean but i just can't get over how gritty it is.",3
"I barely got into toothpaste tablets and tried out NOBS really like it so I seen these at a better price, but very brittle and my mouth didn’t feel so clean after. I would use 3 tablets just to feel clean.",3
"The media could not be loaded. My ear canals must be very clean, because nothing came out while using this, except the irrigation water. I heated the water to 98° F. Never use cold or hot water to irrigate your ears. It should always be around body temperature. This product has 4 streams of water and different levels of pressure. The pressure was good, but no ear wax came out. I really wanted to like this, but after using it, my ears actually felt plugged. Two hours later and lots of q-tips trying to soak up the moisture, my ears still feel plugged. From now on, I will leave ear irrigation to the professionals.",3
works ok doesnt have as much pressure as i hoped however i do understand why too much and water would shoot out the my other ear,3
"I think I was expecting more because of the brand. It would be nice if the chambers marked which ways the batteries went in. The product doesn’t feel solid. Seems cheaply made and, it’s really loud. It would also be nice if there were a carry case or bag for the brush heads.",3
"I have mixed feelings about this ear wax camera. I thought maybe I would be able to see down my ear canal to the eardrum, but that is not possible because the canal curves. Also, the scraper sits in front of the camera and would need to be way down the canal before the camera could see. I don’t feel this is safe to put down the ear canal. The metal scrapers included with the kit are definitely not safe. Don’t put this stuff down your ear canal! Leave that to doctors.Now the mixed feeling part is because the camera is actually pretty cool. You can see things really close up. It functions like a low power microscope displaying on your phone. I ran it across my skin and could see every pore and every hair and every blemish in super close detail. Creepy looking honestly. I was able to see around the sides of my teeth close up. I could see the individual pixels on my TV screen. You get the idea. The app takes pictures and video too.",3
"This does work, but only for a few minutes before the water runs out. I will only get it out for small jobs. I personally really don't like having to stop and wait for the cool down and then the heat up to only get to work for a couple of minutes.That being said, I have never used a steamer before and I was able to quickly understand what to do to get this working. The instructions are pretty well written. Not perfectly clear, but good enough.The included measuring cup is very convenient as it is marked with the maximum amount of water you can put in.I tested mine on buildup in a shower. I tried it out on glass shower doors and on the bottom of the tub and on some grout. I did need to learn to go slower with it and let the steam do its job. I do think I will get better at it over time. If I can be patient enough to wait through the process.",3
"I bought this to help me clean my showers because of my hands. It is easy to use, but it does not clean the way I was hoping. The Speeds are ok, but the top speed you really have to hold on tight. Also I had to put a lot of pressure to scrub, still it did not clean the build up in my shower. I would like to have at least one cleaning head with harder bristles for the more harder cleaning. After I charged it the first time I've used it 3 times for about 15 mins. and it's still working so I guess the battery is pretty good. I think I'm going to keep it to wash my cars or some mild cleaning.",3
If I could have tested this product before buying I would not have purchased. It doesn’t do a great job and cleaning the base boards like advertised. It doesn’t bend at the bottom so it’s hard to maneuver to me. It also keeps coming detached from the bottom while using. Not my favorite! May return.,3
It is easy to apply with your hands but I prefer using a small plastic spoon. It dries well and it's easy to peel off leaving the skin firm. Its gentle on the skin and gets the dead skin off. The only bad thing is the freshly applied gel sting the eyes a little bit at first when it's less than 1 in from your eyes. After a sec it's OK. Would prob test another peel off mask before buying again.,3
"My skin feels nice enough after using this mask but there are two big cons that make me hesitant to reorder this.1. You need to use a fair bit to create a thick enough layer that doesn't break off into bits while removing it.2. It has a very strong, glue like smell. It's really overpowering and having to put so much on your face doesn't help.I'll keep using it but I'm not sure if the results I gain are significant enough to justify the cost and cons.",3
"I tried to make a picture of how it feels to look through these things. As a novelty, they work well, but for any serious reading, the tiny size of the viewing windows are a constant detriment. I would recommend you keep looking for a horizontal reading solution. The technology is not there yet. Larger prisms, a wider nose bridge, and more plastic material around the frame edges would improve these a lot.The prisms are quite small, measuring about 27mmx44mmx32mm; apparently, you're hard-pressed to find any silvered prisms larger than this, which is a real pity. With larger prisms and a larger viewing window, these could be great for reading books from a comfortable distance, and not with the text in line with ones nipples.This means that the actual portion of my field of view that the image takes up is not even 40%. This might be able to be improved, if the nose bridge were not so extremely narrow so that you cannot slide them all the way on your face. I do not have an exceptionally large nose, or maybe I do; I cannot put these on my face nearly far enough to close out all the exterior sights and shadows. I have worn large over-the-glasses shades before, and they shut out the light nicely around the edges of my vision. These are too small to do so. They are perched on my nose like Ben Franklin reading spectacles.There is ghosting on the viewing image, like when you put your face very near a mirror and can see a slight... ghostly image. This is probably unavoidable due to the nature of light refracting through a prism, but still detracts from the reading experience considerably when there is a superimposed mirror ghost image over the bottom half of the book. I have tried to show this in my mockup photo.There is an upside-down image above each eye, which is even more distracting than the superimposed ghost image. This does not seem to be avoidable either.They fit over my glasses nicely, which I didn't expect. That is nice, because in contrast to one reviewer's husband's experience, I CANNOT see in focus through these without my glasses.The sides of the prisms are shiny, and having three large vertical whitish bars is also rather distracting when reading. There might not be any way to make these less obtrusive, but a matte finish or different color or angle might improve this aspect.",3
"These are the best readers I've come across yet, being autofocus is the best! The only problem I have is the quality of the plastic in the frames because they don't last they crack and fall apart so the price reflects that by many it's still worth the money.",3
"What does auto focus means? Not what I was thinking, these are simple reading glasses.",3
Good for reading,3
The glasses are very heavy and not real comfortable but the idea of them is still good.,3
"It does work, but it does mess with youMakes you feel weirdLittle dizzyI just didn’t like how I felt after I used it for a little bit",3
"I was actually excited to try this item, simply for the novelty of such a product and also because, well, let’s face it… I’m lazy. I’ve only used these glasses once or twice while laying bed so I could watch TV while also reading during the commercials, and I don’t think I’ll be keeping them because they aren’t really good for long-term, practical use.As far as ‘periscope’ vision goes, the glasses didn’t seem to provide as steep of an angle as I was expecting, therefore I was a bit disappointed.It was certainly interesting to try, but it felt a bit awkward wearing them and it was disorienting/dizzying and almost nauseating for me to have them on for more than a few minutes at a time. The glasses don’t exactly provide the crispest vision since you’re viewing a reflection of an image, so naturally it’s a bit discombobulating.And of course anyone wearing these looks absolutely ridiculous – I felt like I looked like Mr. Krabs from SpongeBob 😂So in summary, this would make a great gag gift or stocking stuffer as long as you don’t take it too seriously or expect too much from it.",3
"- Light & works as intended.- Though the area the glass covers is small, so I’m able to see surrounding area, which is kinda annoying.",3
"I was hopeful that these would work well. I wanted to put them on a couple sunglasses that do no have a bifocal magnification. With all honesty - I was disappointed. I followed the directions as given - and I have a great pair of Ray Bans with flat lenses - they are just not 'sticking' like I had hoped. With a 2.50 magnification, they are also a little thicker than I had expected. They DO help with reading.Will they work in a pinch? Maybe......I'm a little nervous to wear them for fear the magnification lens will fall off. I purchased two sets - so I'll try them and see what happens. Not horribly confident, though.",3
"There are problems with multiple reflections, they're also too heavy to wear for long. A clever idea that's too hard to execute.",3
Worked great to blocking sunlight. Almost impossible to read through the dark magnifying portion of the lens.,3
I had planned on wearing these glasses only for looking at the GPS instruments in my airplaneThe glasses are as advertised but as I don't normally wear glasses I had to purchase a pair of glasses with no magnification to connect the flip glasses to. I find this uncomfortable to have to wear glasses all the time rather than only when needed.If possible I would like to order a pair of flip down glasses of the same 2.5 power that connect to the peak of a baseball style cap.Please let me know if you have a product like this in stock.ThanksRobert Moran,3
"They are OK (lenses are reasonable quality), but I managed to break the clasp on the first day. My fault, but ....",3
They were cheap but not very helpful,3
"I love this idea and use these glasses, but this is the 4th set I've owned because the batter flaps are flimsy and they break easily. These are pricy for that sort of failure, but there are incredibly useful, so I keep buying them despite their high failure rate. I gotta say, as soon as I find a more durable set of reading specs with lights I'll switch to those. These are cheaply made.",3
"Well first off I am NOT impressed by the packaging. Mine arrived wrapped in bubble wrap taped up so tightly that they had to be cut open. I was so worried I was going to cut the glasses and I came VERY close to getting the cord. Glasses are not as bright as I was hoping for/expected. Glasses are not as crisp as expected.However, they do work well for the price. I highly recommend upgrading packaging. I would give you an extra star if ANY of the above were better. But it would be too much effort to return them at this point. <shrug>",3
Nice glasses but too expensive,3
"I suppose you get what you pay for. I can use them as an extra pair but I would never order them again. I thought they were an ""oversized"" style.... they were listed as an oversized. But they're not. I like the color but that's about it.",3
These readers are light and comfortable but not meant for people who are rough on glasses. I love they are frameless but not sturdy enough for me,3
Bend easily,3
I like the sunglasses one the most because when looking at my phone in the sun I could actually see it.,3
I've been wearing progressive lenses for 30+ years. These are not progressives and I was unable to adjust.,3
"These progressive lenses really work well, but after 4 months 2 pairs (of the 3 in the order) have already broken. I've just received the second order and we'll see how long they last.",3
"I was so excited when I saw these. I spend my day swapping between .75, 1.0, (computer screens) 1.25 and 1.50 (on the work floor, First Aid applications). I also use a 2.50 for tiny work but I don't wear them regularly. I'm an EH&S manager so I'm always changing safety glasses depending on the situation with which I have to contend and most of my glasses are ANZI diopters. I thought these might be perfect for office work.These are so close but the focal length is strange. I ordered the 1.5's thinking the 1.5 would be on the bottom and digress as your eyes moved up the lens. The top part of the glasses is about a .5. I'm not sure what the middle is but I suspect it's supposed to be somewhere between a .75 to and 1. I find myself nodding up-and-down and moving back-and-forth trying to find the prefect spot for what I am doing. Even still, I can't seem to get a clear picture and the computer font can look doubled.I'm typing on my PC now (obviously) and I've just reverted back to my trusty, basic 1.0's, positioned close to the end of my nose and do the over-the-top-of-the-fame-peek when someone comes to the door.",3
"I thought they might be ""do-all"" driving glasses (distance, GPS, distance, GPS) but the grading is pretty steep so you only can use a fraction of the overall aperture for any particular thing.Oh, well. It was an idea.",3
This isn’t their fault but I was hoping to switch the prism to look up and they're firmly attached.,3
"These glasses work awesome and I wish I could have kept them. Unfortunately I have a small face and a small nose and they just kept sliding off, especially as they are on the heavy side. They did fit my step dad so they would work for some people.",3
"Not as I expected, I ordered this after reading the reviews, awful for reading.",3
Because I have cataract surgery I have new lenses in my eyes when I looked through the upper part of the glass it’s blurry I presume it’s because my lenses work better than the lenses in the glasses,3
"Basically, they took sunglasses and pasted on a little corner of bifocal. Talk about disappointing don’t waste your money.",3
Very cute but very cheap plastic.,3
This item is inferior to two SAV Sportex readers I have previously acquired. It is much less substantial with the thickest part of the frame half the size of my previous Sportex glasses. It doesn’t fit comfortably. Always feels like it is ready to fall off. Previous glasses were so comfortable it was possible to forget you were wearing them. I can’t recommend the current version of this product. Fortunately I still have one of the good Sportex glasses.,3
I've bought these before from my pharmacy and was very happy with them . These though are very flimsy in the ear area.. they cheapened them ...,3
"Not sure if its just my small head...but these are sturdy yes, which makes them hard. not flimsy glasses. They are snug on the nose and behind the ears...well more so ontop of the ears where they lay tends to be uncomfortable after a while. same with the nose piece. Other than that these are great for when you're laying down and want to read and not strain your neck",3
They a really cute bifocals but the do not darken in the sun.,3
"My first pair lasted a year when it unexpectedly broke, I had really liked them, so I bought a 2nd pair to replace it. THAT pair lasted only 5 months, when the frame broke in EXACTLY the same spot. But then the company sent we a replacement for free, so we'll see how this pair lasts.",3
"Lightweight and comfortable, but break easily. That said, its almost impossible to scratch them. I've bought multiple pairs because I keep breaking them, but I still go back to them because of its other good qualities.",3
"It seems like a better solution, right? You don't have to have a pointy 60-lb metal object hanging out your window. Easy to roll around etc.But it's not a better solution.1. In order to blow hot air out the window, the air has to come from somewhere. It's called negative pressure. This AC sucks air in from other rooms, from around your door frames etc. Warm air. So while it's cooling your room, it's also sucking warm air in from the rest of your house.2. The condenser condenses water. Unless you locate it near a drain, a unit like this has nowhere to send the water--so it just puts it back into the air. So you get a very MOIST environment. Like water is condensing on the unit and making little puddles.3. The compressor is noisy--and now it's inside your room rather than hanging out the window.4. It takes up valuable floor space.I suppose this unit is fine for what it is. But a good window unit will beat it 10 days out of 10.",3
"This works well as a fan, but is actually quite loud even on the lowest setting.The cool setting uses the water in the basin, which is terribly difficult to fill, since no funnel is offered and the fill spot is way at the bottom, inside a panel, which is also a bit tough to remove. Try that with a gallon jug.It got so thick in the air, with moisture, but didn't especially cool the place off. The only saving grace was the direct fan. Honestly.",3
"At this price point it’s not worth it. I mean, the fan is not bad, the water makes the air coming out cooler, but it won’t cool down the room and lower the temperature. It even says on the box that it won’t make your room cooler. It’s just a strong winded, loud (!) fan that is nice as long as you’re right in front of it. On hot days when we put it in our bedroom and close the door it’s like walking into a humid hot pool house a couple hours later. Oh! And it makes screeching sounds when it reaches lower water levels so you don’t get the stated hours of use out of it. Buy a cheaper fan, this ain’t worth it.",3
"THE GOOD: The front grid is more solid than the previous model. If you fill it with Ice and Water, it does help to cool....but only if you add ice. If you just fill with water it is no better than a fan. It is a nice looking unit. THE BAD: The power cord is much shorter than the previous model, which is a problem. The remote is flimsy, cheap, doesn't work that well and is really difficult to open. Once you do open it, you will find it needs one of those round, Quarter size batteries (which, of course, is not included). This model doesn't beep when the water level is getting low. There is no warning system. You have to unscrew the back of the unit in order to clean the filter. With the previous model you could just slide the filter out to clean it.",3
"It cools, but noisy when compressor running, no noise insulation at all, vibration cause plastic housing more noise. window seal kit has uneven height, need extra thick rubber tapes to help sealing air gaps.",3
"large, loud, more like a big expensive fan, only cools if standing in front of it, my apartment is 700 sq feet and it does not cool to the level I would hope for, also it increases humidity which leads to mugginess and further sweating in heat, returning",3
Be aware this unit ships only with a US plug and you will require a converter if you want to use it in the UK. This information is not supplied by the seller.,3
Not sure why the funnel keeps disconnecting from the unit. Highly annoying. It's loud but cools the area well.,3

HDD Enclosures are always confusing as there are so many available in the market with so different ways of connecting peripheral/auxiliary devices. I went through a large list of HDD Enclosures and after couple of days purchased this item - waited for couple of days only to find out that this enclosure does not fit my internal hard disk. The board had some soldering blemishes but never had a chance to test the connectivity. The build looks pretty ok and it was a great ide to include the screw driver as part of the package - It was really helpful. Be sure of what Hard disks you are using - SATA is common these days. I ended up buying a SATA to USB cable that served the purpose of transferring data from my old hard disk to a newer one. This product may be good for the price advertised but ensure that this one serves the purpose. This would fit only HDD of laptops cos its 2.5inch and would not work with the bigger solid state drives - the ones which are normally used for desktop,3
"The device works, but you have to be careful with it. The IDE connection is not very deep and doesn't seem to be reliable. On the top of that, IDE connection is the only thing that hold the drive inside the case. While I am moving around with enclosure, I can hear the hard drive rattling inside.The Enclosure is OK for the stationary setup, but would not work for any mobile tasks.",3
This product is not for you if your going to use this as you primary portable hard dive. The only use for this enclosure is to retrieve data from another HDD.The solder joints are weak and look like their about to break.This product is not going to last very long so get a this is not for you if your going use it long term.,3
"Apparently, not all 2.5"" laptop drives are the same, or perhaps what i have isn't exactly a 2.5"" drive (IBM Travelstar, DCXA-210000, out of an old Dell laptop(?)). It didn't fit in the aluminum case... real close, but no cigar. Maybe if this drive had ever so slightly rounded edges along it's length it would fit.Fortunately, this is acceptable for my needs. It electronically edge-connected to my drive & provides the USB2.0 interface, but i do have to leave the drive out of the case, naked / exposed. O-well. 'Works.Karl*----->",3
"First things first, this enclosure is not blue, as listed. It is silver, and looks very similar to my other enclosure, which causes me some confusion, and is why I bought (or attempted to) a blue one.Otherwise, it works fairly well. Can get a little hot since it lacks fans, but keep it off of any insulating surface and it's fine.",3
"it took me a few extra minutes to plug in my drive and the usb cable came with the drive didn't work at first, but I figure out that problem and now it works great. Quiet, fast and slim.The vendor sent me a replacement usb cable no extra charge.Thx.",3
"As an enclosure, it seems to work fine. I knew it was cheap; we'll see how it fares over a period of time.My only quibble is the cable. I don't mind the Y-cable for use with computers that need the extra connection for power. It's the fact that the cable is a nonstandard USB A-A. Almost every other USB drive is A-B or A-mini B. Why does this matter? Because if you lose the cable, it'll be a hassle to replace it. As a consultant I have a lot of external drives, and don't want to worry about keeping specific cables with specific drives.",3
"Well, i have had it for a while and it was working. But then my computer suddenly stopped realizing it was even plugged in. So i tried another computer, and then my laptop, but nothing. I think it may be the driver, but I am just warning you people that you need to be careful.",3
"This drive works as advertised, my issue comes from the fact that the connector on the drive is a USB A connector. This makes things a little tough if you lose the cable - because it isn't easily replaced with either a mini or micro USB end, or the standard USB B connector. I doubt I'll get another one - though once connected it did work as expected.",3
"Like the title says, it does what it needs to and nothing more. I had to et one of these to do a data recovery from my brothers laptop.The case itself is well designed accept for the back plastic cover. It will take some jimmying to get it back on once the harddrive is installed in it. BUT YOU CAN DO IT.Also, don't loose the original usb cable.

"Works fine with Windows XP but unfortunately I bought this to access data on my old drive from a computer using Windows 7. Windows 7 says the drive is invalid and only give me an option to format it. Odd too since the data on the drive was all created in Windows 7. I have not yet tried that because I wanted to pull some data off of it first. I had to connect it to my work computer that uses Windows XP and share over the network to pull data.On a side note: this comes with a USB cord that has three plugs and no instructions at all on which one goes to enclosure, which one is supposed to plug in or if it even matters. One of the plugs is longer and thicker my guess is that one is for USB ports that are further away from where you want to put the drive but then I don't know since there are NO INSTRUCTIONS.",3
It has teenie-tiny phillips screws to hold in the top. Had to stuff some folded paper down inside because the case is longer than my HD and it kept sliding back and forth. The did supply a little phillips driver for those screws but the head of the supplied driver was way too big for the screws. What a joke. It worked once mounted and modified but it should have some foam or something to account for different length HDs and some click-in type of mounting instead of screws like those that are in your glasses. These screws are going to get lost and screw into plastic directly so eventually will strip out its socket. It does have a nice slip-in case and sleek color.,3
"This product was easy to set up and install. With a DVD it has pretty good surround sound and appears to be well balanced. The wireless rear speakers work well. One feature which was suprisingly missing, however, was the ability to connect the sound from your digital cable box by means of a fiberoptical connection so that you would get true dolby when the show is broadcast in dolby 5.1.",3
"This book provides examples of how to do certain special effects.It was definitely more of a ""tips and tricks"" book than it was a learning resource. Just follow the steps, and go ""WOW"" just like the title.It doesn't really explain in detail how the trick was done and why you're doing a certain step. Most photoshop gurus will just scoff at this book, and most newbies will walk away amazed, but no smarter about photoshop than before they read it.The latter portions of the book was nothing more than a summary of the different photoshop filters found in commercial filter packages. I question why thoese filters were even in the book; it seemed like advertising that does not benefit the readers.",3
"I absolutely loved the anime of Cowboy Bebop. This book is set in the same universe with the same characters. Their stories, however, have changed. The way we meet Ed, Faye, Ein, and the history of Spike and Jet are different based on the author's take on the characters. Some might not like this, but I like the new twist on their relationships. Plus the author has added a whole new badguy! Since the TV series is over, it is also like getting all new Bebop stories. I haven't read the rest in this manga series so I don't know how they continue, but if you are dying for more Spike and don't mind the alternate reality, I highly recommend the book!If you don't want the stories to change, consider picking up the Cowboy Bebop series by Hajime Yadate and Yutaka Nanten, ISBN#1931514917, simply called Cowboy Bebop Book 1 etc. These are more like continuing adventures that take place in between what would have been a TV episode.",3

"i like RBL and Black-C a lot. Taydatay is my favorite from 11/5. So this combo made me expect a lot. Production is not as great as I would have thought, but there are some cuts (at least a few from black c) that dont sound too rapmaster keyboard-drum machine style. I liked the title track w/ big mack. taydatay/big mac collabo album would be good. as i said, the lyrics overshadow the production- sean t (he did this title track), ric roc (its hard 2 b-legit) have the best in the bay right now..",3

"Offutt's strength is his prose and characterization, but his narrative is a little off here. A shame really, because his first memoir was solid all around. He himself admits to not knowing what the Holocaust story has to do with his own return to Kentucky and, quite frankly, neither do I. It seemed thrown in as maudlin filler and was blatantly incongruous.The ending seemed rushed too. ""I am saying good-bye"" and ""I want to stay. I am ready to leave."" I know he can do better and the rest of the book proves that he can do better.Still though, there are some stylistic gems here. Offutt uses words and characters wonderfully. You'll love them and understand them. He's a very solid writer and students learning to write creatively can learn a lot from his craft--overtly and subtly.Worth a read.",3

"Among Arnold's early movies, this one stands out for the eclectic supporting cast. His early movies were remarkedly free of any acting on his part; I suspect he was still learning English then. But one way to make him look better is to hire nonactors, or miscast semiactors. Enter Wilt and Grace. (Later, Richard Dawson). This is as much a collectible as Terminator 2.",3
"""Conan the Destroyer "", this disappointing sequel to the entertaining and well made ""Conan the Barbarian"" is an example of what happens when studios attempt to broaden the appeal of a movie for younger audiences. This movie tries to inject more slapstick humor and includes ""big name"" stars (Grace Jones and Wilt Chamberlain), while sacrificing much of the story line, effective characters, and raw action that made the first movie so watchable. The special effects were also weaker and often seemed out of place, making this a real step backwards.If it wasn't for ""Arni"", it wouldn't be worth the price of the DVD. Recommended only for die hard Conan and ""Arni"" fans.",3

"Had eagerly awaited this one. Great movie, but the image quality was in no way up to BluRay standards. Not having seen it in the theater, I don't know whether this was by design.That said... Oscar-worthy.",3
"Everybody knows the movie is fantastic, and I'm sure the transfer to blu-ray is equally as impressive, but I received this product with a giant puncture mark through the case. There was no damage to the box, so I assume it had to be due to how the movie was handled in the warehouse. It literally looks like somebody attacked it with a screwdriver. Luckily it didn't damage the disks, but regardless it's still annoying.",3
I absolutely love this movie. I hate paying $25 for blu ray discs though as even with my top notch equipment it's just not that much better. I already have two versions of the dvd.. yeah i like it that much and wanted the blu ray basically cause the price was right. However i was disappointed as when i got it there was a golf ball type divet in the blu ray which wouldn't allow it to play. I unfortunately had to return it. I am giving this item a 3 star for midway though because i received fast service and it was extremely easy to return at no cost to me.So yes quality control sucked that this got out as it clearly couldn't play for anyone but Amazon customer service support was top notch for returns.,3
"I wasnt planning on watching this movie but decided to last minute. I saw it on the huge screen at IMAX.. special effects and action was great.. heath ledger was fantastic in the role as the Joker.. i had only seen him in romance and drama roles before this, but he really suprised me with this one. He really went out leaving his mark.If you're not a fan of his, or of the Batman series, you might not become a fan from watching this movie, but i do recommend giving it a chance at least. Its a pretty good storyline and even a bit scary towards the end.. i only bought the dvd for a friend, but i wouldnt mind watching it again.Definately watch it if you're a Heath Ledger fan though.. he was awesome in his role and you will love him in this one.",3
"This was a solid movie, but way too long. It was as if they kept putting in another scheme for the Joker to pull off...then another...then another. Why? They could have cut 30 minutes from the movie easily.I have to say that I was expecting much more from Heath. While his performance was certainly solid, it was by no means the oscar winning portrayal I was hoping to see. And for him to have said that the role was so disturbing that it was causing insomnia and a lot of his problems--he clearly had some emotional issues then, because the Joker was actually a lot more tame that I thought he was going to be. All in all a solid movie, but it was too long and over-hyped.",3
When i hit the play button i watched so horrible video quality for a release that this one..i felt ripped off.The Sound- The sound is very clear and crispy. No hiss sound or cracking sound.Extras- well another let down here.,3
"My star rating is for the BluRay, not the film itself.As much as I love this movie (and I do love this movie), I had to settle for the standard DVD version because of the sudden aspect ratio changes for the IMAX footage. I found this amazingly distracting and it constantly kept throwing me out of the movie. Hopefully someday they'll release another BluRay version that has the option to disable the IMAX ratio switch and I'll be able to upgrade, but until then I must make do with 480p when I watch this wonderful film. It's a shame, too, because other than the annoying ratio swapping the film looks amazing on BD.",3
that must have been the studios motto when they made the standard dvd. This has to be the worst transfer I have seen in modern film making. I am absolutely perplexed why this film was not made in DTS except as others have pointed out that perhaps they are trying to push Blu Ray.Its a great film ( I saw it three times in IMAX) but this dvd is a disappointment. We deserved better.,3
"Everyone knows about the movies that are very well written, casted, and directed. They are awarded and phrased films we've placed on our movie shelves for good looks and not show (There Will Be Blood, No Country For Old Men, Atonement, Titanic, Broke back Mountain, Batman Returns, may i continue...) . I have added The Dark Knight to the movie I must own, because it was great (and Heath Ledger died before it's release and has made it history), but i will never suffer through the three hours of talk talk talk and batman's boring humiliation AGAIN!!! EVER!",3
"Batman tries to destroy organized crime in Gotham. The Joker is the adversary here in this sequel to Batman Begins. It was one of the top two highest grossing films ever along with Spider Man 3. Comic fan or not, Batman has his origins in the 1930s with Detective Comics, hence the DC company. Nightwing was the original Robin. The secind Robin was killed by The Joker in A Death in the Family. In the Knightfall, Knightquest and Knightsend series in the 90s, Batman is crippled by a new villain named Bane. His latest protege Azrael dones an upgraded costume in his sit in as Batman. In Zero Hour Nightwing regrets Batman didn't take him as the fill in. They brought in Batgirl in like 1989.",3
"I really enjoyed Batman Begins and looked forward to this movie, but I was disappointed. The story line is great, the acting superb, but it is extremely dark and violent. I think it could all have been done as effectively without all the gratuitous ugliness. The depiction of the prosecutor after his burns was not believable and better suited to a horror movie. A very good concept taken too far.",3
"The acting was great!!! The movie, though, was very dark. I like a little more light!! Heath Ledger will be missed!!!!!!",3
"Apart from the mask, there isn't that much special about this limited edition. No audio commentary is my big complaint. However, the Batman Unmasked featurette is an unexpected pleasure, as it psychoanalyzes Batman in all his incarnations. I suspect there's another limited edition coming with more bells and whistles. Me, I bought this because I loved the movie and this set cost as much as the regular two-DVD edition.",3
"I wil not get into a review of the film itself, other than to say its an outstanding movie...far transending the genre into a truly imaginative frightening film. The DVD on the other hand is insultingly bad. Poor resolution...artifacts...edge enhancement....lots of compression...poor black levels...etc. Its dvds like this that make some believe that studios, especially Warrner Brothers are intentionaly degrading the potental quality on standard DVD to help push Blu Ray. Until this dvd I thought that was some paranoid delusion on the part of some film fans, but this DVD is so shoddy ...especially for such a film, that I can almost believe that they may be on to something. Shame on Warner Brothers for this truly sub standard DVD. I am a television producer, so I know what a DVD can and should look like...and this is NOT it!!!",3
"Yes, Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is an excellent film without question. BUT, shame on Warner Bros. for releasing such a not-so-special 2disk special edition for it's initial release onto DVD. NO INTERVIEWS WITH HEATH LEDGER? Or most of the cast and crew for that matter. Instead you get a scant pathetic 2 ""making off"" tiny featurettes, 6 lame episodes of ""Gotham Tonight"" the seperated IMAX scenes, and some yawn trailers and photo galleries. They're obviously saving the real good stuff for next year's release after Ledger's won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his amazing portrayal of the Joker.So yes, the film rocks, this release sucks though, so Please...be Patient.",3
"This movie simply had too many holes in the plot and was far too drawn out to earn the title of best movie in the current Batman series. Batman Begins was a much more compelling, well written, and far better film in my opinion.",3
"The Bottom Line:The Dark Knight, despite being one of the best reviewed films of 2009, does not measure up to the accolades bestowed upon it or to its prequel Batman Begins; it's poorly-plotted (the ending *actually* hinges on a magical technology that allows Batman to see what everyone in the city is doing), severely overlong at 150 minutes, inconsistent with its characters (Harvey Dent is supposed to be enraged at the death of his fiancÃ©e, yet he teams up with her murderer) and just not the gem that it is made out to be.2.5/4",3
"I'm so disapointed in this movie.I'm glad I waited for ""The Dark Knight""to come on HBO instead of paying for the DVD.Heath Ledger is great,He really is the Joker,but TOO much Tongue.A couple of times is alright,but every scene !Christian Bale is horrible.He sounds like Puddy on Seinfield.I can't believe he was cast to play Batman.""The Dark Knight""is not a film I want to watch again.",3
"There's lots of action in ""The Dark Knight"". The Joker (Heath Ledger) stole the show. He played the character perfectly! Blu-ray quality is outstanding, and the audio is awesome. I didn't like the fact that the scenes switched from the Imax view to the widescreen with black bars. This took away from the movie in my opinion. Good special features. Buy the DVD for Heath Ledger's acting and the good blu-ray video and audio. The movie is over-rated.",3
"The Dark Knight starring Christian Bale is pretty exciting but the hype doesn't live up to my chargin. Heath Ledger is absolutely brilliant as The Joker, he is muchly missed but he's not the one who steals this movie, Aaron Eckhart is a pleasant surprise! I'm glad Katie Holmes didn't reprise her role as Rachel, Maggie Gyllenhaal is such a better actress by far. The opening scene is probably the best sequence, the ending is a bit of a letdown. Entertaining action flick but has its flaws.",3
"Don't get me wrong on the 3 star rating, I love this movie. The reason I knocked it down is because the special edition version is a total waste of money. I could never have imagined such a total lack of effort for such a major movie as this when it comes to special features. Hell, there isn't even a director's commentary on the single disk version, so what do you think you're getting on the second disk. Yes, the two little documentaries are interesting, but are not worth the extra money. I am extremely disappointed in whoever put this thing together, my copy of Dr. Strangelove from the 1960s has more special features than this, what were they thinking.",3
"At one point in the movie, nearing the end, I was saying to myself, ""My God! How much longer can this go on! What more can they do!""As a showcase for special effects and especially Heath Ledger's amazing performance, this movie is a success.More from Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman would have been nice, as would more of a story.It's almost like they took an hour of the Joker's life and bisected it into seconds. Senseless violence, on and on...",3
"I saw the Dark Knight without seeing Batman Begins simply because I was curious and I needed something. I was blown out of my movie-seeing brain! At the urge of the man (who wasn't present when Dark Knight came out) we saw Dark Knight Rises. It was NOT THAT GREAT. If I had to tell someone to only see one, I'd say see Dark Knight because it is non-stop suspense and intensity with so many twists and unpredictable spins you're still thinking about it. The Dark Knight Rises is predictable, looooooooong, and leaves so many open ends Christopher Nolan is lying through his 5 layers of fat that this ""trilogy"" is over. You cannot end this on a weak note. See Dark Knight. If you choose to be fulfilled, see Batman Begins, Dark Knight Rises (not cuz it's better, cuz you need the history), then Dark Knight. Don't save this til last, but save the 3 hrs if you plan on it. It's really not the best",3
I barely remember watching this. Weak story and weak performances. In the comics Batman and Bruce Wayne were big hulking guys. That helped with my suspension of disbelief. Making these guys heart throbby is obviously the idea of Hollywood suits. It sometimes works in favor of their bottom line but not this time.,3
Made poorly out of flexible plastic. overpriced. Wish it was of better quality.Movie rocks though!,3
"I saw this film on an airplane on my laptop because it had been sitting on the hard drive. The graphics were very good, the acting was decent, the action was unbelievable and the rubble used was of both high in quality and quantity. This is the ideal films for people who love blockbusters, super hero films and strong villains. I don't think there is anything different here in terms of the story line.Christian Bale acted well, the late Heath Ledger was good too but overall the film doesn't have enough grey to intrigue one beyond the 153 minutes it runs for. I'm not into superhero films and think this is about as good as they get. To me, Nolan's masterpiece was The Prestige.",3
I liked Batman begins much better then this movie. I thought Dark Night was way too dark of a movie. I wasn't expecting that from what we have seen with the past Batman movie and comic books. Also all the hype on this movie was way over done. I think Heath Ledger was a great actor but this wasn't his best by far.,3
"Well, as I turned it off after about 20 minutes or so, it would appear, definitely, that it was just not my kind of movie. A movie, must really grab me in the beginning or off it goes. This one did not.",3
"Little too dark for me, a 50 y/o female, but hubby loved it. Said it was the best so far.",3
i still haven't watched it completely yet cuz i keep falling asleep but this movie is awesomeee!..from last time that i watched it before this copy of my own.eh on blue-ray since i don't get what the big fuss is about but wooo cuz this movie is great and with mucho action.,3
"I seem to be in the minority, but this just wasn't as good as I expected. I much prefer ""Batman Begins"". Over analyzing, I find myself wondering how the Joker managed to set so many charges in the hospital...when did he or his ""little helpers"" find the time and opportunity? Stuff like that just bugged me. But, most of all (and I suppose one has to be from Minnesota to appreciate this), the Joker reminded me way too much of Al Franken. Al Franken with lipstick on. Looked like him. Sounded like him. Easy to dislike, sure, but still...disconcerting.",3
My son likes this movie. I ordered it for him. The quality seemed to be good. It was a good price for the product.,3
"The Dark Knight Blu-ray well-received. The contents were completely without moreConfiguration was good. But no matter, even private sellers on Amazon U.S.Does the product were sent to Canada to say thrilled? Will be too upset.Amazon Sellers ""It makes you regret salgeol. hey, intervideo is the best teacherHope you have had this happen. I've seen the movie. Awesome picture quality andHas left a sound impression. Thank you.",3
"I finally watched this video the other night. It starts out very slow but then takes off with a 'shot'. It is a very 'dark' movie as all have said before me, but not it's too awfully dark emotionally as I had anticipated. It is shot in a dark cinema mode for affect. I liked the movie, though, I could not help thinking about the demise of Heath Ledger and was overcome with thoughts of his daughter who will never know him.His perfomance was good! Christian Bale and Gary Oldman, who have been overlooked, also gave good perfomances for this genre,but due to the controversy surrounding Mr. Ledger's death they have been overlooked, but that's just my opinion.I pray for Mr. Ledger'sfamily. I also pray that in time his last performance as an actor will not be over shadowed by his death.This is a definate See It!",3
"Wasn't sure what to expect, there has been so much hype about the film along with Heath Ledger's demise soI wondered if it would be a big disappointment, it wasn't. It was very well acted by all concerned, excellent special effects, some really DARK moments, all that have been described to death in other reviews, such as the mobile phone in the stomach, blowing people up etc along with the Joker, the amazing Heath Ledger (I liked him better in a Knight's Tale but he is pretty good in Dark Knight) running around Gotham City like maddened clown on prozac, not to mention Michael Caine as Batman's butler, and Batman himself, a troubled soul who doesn't know if he himself is good or bad?Worth going to see if you really the big cinema experience but I would have been happy to wait for it to come out on DVD, it was good but it's not in my top ten of movies.",3
"I had watched this movie in the cinemas. But, i'm afraid i prefer the previous bat man movies!Christopher Nolan has the habit of hiding action choreography with dark scenes, and quick micro view of fighting sequences which makes me wonder what when by. Honestly, I cannot savour the action scenes half the time, 'cos they are either hidden by the dark lighting or a partial micro view of the action!Sorry such direction may fool the rather imaginative audience who rely totally on their subconcious imagination for action, but not me. I am not convinced of the shortchanging action sequence. My ultimate hero movie is still the Spiderman trilogy, where you can savour clearly the action sequence that is really a mastery of action hero movies at its finest.",3
"The bat pot is made of plastic, detailed and nice but for a blu ray collector the case could be inconvenient. I would rate it more if additional to the bat case the package includes the regular blue box.",3
"Did anyone's set come with the same exact two discs inside the mask? My brother and I both received this from our mom on Christmas. I know the discs looks the same outside, but I put both in the dvd player and they have the same exact content on them. Anyone else find this? Wtf?",3
"I got a blu-ray version ""The Dark Knight""sound is good , but picture quality is not badalmost even that standard DVD I thinkThat's disappointedand this Bluray's most of the problem is mixed IMAX filmBecause , there's aspect ratio will changing in sometimeI been annoying while I watchingThis is not really movieI don't like thisWhat does Christopher Nolan thinking ?If standard DVD is not including IMAXI have to buy it again",3
"stunning picture on the blu ray release of this DVD but the aspect ratio changing throughout the entire picture is distracting and annoying.also, the most of the spoken dialogue is very difficult to hear.love the film - hate the DVD.",3
"Christian Bale returns as Batman in the sequal the Dark Knight. Once again he does not fail in bring the goods. He was a talent actor. The same goes to the late Heath Ledger in his Joker. Before the Joker was always a silly villain in previous Batman movies but in this one he is an awsome, twisted villain you can't take your eyes off. The sequal packs a lot action and twists I didn't see coming. Like Batman deciding to save the District Attorney rather then Rachel whom I assume he would. The District Attorney becomes the second villain in the movie as that act and his disfigurement transforms him from the good hearted hero to villain. You can see and understand why he falls from grace which has always been one of my favorite things to watch. The only problem the Dark Knight has though is it drags on and on. When you think its over it contiunes on and on.",3
"This movie was a disappointment. It was so hyped up by the press that I thought for sure it was going to be absolutely amazing, but it's not as good as Batman Begins, overall. The plot is weak, the dialogue is boring, and it's hard to follow. Not because the plot is intricate, but because the story is just disconnected and vague in places. Heath Ledger delivers a great performance as Joker--that's the best thing about this movie. Most of the rest is hype. Cool special effects and a lot of action, as you would expect, though.Not as bad of as sequel as the latest Indiana Jones flop, but just not as good as I was expecting....",3
"I loved Batman Begins, so I was eagerly anticipating seeing The Dark Knight! Especially given all the hype it received.After watching it on DVD, I felt very mixed about it. Heath Ledger was great, he definitely deserves all the praise he got for this role. The main characters are fine as well.The problems I had with the movie is that it's way too long, for one thing. Dent's character wasn't needed in this series yet. The editing wasn't as good as the first movie in that there were parts that made no sense and should have been cut.For instance, Gordon fakes his own death to keep his family out of harms way. Nice idea by itself. But then once he's back ""alive"" again his family gets taken by Harvey Dent anyway! So much for that plan.I started to get bored in some places. Again, it was just too long and unfocused for me. It had some great spots, but not enough for me to recommend this as anything better than a so-so movie.",3
"I was pretty excited to get this dvd considering all the hype about how great the movie is, however, I was pretty disappointed after watching it! This movie is okay but it is not the ""oscar-worthy"" movie that people like to say it is. Like I said in the title...it's just okay. The three stars are for the quality of the blu-ray, not the movie itself.",3
"Heath Ledger is marvelous in his final role, and that should be enough to go see the film or rent it in some months time. But be warned that all the hype come from a crowd that consider ""comic-book-movies"" as the epitome of cinema. The movie is all metaphor, and some action sequences. And it is not exactly subtle when it tells you about good and evil. Maybe the readers of this lines will think that the film reflects the world's despair in bleak times, but in fact those Grey days are American ones. As with all the other ""comic-book-movies"" of this decade (I didn't see the latest Del Toro yet) this film will be lost in time as were the serials of yore. Entertaining?, yes. Depressing?, you bet. A classic?, is not, so better put your coins for that goal into ""Wall-E"", clear winner of the relevancy contest.",3
"I saw the movie in Imax when it was released. I thought the movie was very good, and well worth the money and time. Dark is right.I previously stated that I could only watch this on my Mac, but now I found that my old LG unit was failing. I just hooked up a newPanasonic DMP-BD60 Blu-ray Disc Player, Blackplayer, and it did just fine.",3
"The trend of film remakes in Hollywood concerns me. This movie is considerably darker and more gritty than the first Batman movie. Dark isn't always bad, but was this film really necessary? The Joker didn't really feel like the Joker. Mind you, Heath Ledger did a good job in his role, but the role itself did not really fit. If you like Batman, stick with the original movies - Jack Nicholson did an awesome job as the Joker in the first. Definitely rent this movie before you actually decide to buy, this movie will only appeal to certain tastes. I especially did not like the Joker's backstory in this one.However, the first film in this series was much better and more coherent.",3
This is a very nice movie and Bluray disc quality is excellent.But Packing not good.Amazon didnt ship me the bluray with Hard Paper Cover.That not good.It suppose to come with that perticular cover.So dont go with the pictures shown for the disc discription.,3
"I heard so much about this series, so maybe my expectations were too high. The batman character seems so flat and, yes, I know he is a comic book character. Also, I felt the actor's choice for Batman's voice was too distracting. The visual effects and design were quite well done and enjoyable to watch, however.",3
the itunes version did not worked so I guess you are better off getting it somewhere else and get the cheaper dvdthe movie is by far the best batman ever!!!,3
"This movie is not as good as the first installment of this series. My first problem is the length of this thing- it seems to just go on and on. The second is that there really isn't any suspense, and you actually just don't care about how things come out. Most of the plot twists may be seen about an hour before they occur- they've been done so much better in other movies. And, you tire of watching what seems to be an endless series of psuedo intellectual dialoge punctuated by scenes of predictable and overdone violence. The special effects are good, but the action scenes eventually get to be ludicrous and even silly.I have to agree that Heath Ledger did an excellent job- much more than I expected, but the rest of the cast lets him down.",3
"This movie is a hit in our house. The acting is just superb. Rarely do I watch a movie and forget I'm watching a movie, but that happens here. Gary Oldman is fantastic as Commissioner Gordon, Christian Bale is the best Batman ever, and Maggie Gyllenhall is such an improvement over Katie Holmes there are no words.My only beef with this movie is the sound editing. If you have the volume at a normal level to hear the conversations between the characters, when the action starts you're pretty much blasted by the explosions; I find myself constantly having to adjust the sound while I watch, and keep the subtitles on so that if the sound is okay for the action, we can still understand what people are saying. Hopefully when the next one comes to DVD, the sound editing will be better.",3
"I don't understand what is so great about this movie. It's a good action flick, but not the best or most exciting.The opening scene was really good, but after that the movie got dull. If it weren't for Heath Ledger's performance, I would have not bothered watching at all. Everyone else, except for Eric Roberts who was pretty cool in his small part, was boring as heck.""Iron Man"" is a much better super hero movie.",3
I would have liked to view less violence in the film. Scariest Joker I've seen !Worth watching but not a family movie,3
"Not going to say that the movie wasn't any good, it was very entertaining( a little too long though ). Seriously come on people this movie is only breaking records at the box office do to the death and performance of Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger did an amazing job. He completely stole the show. Christian Bale was good when he was Bruce Wayne but when he put on the silly costume and became the Batman things got a little retarded. Like his voice for example. Another complaint that I have is everyone out there comparing this movie to Iron Man. Iron Man was also a very entertaining movie with flaws. Comparing the two is like comparing apples to oranges they are both two totally different types of films. So jump off of the high horse and realize that Heath Ledger is the main reason that The Dark Knight will smash box office records.",3
"The movie is great! but the features sucks! If you wanna buy cause of the movie go for it, but if you are a feature fun, then don't waste your $$$, we should wait till they come out with a better version and show more on how the made the movie etc.",3
this product is not what I am looking for. It did not improve my skin. I will not buy it again.,3
I bought this sleep mask 4 years ago for a school trip to South America. Was able to wear the sleep mask comfortably while traveling. I like the raised eyes and nose. As long as I wear it low it keeps all the light out. I have worn it occasionally throughout the years and it is now starting to fall apart a little bit.,3
"While I found Just Do It an interesting, well-written book, the book was obviously partial to Nike and Phil Knight. After reading this book, I was unsure if I could take the Nike Company at face value. Katz glosses over the issue of Nike's sweatshops, a topic which I was very interested in, and hoped to learn more about through this book. Nike is known for its powerful advertising, and Just Do It gave me many insights to the great extent that Nike goes to in making the perfect commercial.",3
"I have been a Susan Johnson fan for several years. Her stories of the Lakota Indian family (I forgot the name, but Blaze is the mother) were wonderful. Her stories are always hot and sexy with real relationships between passionate people who are not afraid to express their love for each other. While this book had her trademarks, it seemed very contrived with her trying too hard to put the hero and heroine into situations that you knew were made up just to be made up.I love her still, however, and hope she recaptures the spirit of Blaze's family in her future books.I hate to critique, however, because if I could write I'd be doing it.",3
"These women know their swing. From rocking originals like ""Salvatore"" to reinterpreted traditionals like ""Frailoch,"" this album satisfies the need within all of us for reedy rhythms. Amy Denio is an extremely talented musician AND an exceptional bandleader, and it shows. The players have obviously spent many hours practicing together, and each song is richer for the effort. Music like this, played only for the sheer love of playing, is as good as it gets.",3
"Four saxophones and occasional drums yield a good mix of soundplay. Traditional songs like ""Frailoch,"" innovative compositions like ""I Will Be Sad,"" and thoughtful pieces like ""Bus Horn Concerto"" are rich and stand up well to repeat listenings. Unfortunately, the recording is just muddy enough to keep this from getting a fourth star.Fans of Amy Denio shouldn't pass this up - even if her tremendous vocal talents aren't showcased, her compostion and instrumental accomplishment shine.",3
"I have one of these jacks supporting the rear of my trailer in the driveway, it is rock steady even with four people in the trailer. I like it that these are light weight (steel jack stands can be quite heavy) and I like that these come apart easily and stack up into a compact set for storage.As far as using these for camping: hmmm. They are really too short for my camper, so I'll need to haul 2x6 pieces around to raise them up. Also, the head (the piece that touches the frame of the trailer) doesn't swivel well under load and can pop off of the frame while you are raising the stand. And the steel parts (the nut and the screw) aren't galvanized so they rust.",3
"The movie could have been better if they left out Nicolette's horrific so called acting. all the other actors did their characters justice! The make-up in first 12yrs for the female actress for the story line was gruesom, but it did get better!! All in all the movie was fine I would recommend buying this movie @ a discount only!!",3
"This is a good book for younger female audiences (10-17). The characters appeal to the reader and the descriptions are superb. The reader gets a real sense of who these people are and what summer in Silverton, Colorado, is like. I empathized with Lissa and her desire to make a life away from her aunt, who has managed her life since she was orphaned.. John is the typical ""rescuer"" but we cheer him on in his escape from his devious ex-wife, who plots to remove Lissa from his life forever.",3
"Normally I'm pretty satisfied with my OtterBox purchases, but this one was a bit disappointing. Because the glitter case is clear, it's not made of a hard plastic like the others. For some reason I thought it would be a little harder but it's a flexible plastic. Also, as a side note, don't be dumb like me and use acetone or nail polish remover around this. I melted the side of it within the first couple of days of having it.",4
Love this kit as it is cheap but feels solid. It is easy to use and is nice and sharp out the box.,4
"So far so good. Very easy to install, easy cleaning, super smooth operation and great water flow.",4
"This is a pretty sturdy, safe alternative to the traditional mandolin (though still use caution). Has several functions that all work decently for the cost. Good for a college student like I was - just starting out and wanting food simply chopped (not pretty). Bought it a while ago and kept it for about two years.It can have trouble cutting through tough veggies like potatoes and onions, so I needed to cut them in halves or quarters to cut them. Food gets very easily stuck, and is very difficult to clean out in the sink. Not sure if it’s dishwasher friendly, as I don’t have one.",4
"I love the nesting feature, but I am constantly worried about using a very high temperature while cooking. According to the instructions it strongly suggests to use a medium flame. Also, there is a weird grayish residue between washes on the bottom exterior of the pans. I think other than scratching each other that’s the reason for the felt dividers that came with the set. I feel like it should have one more large pot lid added so you can use multiple pots simultaneously. The cold storage lids don’t snap on, so they don’t feel secure when storing food in the fridge. Easy to clean both by hand and in a dishwasher.",4
"These have heavy enough bottom to not warp when cooking at medium-high heat. Come out clean from the dishwasher. As long as you don't dunk them in cold water when they are hot, these will stay good for a while.They are good for making omelets and sunny side up eggs; or even fried potatoes for a small family. Big enough well for deglazing and reduction of sauces, but obviously you don't want to make a bechamel sauce in these pans.",4
"I have a go-to set of mixing bowls that I love. But sometimes, especially during holidays and large cooking get togethers, I want to use a different set so I am not forced to wash and dry my set of 4 so often. So, in preparation for a large gathering weekend, I bought this set. I used many of the bowls and lids for the mass cooking adventure. I was pleased with the sizes and appearance of the bowls. I was able to use them for serving some dishes too. The lids worked well. I did not use the shredding feature so I cannot comment on that.I will note that the bowls are not thick or very sturdy. I hand washed all pieces so that they would not be warped. I saw in other comments that the kids warped over time. By hand washing, I suspect that won’t happen to mine. They are not thick, I emphasize. I do not plan to use these as my sturdy, everyday pieces but they will serve well as my secondary set. The metal is shiny but I suspect it will dull and scratch over time but that is just aesthetics. I love the bottoms as they do not move when mixing. For the money, this is a great set of bowls. I would not use them daily but I recommend them for back up prep and storing.",4
Nice sharp sturdy knife! Damascus pattern is not as visible in person,4
"Talk about being duped, read everything about this knife and was convinced it was made in Japan & sold in America, but alas, yes, sold in America but ""MADE IN CHINA"". I'm really getting sick & tired of this crap, AMAZON you need to lift your game & demand that these sellers display where the item is made!!!!!!! When I find an item that I'm tempted to buy it is the first thing I look for ""where it's made"" & if it's made in China then that's a NO GO for me because I've had to much CRAP from them & the quality is disgraceful, so if an item cannot display where it's made then I'll just move along or go without.",4

"Scissors are nice quality and do well cutting but have limited use due to difficulty of cleaning. These have limited applications because they don’t come apart for thorough cleaning. Any raw meat packaging or uncooked items that can easily transmit bacteria should be avoided as the bacteria can get trapped where shears are joined. Soaking or dishwasher cleaning ultimately results in rust as water cannot be totally dried. Because of this , they’re not truly all purpose and I will need to invest in another pair that can come apart.",4
they work great and are solid! sometimes they come defective where the red string is glued and it ripps the bags.,4
I wanted one with a stand to set up when entertaining a large group for a grab and go beverage option. The height is below waist level. It is folding table height. It did the job.,4
"Easy to clean. Does a nice job air frying and baking. I haven’t used all the features yet but so far it’s worked great. The only issue is the toast feature, which really doesn’t do a good job but no toaster oven does anyway. I use a toaster instead. Nice product.",4
"This quilt is not very thick nor is the nap very thick. It definitely has a nap, but it is very low and doesn’t dramatically change color when you smooth it against the grain. The loden color I picked is dark enough to pair with my purple throw pillows as my other comforters are dark purple. Because it is not very thick, it lays flat and offers a clean look on the bed. The shams are simple without frilly edges, but I like the look. The quilt is very thin; it does not really feel as if it is filled with anything, but it has a lot of weight to it so that it is sufficient for winter use. The California King size has plenty of length and width to cover my bed and even the top of my bed skirt - please note this quilt does not come with a matching bed skirt - so it looks smooth and finished when the bed is made. I do wish this set came in a dark purple and not the lavender they offer as I’d get that color in a heartbeat as I prefer this thinner but still heavy style of bed covering. I also like that it is basically the same on both sides so that you can reverse it and it won’t look “wrong”. And the fact that it can be machine washed and dried makes it a good option for someone looking for a flatter, less puffy look for their bed. My only gripe is that it wrinkles a bit.",4
This velvet quilt is nice. It is a but thinner than I hoped but it is nice and soft. My husband likes that it is thin but I get much colder than him. It washed and dried well when I got it. I didn’t notice any issue with stitching on my set. I think it is a nice snuggly quilt especially for those with texture sensitivities.,4
"Smells good, lasts a long time, calming.",4
Didn’t think I would like these as much as I do but they’re really nice and bright. Bright enough where I can sit in the office comfortably at night without the need of turning on the room lights. These also help with out with eye strain too that I’ve noticed when using the computer for long periods of time.Getting them up and running was a breeze and it also works just as well with Alexa assistant. Plenty of preset color options to choose from or you can make your own through the Govee App.Only reason I docked a point is because the double sided adhesive strips provided with the panels are abysmal. They lasted for a day before they started falling off the wall one by one. Had to order some 3M mounting tape to get these to stick so fair warning there.Overall I’m pleased with these and many other Govee products. Way more affordable solution compared to the other alternatives. I’d definitely recommend these.,4
"The lights are really easy to install with the app guiding you, it get nice and bright and works well with google home. I just Wish the app interface was a bit more user friendly and accessible.",4
This Reed diffuser has pleasant scent. I like how it has a decorative flower pattern not just sticks. It can be put in any room and the entire room smells nice. It comes in a nice box so it’s even perfect to gift to friends or family.,4
"I recently purchased the Reed Diffuser Set (Starshine1), and I’m really enjoying the fresh, pleasant scent it adds to my home. The fragrance is light and uplifting, with a nice balance that isn’t overpowering — it creates a calming atmosphere whether in the living room, bedroom, or even the bathroom. It’s the perfect scent for daily use and definitely enhances the ambiance in any room.The design of the diffuser itself is lovely and fits well with my home decor. I also appreciate the rattan reeds, which are stylish and functional. The aromatherapy effect is subtle yet effective, making it perfect for spaces where you want a gentle, consistent fragrance without it being too strong.My only minor critique is that I wish the scent-drawing straws (the reeds) were a bit larger. I’ve noticed that the scent doesn’t seem to diffuse as strongly as I expected, and I think larger reeds would help draw the fragrance out more effectively and fill the room with a more noticeable aroma. That said, it still works well for a more subtle scent and is a great option if you prefer a lighter fragrance.Overall, this is a lovely diffuser set with a great fragrance, and it’s a perfect decorative gift as well. I just wish the reeds were slightly thicker for better scent diffusion. Still, I’m very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others looking for a nice, relaxing room scent.",4
"First off, they are much smaller than I thought they’d be. I’ve only used one, as I needed something to store my towels on in my bathroom. It’s easy enough to install but even following the instructions, it ended up lopsided. No one notices but me..but it bugs me. I don’t like how flimsy it feels. I wouldn’t trust it for anything heavy.",4
"Instructions were clear, and it was nice that it specified the size of drill bits needed. But with the included hardware there is quite a bit of vertical flex to the bracket once mounted as it comes with countersunk screws which the bracket wasn't made for. After finding one of my shelves in particular was too saggy, I bought new screws with wide flat heads (see picture) and they are much more secure.It would also be nice if there was an included way to secure the shelf on the bracket - it just slides on and off. I'm considering whether I want to glue it, or perhaps inset a neodymium magnet on the shelf back so it would hold to the bracket.",4
Love the design and the fact that it melts the candle without getting smokey or sutty. Much safer than an actual lit candle. Just be careful when handling once it's turned on. Keep out of reach of children and pets.,4
My only complaint is that the little basket for the toothbrushes is skinnier metal than the rest and it doesn't stay on the hooks as well. The rest of them are perfect and look really nice. They hold a lot more than what we have to put in them.,4
"These wooden art signs are each a different size. When you store them, they nest inside each other. They are meant to be displayed on a table-top. They do not have hooks on the back to hang, but there is room to add a narrow one if you wanted to. The graphics are simple, in red and blue on a white background, but perfect for baseball (especially if you have an All-Stars display!). The slogans are those that baseball fans all know and love and are pretty timeless. My son is on two baseball teams, so I display these on the sideboard in our foyer with his team photos during the season.",4
I have this wreath on the front door and it will work for the summer. I have other wreaths for the other seasons. I like the way it looks and am pleased with it. I have to agree with other reviewers that the bow is very flimsy. I haven’t changed it yet but will do so in the future. Other than that it’s a nice looking wreath at a good price.,4
I have placed this near a window and the light shines through beautifully.,4
Very cute but smaller than expected.,4
Awesome pc for gaming gets around 240-300 fps in fortnite and never freezes all of a sudden. I recommend as for a first pc-,4
Wireless charger and headset plug dosent work other than that great pc,4
I like the support team response to a small issue. The repair was swift and great workmanship. My son loves his gaming computer and the lights around the computer match his room decor.,4
"Bought this for my 10 year old son. It is fairly fast out of the box. Runs his current games (Minecraft, Roblox, etc..) with zero issues. Looking forward to him getting into more robust games in the future so I can teach him how to upgrade his computer. This gives us a solid base that fits all his current needs and also allows us to build as we go. Big bonus is the looks. He absolutely loves the looks of this machine (little too flashy for my taste).",4
"it’s definitely worth the buy for the money. I’ve been playing on it for about an hour and have had no lag when it comes to opening things downloading things or even watching videos. The only thing that it can’t do (which is why i gave it 4 stars) and if you’re looking for this don’t buy, but it does not record gaming videos very well, which is what I wanted when I originally purchased, but I’m still happy with the product because it runs most of my games very well.",4
"The pc is good, third gen I5 performs better than expected even tho ddr3 ram starts to show its age, its still reliable. I only added a low profile card, The GTX 1050Ti from Zotac. It can run GTA Online between 50 to 75 fps (I cant see more beacause of the 75hz monitor), Fortnite runs perfectly on Performance mode, high settings, expect a few stutters for the few first games. For the E-sports titles such as Valorant and CSGO you'll have no problem running them. Its a pretty good computer for the price to performance ratio. I bought my gtx1050ti from Facebook Marketplace for 65 CAD$. BTW, I bought a different mouse with side buttons from Walmart for $6",4
"My previous desk only accommodated laptop. I was gifted a PC and needed to find something bigger but simple, as I had limited space. This fit that description perfectly. It's sturdy, sleek and affordable. My favorite perk is the built in power connections that allow USB and prongs. The lights are great and I like to match then with my keyboard. Very happy with this buy.",4
"Easy to build, took me about an hour total, instructions are very easy to follow. The desk itself is pretty sturdy, and holds all of my gaming setup no problem, with a good amount of arm room.I would’ve liked the desk to to be one single board instead of 3 smaller ones you combine to make the desk. Also the shelf to hold my computer is a tad bit small, with about an inch of my computer not being supported by the shelf it’s supposed to sit on, but I don’t think it will fall off unless it is kicked or bumped hard.The LED lights do not come with a sticky back, and the ones provided aren’t very good. So I’d recommend going and buying some double sided tape beforehand!Otherwise I am very happy with the product and the outcome! Great value for its price point.",4
"Bought this mic strictly because I was in need of a mic, mic arm stand etc. But what's even better is that some of my friends have the more expensive microphones like blue yeti and the 100-200 dollar mics for podcasts/recording music etc. and this one is right there with them I feel like. Maybe i'll notice more fractional differences down the road but as a overall mic, its great.The voice quality is very clear, it sounds crisp, no cutting out, no distortion, just a smooth voice with very little background noise. I use it for gaming, talking with friends on discord, even recording some vocals to see what my voice can really do lol. I guess I'm a singer now! It actually sounds better than I thought.It has soft touch buttons to turn volume of the mic up and down, holding it mutes. It just feels like such a satisfying touch.The design is clean, its the same size all around basically, doesn't feel outdated, too big and cheap, it feels like $100+ mic made with good durable parts and nice edges. Love the basically all black design.Overall, like I was saying, now that I have the mic, I would have just paid that much for the mic itself but since I was in need of the mic arm stand mostly, I went with this. Also though, I got a shock mount which actually is nice for not hearing any noise from things touching my desk, etc. I didn't know the value of this until I tried with and without it. The mic arm stand is nice, does exactly what it needs to do, use to have a super cheap 10 dollar one and it just wouldn't move smooth and this one just feels like a crane and its nice.Definitly will buy again, going to pick another one up soon for my girlfriend, built her a computer recently as well and it will be a good combo to have.",4
It's a Christmas gift for my daughter so it hasn't been opened but the pricing and shipping were great,4
"Shipment was delayed supposed to come in on sunday came on Thursday. Did come in thought UPS not amazon. At first of putting in power cord and HDMI cord ( HDMI cord did work) it would not turn on, but after inserting and plugging the power cord of the xbox off and on several times it did eventually work and then turned on. When it turned on it did restart itself twice but after worked completely normal. After all that no issues came from the xbox. Games like college football and Jedi Survivor has worked smoothly and download speed runs fast. Actually would recommend especially during prime day. A Xbox S 1TB was 350 no shipping while this on prime day in 2024 was 400 with shipping so definitely worth but can be risky with all the other reviews in place. Risk it though because this is way more worth it.",4
"If you want the new gen Xbox’s but can’t get the X, this is for you.",4
"The media could not be loaded. I bought this as a surprise for my son, as I was redoing his media room. Not only is it aesthetically pleasing, but super multifunctional. He can charge many things on this device. We love the lights on it. You can keep it one solid color. You can change it to a rotation of the colors too if you like. This has been great for minimizing cords and chargers and cables. Also, it keeps my son from just tossing his headphones down in a chair. This actually helps them last longer.",4
"Well, I wasn't planning on getting an 8th gen console. I was really in the state of thought, that it wouldn't be much of an upgrade from 7th gen to 8th, like it was jumping from 6th gen to 7th, or 5th gen to 6th. But. I had to reconsider since there where games coming out for the 8th gen consoles I really wanted, so I went on ahead and pulled the trigger. You only live once, amiright? My opinion about the leap from 7th gen to 8th is not that huge, is still the same. It really isn't that much of an upgrade. Just the likes of Xbox One and PS4 has smoother textures and graphics, and can handle more AI and activity than their predecessors. But hey, we're reaching the climax of how much we can do with this technology so it's a given.Now, that I have my views of 8th generation out the way, lemme get to the main course. The Xbox One.I enjoy it. I'm still trying to work around it and get to know it. Know the little new features that is. It's kind of like a 360, but with more. More downloading than the 360 as well. Just to play a DVD, I had to download an app just to make it work. I know. It isn't about watching movies, it's about the gaming. But still. Since previous systems just let you pop in the disk and play your movies, without having to worry installing features is kind of the point. Pop movie in Xbox. Movie plays. Pop movie into 360, movie play. Pop movie into Xbox One. Opps! You've gotta download an app for that! I know it's free. I know it's quick. But it's still stupid. Apps also have a knack for freezing sometimes. Like the youtube app. I'll be in the middle of watching a video, and it freezes. And I can't shut the tab down. The only thing left to do is to shut down the console and turn it back on. Scrolling threw the dashboard has a bit of a lag to it vs the 360. Maybe do to more plastered content? I don't know. I know. Stupid thing to nitpick about. Grain of salt people. But I'm sure these things won't matter with a few more patches and updates.Now that I've got the kinks out the way. Lemme get to the meaty part. The gaming experience. I haven't put too much playtime into it. But so fair, I say it's fun factor is very good. I had a good time playing Forza 6. More games are on the way so I can give this system some more playtime and open it up. This is going to be short since I just the console a few days ago and I need to get more in depth. But so far. No problems with the gaming aspect. Kind of funny thinking back in 2013, people where saying the Xbox One wasn't ""for the gamers"". It most certainly is.physical durability.Unlike last generation, within I year I would start hearing horror stories of reliability issues with the consoles of old. 2 years has already passed since these consoles had been out, I haven't heard any REALLY bad problems with these consoles yet. A few PS4's and Xbox One's bricked at launch, but only a slim few. The rest of time was smooth sailing for these consoles. Sure. The Xbox One isn't the prettiest looking thing in the world, but certainly isn't the ugliest. Like the original Xbox, this thing was built to last. There are huge vents everywhere. From the top to the sides, so no worries about overheating from hours of gameplay. Plus, the thing is really quiet. It doesn't make a peep. Unlike the old Xbox's, the One is so quiet you could hear a fly fart. The 360's fan roars more than Mufasa from The Lion King. I love how I can finally have some peace and quiet, when I have a console on. That's a welcomed change. Controller is not that shabby either. Although the 360 controller will always be my personal favorite. The 360 controller feels better than the One's by leaps and bounds. But when not compared to the 360 controller, the One's controller is really comfy and fitting. No huge complaints there.The verdict.I've only had the Xbox One for a few days, and I'm already loving it. It's not perfect. But it's not horrible like some people want you to believe either. (I'm looking at you PS4 fanboys.) The Xbox One is a fine investment that will give its owner hours of fun playtime for casual and hardcore gamers alike. Don't be expecting huge graphical leaps with these consoles. But don't think it's under powered either. The Xbox One certainly has redeemed itself, after it's horror show of a launch two years ago. So many people expected it to fail, but here we are. People are warming up to it and nodding in respect for Microsoft and the Xbox One turning around for the better.4/5",4
"I've been obsessed with it since it arrived. The seemless user interface and sleek design is absolutely captivating. From 10 percent, the phone will take 4 hours to charge if you have a regular adapter. It will hold a charge for a great amount of time. Pairs very well with Echo Buds, which I also highly recommend for audiophiles who look for balance between their music and their surroundings. The phone does come alone, without the promo for the $100 gift card, so double check your cart to make sure you chose the correct option.Update on having the phone for two months:This one of the best phones out there! The functionality is superb. However, it can heat up when fast charging and when using a couple of high functioning apps at a time. Fast charge take an hour and a half. The phone does not slow down, but the heat makes the phone a little uncomfortable to hold after, even with a case.",4
"I got this smartphone as an alternative to a.) Getting my iPhone 12 pro scrubbed.b.) buying another iPhone.To explain, I got hacked while using my iPhone and my bank wanted me to get it scrubbed in case there was some sort of malware on it. So rather than driving 40 minutes and paying $190 to get that done along with the paperwork certifying it was done, I just bought a brand new Samsung A-15 from Amazon. It performs well and satisfied my bank. Price is probably the .ain't factor in my purchasing this phone. I think I owned a Galaxy S-21 before, and I like this A-15 better. It has no water resistance, one speaker, but it has decent cameras and is fast enough loading internet sites. It's a tad big and heavy, but the + side is a larger screen. There is no inductive charging, but it uses a 25 watt charger that makes charging relatively fast. Also, the battery lasts a long time. I think it's 5000 miliamps. I've had it last over 3 days, so that's a plus. If you are an iOS user and have Apple Mail, that can be challenging, but once you set everything up, it's no big deal.",4
"I received this yesterday and have tried it out for nearly 24 hours now. I will be using this as a back up phone.The pluses.Nice big clear and bright screen.I like the case and the color. It looks and feel quite decent,Good, responsive touchscreen with good colors.Good wifi and bluetooth. On screen keyboard is also easy to use.Large battery, I charged it to 100 % last night and its still at 70%Good sound quality and fairly loud speakers.Negatives.There is some lag but that is in comparison to my “high end” main phone but I consider it to be more than acceptable.The cameras have great colors are appear to be over processed.If this was for use as my main shooter, it would not be acceptable but for the bargain price, and considering that this is budget phone, both front and rear cameras will suffice.Not too keen on the side finger print reader, it does work and actually responds quite fast, I don’t care for the location.So as a budget back up phone, there are some negatives but I can live with them all.Not; the first two photos were taken with the rear came at high resolution. The third was taken with the front facing camera. The last two were taken indoors in a restaurant setting on high resolution.I quite like this phone. I had been considering a 5 year old phone for a back up…. It still had really good specs but I was concerned about the battery and how much longer it would work. Also there would not be any security updates on an older phone but this is from 2024 and has already done several updates since I first powered it on, and it is due to be upgraded to Android 14 later this summer. ( I mention this because there are surely other folks looking for a budget back up phone.)Also, since I don’t play any games, I cant offer any opinions in that respect.For a back up phone, its ideal and I recommend it!",4
A budget phones serves all your needs for a second phone. Bit slow.,4
"Except the provided wireless controller. The left control stick was not functioning correctly and the controller would shut off on it's own.No problem as i had perfectly functioning controllers on hand.The important part was the console itself which happened to function perfectly. No issues or hiccups. I can now enjoy my 360 games again as my old console has been dead for several months,...though it provided over 11 years of service....i hope this renewed unit can provide the same.",4
A liked it but was a little on the small side and only red color.,4
"3D best in a dark room, less dark equals less crisp design. Best to have at eye level or looking at it straight on, when deciding where to place.",4
My grandson loved this.,4
Definetly works but you have to apply so much and one coffee and your back to stained teeth,4
Definetly works but you have to apply so much and one coffee and your back to stained teeth,4
It lightens my teeth a shade after several uses. However when I skip any days using it my teeth go back to their normal coloring.,4
As expected,4
"I have been using this for a few weeks now, and have not seen any significant results. I do realize that there are a lot of variables, and people have different diets, different brushing rituals, etc. So maybe others will see more significant results. The taste is not bad in my opinion (slight mint flavor). I would personally not buy this at the current price point due to the lack of results for me.",4
"I wanted to try this toothpaste as I do not want to spend a fortune on tooth whitening, and because I wanted to try a milder version of the dark charcoal toothpastes that have been around for a bit of time now but shouldn’t be used everyday because they have the potential to damage the enamel.The toothpaste comes in a simple tube with a screw cap and an initially sealed opening. The expiration date is on the box it comes in and is well into 2026, so no worries about taking a bit of time to use this paste.Expressing the toothpaste is almost too easy as the toothpaste seems thinner consistency-wise than other toothpastes. It seems to do a good job cleaning teeth, and although I wouldn’t say it has a pleasant taste, it is also not a bad taste.Rinsing it with just a bit of water by swishing it around gets rid of the paste quickly and I must say I am surprised that all the grittiness from the paste washes out just like that. I am not sure about the whitening effect yet, but my teeth feel clean and my mouth refreshed after each use.",4
"We loved this when we first got it. Our kid has a hard time opening toothpaste caps but this made toothbrushing easier and fun for our 6 yr old. But after some uses, it gets clogged since there’s no way to actually get all the toothpaste out unless you remove and rinse it every time.",4
Tastes great. It will get stuck in the tube. Not happy about that!,4
"way too expensive for absolutely no reason, but it is the only one our toddler wants to use so....",4
"No he doesn't want to use any of the more mundane and boring easily gotten mint toothpastes, so here we have a winner! Fantastic packaging, swift delivery and great taste. This could be the difference for my 10 yr old having teeth or not by the time his 15! very happy.",4
"Right after I use it, I notice a difference, but not sure it lasts. I’m not unhappy with it… I just can’t tell if I love it. It’s a cheaper alternative to other products.",4
Really works for a quick teeth brightening! I use before a night out and it does a good job for a quick touch up. Doesn’t really have a taste.,4
"This is my second jar. The taste is something to get use to. The essential oils do not cover the taste. You have to get use to baking soda. The perks, it’s great for sensitivity. Clove is wonderful. No foam, hard to brush that way but you adjust.",4
"I'm not a cheap person. And though this stuff works great, I'll be looking elsewhere for a cheaper, but comprable quality.",4
"Some of the tablets have partially disintegrated in the jar or broken into bits which is unfortunate, but the ones that are whole work well, very strong minty flavors. When you chew the toothpaste up only chew like 2-3 times the toothbrush will do the rest for you. It's definitely different to get used to but it works.",4
"I wanted to like these. I didn't mind them. They suds nice. I just felt like they fell short. I would consider buying them again, but at the moment I am shopping around. They do clean your teeth, are better for the environment that tubes, and they're great for traveling.",4
"This product is well-made and has excellent form, but the function was off for me. That being said, the product description is accurate; it's an ear irrigation flushing system, nothing more, nothing less. The tip disperses three streams of water that quickly empty the water cup into your ear canal. For me, at least, the process was not messy as the exiting water fell into the sink and not on my clothing. There are two buttons on the machine; get familiar with their function and positions if you're operating the machine by yourself. Otherwise, you might accidentally increase the pressure or prematurely start the machine, spraying water all over your bathroom.Now, back to the function: I was expecting something more, like pulsating or spiral streams of water. I believe I have clean ears, and I did not see any earwax removed after using the machine. After using the machine, I was able to extract earwax manually with an ear canal scraping wand. I don't think water alone would remove this ordinary earwax unless it came into direct contact with a pressurized water stream. Since there are only three fixed streams, only three spots on the outer ear canal are directly exposed to the full stream cleaning effect; the rest of the ear is exposed only to a water flush. If you are the in the market for ear flush irrigation machine this is the product for you.",4
"This ear irrigation system is compact and portable enough to take with you on vacation. The water chamber is emptied out the spout in 3 streams of water that do not rotate, pulse, or in any way agitate the earwax. The water gets warm, but not really hot enough or strong enough to dislodge stubborn wax. But this is probably a good thing because if it was too strong or directed into the ear drum it might cause damage and we wouldn't want that. It is good enough to help warm and loosen the wax so you can get it out with a scraper or to help assist the stubborn wax to come out of your ear when you can't get it with an ear scraper. My son had a heavy wax build up when he was small and the irrigation system the doctor used was huge in comparison to this item. If I would have had this back then the process would have been so much easier. But just remember to take it for what it is, an ear irrigation system. It just heats up and pushes water into your ear. It isn't a jet stream or a power washer.",4
"Doctors were flushing my ears once a year, because of a family bend in the ear canal. Still not perfect but helps and is easy to use.",4
"They work like advertised. Its bristles are about as stiff as a hard bristled toothbrush. The different sized heads are useful as well. The smallest head was especially useful for corners. The only reason I didn't give this a five star is because I really couldn't use it with the Pink Stuff. The bristles or motor just wasn't strong enough to cut through the pink paste. It works great with Ajax or Comet, just not the Pink Stuff. (I love the Pink Stuff btw.)",4
I love the ear wax removal micro camera for getting the places and seeing what's built up in the ear. I have had really itchy ears so this is great to get in and help clean out the itchy areas without causing harm or losing the tip of a cotton swab. I love the accessory tools that come with this for extra cleaning ability.,4
"This Ear Wax Removal Tool Camera is great to have as getting the inner ear visual is super cool and it includes different tools to remove the wax. However, this is an easy way for people wanting to dig deeper and deeper into the ear, which can cause a lot of harm to the eardrum -- leave that to a professional. It's neat to own and, for other purposes, great to have a micro camera.",4
"My opinion is that this steam cleaner is perfect for anyone who is looking for a method of cleaning their house that does not involve the use of chemicals, particularly for removing tough filth and grime. The fact that it comes with a variety of attachments is a significant advantage since it enables the cleaner to be adaptable enough to deal with a variety of surfaces and chores. The fact that this steam cleaner is both lightweight and small is one of the things that I particularly like about it. I believe that the mobility of this product is a significant benefit, particularly when it comes to cleaning areas such as restrooms or even the inside of your vehicle. It is simple to transport from one room to another. The deep gray color gives it a sleek appearance, and the ergonomic handle makes it easy to use for extended periods of time, which is ideal for cleaning applications. I am grateful that it warms up in a relatively short amount of time; it requires just a few minutes to get ready for use, and I did not get the impression that I was waiting around to get started. The set consists of twelve components, which include nozzles, a brush, and attachments that are designed for a variety of surfaces. The results of using the little brush to clean the grout in my bathroom were extremely impressive, and I am quite pleased with the outcomes. Because of the pressured steam, I was able to remove the filth that I had previously battled to remove with more conventional ways in a short amount of time. I believe that the steam is strong enough to remove debris that has been adhered to surfaces without the need for an excessive amount of physical effort, and I believe that it makes cleaning more effective in general.",4
"Works very good in getting down in the vent area. Was surprised at how much lint it cleaned out, which is comforting as I don't want a dryer fire.",4
These are long which works well. I use one for cleaning the dryer vent. I’ve cleaned it from inside the machine & from the outside vent. I use the other for cleaning out from under the fridge & the oven. The only negative for these is that they are difficult to clean all the lint & gunk off of the bristles.,4
"The Holikme 2 Pack Dryer Vent Cleaner Kit is a game-changer for anyone looking to improve the performance of their cloth dryer and safeguard their home against potential fire hazards.

But the benefits don't stop there. This versatile kit can also be used to clean dust and pet hair under furniture and appliances, making it a valuable tool for overall household cleanliness and maintenance.",4
"I love that this bends at different angles and that you can use it as a short handle or long one. The quality is great and it is very sturdy. It doesn’t bog down at all while you’re using it trying to get grime out of corners but I feel like the bristles could have been better. After one time of use, the bristles were pretty bent up and some were coming out of the brush. It is pretty powerful and lightweight. It’s a great value for what what you pay for it. There are multiple speeds but I feel like the highest speed works the best. It definitely gets grime off of things without having to hand scrub them but if you have a tough job, it won’t work well.",4
"This item gets a 4 because it is a great concept, long pole with a head that shifts so you can clean baseboards and a reusable head that you can remove and clean. Well, someone can remove and clean, not me. The cloth is really stuck on there. The plastic head is very flimsy and unscrews itself from the pole as you use it. I had to stop and screw the head back in three times while cleaning the baseboards.That said, the baseboard cleaner does a great job on a difficult task. The head could be more study and the cleaning cloth easier to remove, but the concept is a winner.",4
"It is handy to do baseboards with but flimsy pole, lean too much on it and would break.",4
"This gizmo does save one from bending to clean the baseboards. I do have a complaint though. The cleaning pad is really difficult to remove from the unit as the Velcro is incredibly strong which makes it difficult for arthritic hands. Secondly, even though I squeezed the water out of the pad before attaching it to the pole, I found that, when applying pressure to the baseboards to clean them, water dripped out of the pad necessitating having to get down to wipe up the wet. The cleaning pad is made out of some unusual fabric and it does not want to hold the water you put on it.",4
Seems to actually work. Not painful. Easy to use. Would buy again.,4
"Smells like chemicals sorta, not super intense and it’s gone once it dries but still, not what I would expect. It does peel really well and my skin does feel great.",4
"First of all, I want to say that these are EXTREMELY cool. I have never seen anything like this and for someone who will lay in bed to binge watch an entire series on Netflix, these are super nifty for avoiding any kinks in your neck. I actually thought it was a fluke because there is no way you could watch a show clearly with something like this, but IT IS LEGIT. The image is a bit smaller though.Cons:- Heavy -- considering these are to be worn like glasses, they are relatively heavy and can be super uncomfortable if worn for too long, so it's not ideal for long-term use.- Vision impairment? I am not sure how to explain it, but since you're technically staring at a reflection, it kind of messes with your eyes, in my opinion. I am not sure how it is when reading, but if you wear them while watching tv, then it almost feels like you're going cross eyed. Again, only happens if you wear them for too long. I've actually used them before bed if I couldn't fall asleep because it almost makes your eyes feel droopy and tired...Overall, it's super inventive and a really unique product, and despite the cons, I would still recommend it considering how inexpensive it is! But if you are prone to getting headaches, I wouldn't buy it.",4
Great buy for the price will buy again.,4
"These glasses are really pretty slick. De to the multi-focal lenses, I can wear them with or without my contacts, so I don't have to have different glasses (yes, my contacts do not completely fix my reading...)They don't sit quite right on the nose, so they do leave a mark when you wear them for any length of time. And they are NOT fashionable! They do, however, work great, and the price is very reasonable. Definitely recommend.",4
"For the price, these glasses are a steal. The materials feel high-quality and the craftsmanship is excellent!So far So good!",4
A good value but not very sturdy s little more fragile than expected. But great price so are more disposable,4
"The instructions specifically said not to walk around with them on, but the kids couldn't resist. They're a bit heavy on your nose but they did really help with neck fatigue while crocheting for long periods.",4
"This review is for: Virtegasas Horizontal Lazy Glasses Bed Prism Spectacles Lazy Readers Glasses Periscope Eyeglasses Upgraded Prism Glasses - For Reading and Watching TV in Bed While Lying FlatGot these yesterday. Pretty wild! They really do work. I have to say that it's pretty wild how your vision is separated through these two tunnels and your eyes still put the two images together, perfectly, like it's one image. Just a fun anatomy thing, I guess.I tried them two ways, close up and more of a distance. Laid flat in bed and looked at my phone. Vivid and crystal clear, just as if you were looking directly at your phone. While you can see a little but of something down the center of your vision in a way, it doesn't interfere with the object you're looking at and you can still see it clearly.Then, while still laying flat in bed, I tried watching TV. My TV is on a wall that is probably about 13 feet or so from my eyes. Still, the image was clear and I could see it perfectly.The only reason for 4 stars is that in both cases, the image is smaller and seems farther away than it is. I think this is just the physics involved with the image being reflected and there is probably no avoiding it. It's not too bad, but it is very obvious that the image you're looking at is smaller and farther away, seemingly. Maybe it's not fair to dock the product if this illusion is unavoidable, but 5 stars on these might convey that they reflect the image just as if it would be if you were looking at it directly, but it does not.Price is very reasonable at (currently) $13.99.I feel that these could be extremely useful in certain circumstances where mobility is an issue! If someone had neck troubles, etc., this would be a great solution.If I could give these 4.2 or 4.5, I would.I hope this was helpful.",4
"I love these and definitely recommend to anyone and everyone! Kind of heavy on the bridge of my nose and on my ears, but I'm not used to wearing glasses regularly so that is probably the cause.",4
"These bifocals stickers are good quality, rigid material, not flimsy and work great.......once you get them to adhere to your glasses. I ordered 2 sets and three of the stickers adhered fairly easily but the fourth one would not stay stuck. I had to reapply several times, which was easy to do, and the top edge of the sticker just will not stick. I finally decided it was as good as it was going to get and since I could still see thru the bifocal to read etc. I just quit trying to get it perfectly stuck. These are basically like putting a screen protector on your phone or tablet and have the same issues such as bubbles. There is also a definite right and wrong side to the sticker because they have a slight curve to them. If you have completely flat lenses on your glasses, not sure these would work. But once I got the stickers to adhere to my sunglasses they worked fine and I am happy with my purchase.",4
"They’re al little cheaply made, but perfect for what I wanted and the price. I use them all of the time. There are some blind spots and my glasses have fogged up, but I do recommend them!",4
"I bought these 2.5 diopter flip glasses for doing electronics work. I was tired of having to search my messy work area to find the other pair of glasses when I needed to change between reading my computer screen and being able to see what I was working on. That meant switching between some 1.5 glasses and and my 4.0. Since my search skills are horrible (I swear I can't find my own feet), this ate up a lot of time and patience.I love these! They are convenient and clear. They are easy to put on my drug store reading glasses. They work just like having two different pairs, without the searching pain.Yes, they are a little heavy. What would you expect. They don't have an anti-gravity mechanism to make them weightless. I had to tighten up the ear pieces on my 1.75's so the assembled pair wouldn't slide down my nose. But, they're not so heavy that they are uncomfortable.I need to get my wife her own pair for her beading work.",4
"I bought these lenses in January 2018. It is now August 2018 & I need to replace them. So I got about 7 months of HEAVY use for just under $13 -- not bad at all, but not quite great.The glasses are reasonably scratch resistant. Fairly light in weight so... comfortable to use. I flip them up & down a lot -- down for reading, up for conversations & other activities. The spring holding the lens when flipped up is still working just fine. However, the spring that holds the lens in place when it is flipped down, so as to be against my glasses for reading purposes -- that spring has lost some power. As a result, the lenses ""sag"" away from my glasses, just a quarter inch or so, when I tilt my head to read or do cloose work. It's a minor annoyance but spoils my concentration at times. So I just bought a replacent pair of lenses.The lenses themselves are great. Flip lenses are a good idea for people who, like me, make frequent shifts between close work & other activities. With lighter use these lenses would surely last longer. Even so... 7 months of heavy use for under $13 -- I can live with that.Aloha to all from Hawaii.",4
I do wear these all the time. I like that they have a pair of sunglasses too because I am always reading outside.I can use them only in my home for the 'one power' like looking up at the TV from my computer or book. It does not work when I'm driving at all.,4
"These are built pretty well. Not sure how they work. They do not seem to adjust from low to high, but I can wear them all day or just to read, and all is in focus. A mystery! Still a huge value here.",4
"These have lasted the longest Ive ever had a pair...going on 3 years hanging on my shirt collar every day. a little pricey, but you get what you pay for.",4
"The glasses fit great and work well for my intended purposes. The only problem I had was that the left temple was bent and almost broken. I was able to fix this without breaking the temple. The packaging was a ziploc bag inside an envelope, with no real protection against being crushed.",4
Fit well and and are as described. Non- Bi-focal readers that allow for ease of use.,4
"We recently purchased a 1934 Spanish Eclectic that needs not only restoration of it's former architectural integrity, but an addition to make the home work for us. This book was a good choice to provide us with a photographic ""library"" of Spanish-style homes to reference. I do wish there had been more devotion to the ""casitas"" section of middle-class homes and less to buildings dedicated to government or business; and perhaps more photographs of interiors. But it's still a great find and a wonderful addition for anyone who collects either books on architecture in general or on California architecture specifically.",4
"Hard to find these days, but worth picking up. Lots of hidden goodies on here. Can't go wrong with Sepultura's ""Chaos B.C."". And the run from Crawlspaces ""My Ruin"" all the way up to Cubanate's ""Oxyacetylene"" is full of awesome. Alien Factory's ""Higher"" is one fast paced track that fits at home at any rave. And Crystal Method's ""Come2gether"" is good not matter what mood im in.If you avoid the warts (Like G/Z/R's 'Outworld'), you have a good time with this CD.",4
Timely service and as described. I really prefer to know the editions publish date as I seek issues from 1999 and newer if possible.,4
Escape from Alcatraz depicts the full history of this infamous prison stronghold. It reflects how life was on the Rock and details the circumstances when and how 23 convicts attempted or succeeded in escaping from the island prison - the latter few never to be ever seen or heard of again. If you are interested in Alcatraz you need go no further than reading this book - it is really that good !,4
This is a beautifully conceived and photographed book of faces of people of mixed races who are wholly American. On the facing page is a handwritten paragraph of how they see themselves. It's wonderful.,4
"Great book -- I just wish it was longer! I gave a copy to my sister, who has two daughters adopted from China -- so although her kids are 100% Asian, it is likely she will have Hapa grandchildren. I also gave a copy to a friend whose husband is from the Phillipines and has 3 beautiful Hapa children --- they liked the book so much, they bought copies for their children and grandchildren. Beautiful photography, and wonderful insights into being part Asian, 100% Hapa, in an anglo world. My favorite quote is from the boy who said he is 'part Danish, but I usually don't tell people that because they think I am a pastry'.",4
"I am 100% Hapa, i was born and raised in Hawaii and i am very familar with the term and pleased to see it making its way into mainstream culture. I bought this book as a fathers day gift for my husband who is always asking why our first son looks nothings like him (he is Irish) and i am Hawaiian-Irish-Portugese.I only wish that the title of the book was more inclusive of Hawaiian and Pacific islanders who are also Hapa and originated the term.",4
"This mirror fit our mirror frame perfectly; however, the first time that door was shut it fell out and shattered. We used the adhesive system that came with it. Next time we'll use gorilla glue instead!",4
"The book overall is quite out-dated but it's message still has a singe of relevance. While world history is a fascinating subject, the history of your ancestors is even more fascinating. A powerful message that should not be forgotten.",4
"Before picking this book up to read I was aware of the knowledge I needed on African American's in the Education system. After reading it I felt empowered and sad. Empowered because now I had a little more knowledge and saddened because now I know what was kept from me all my school years. It amazes me how we were not taught any of our history not even in college. It also amazes me how people got away with not educating us.Dr. Carter shows us how 30 years ago the system was designed to keep us ignorant and as experiments. Quote from Dr. Woodson ""Negroes, being objects of charity, have received them cordially and have done what they were required."" To this day they are still using the same system but I think we are smarter now and know where the resources are to get what we need.Reviewed by Missy",4
"I am a twenty-four year old African American man and I read this book six years ago, and even at that young age I found it ""On point"". Dr. Woodson wrote this book over 60 years ago and his observations of social and educational conditions hold true to this day. This book was my introduction to my continuing studies of African American history, and I recommend that anyone beginning their studies begin with this book. There will be many instances when you will nod your head in agreement with what is stated, and other times when you will learn things about your own behaviors that you could not previously understand. The only reason that I couldn't give this book five stars is because it is a scholarly text and it is a little difficult for less sophisticated readers.",4
"The negative, incredulous readers/reviewers should read Psychiatry: The Ultimate Betrayal by Bruce Wiseman as the companion to this book. It very well may change your mind about your opinion of this work and others like it.",4
I stumbled upon this book while researching a different subject. Wow! Everyone should read this book. So enlightening. People of all educational levels will benefit from the wisdom of Mr. Woodson.,4
"I found this book to be very informatative and I was pleasantly surprised by all the valueable information that was within the pages of this book. What impressed me the most was the wealth of information concerning the African American people, especially the male gender. I brought this book because I am studying the Hebrew roots of the Christian faith and this book has clarified many questions I had about why we such a hated race of people. I wish I could buy this book for ever black male and female who is not proud of who he or she is because of a lack of knowledge of our heritage, which has been stolen from us way back in the 1600's which is actually 15th century and has been replaced with the Europeans. If you have no identity than you will become what others say your are. This book should be taught to every black elementary student as a History course so that they will come to know who they really are and where they come from.",4
"Overall, the HomeRight Auto Wash Stick works well on flat surfaces but if your car has wheel well mouldings, fender flares, spoilers, air dams, roof racks, or just about anything not flat, I find it hard to get those areas. And many places can't be gotten to no matter what. It earns a 4 star because where it can be used it works pretty good. If your car is an easy car to wash then perhaps you will really like it. Mine is a hard one to wash so when I get done, I let it dry then go back and wash the areas I missed by hand. Even with that, it's still easier and quicker than washing the whole thing with a sponge. Plus the long handle makes it easier to do the roof without stretching or reaching and the lower areas without stooping. It feels a little light duty and I worry how long it will last, but if it holds up well I would probably buy another.",4
"The backing for the mitt has a slight curve and fairly soft flex that does a surprisingly good job on and around door trim. Uses more washing solution than hand washing, but that is the only negative.",4
This puzzle was an impulse buy. But was well worth it. The pieces are large and on knobs so my little one was able to use it easily. There are only three pieces so its easy to store and keep it all together.,4
"This is a good first puzzle. It is great for practicing fine motor and hand-eye coordination. Also, my son is 12 mo. old and likes to chew everything. This puzzle is sturdy and he doesn't chew away the pictures!",4
"I purchased this product 2 years ago and still use it now and then. The smooth rollers are comfortable to grip w/o over heating your hair and fingers. The rollers form a medium curl and the clip helps smooth out frizzies. I give this product 4 stars only because the clips do not hold tight enough. I find them easy to loosen or fall out even if I am sitting still. I have long, thick, wavy hair so the roller clips may hold thinner hair better; although, that may be the ones that end up with the crease.",4
"This is perhaps the 5th set of electric style rollers that I have owned. It's probably the best, in that it heats up very quickly, which is, after all, why I use this type of product. It also has the same flaw that most electric rollers have, which no fool proof way of fastening them so that they stay in the hair. This product has a squeeze clip that fastens over the roller, once it is wrapped with your hair. It also heats up, to transfer heat to the hair from both the inside and the out. It also will leave a ""crease"" in the lock of hair, from where is clips on. No way to avoid it. I use the rollers along with a curling brush, to smooth out the crease in the front, which fixes the problem for me. Meanwhile, if you use electric rollers in general, this set is quick, and delivers a firm curl in a reasonably short period of time.",4
"I love this! Works great and is so easy to use.The big selling point for me is IT HEATS UP FAST! My old unit takes FOREVER to heat up. I just can't wait that long in the AM so I haven't used it for a long time. This heats up in less than 2 minutes.There are more than enough rollers for my hair and I found it easy to wrap my hair around them. My hair doesn't snag on these rollers at all. The clips hold my hair perfectly and after about 10 minutes I take everything off, I spray my hair and I have a head of beautiful bouncy curls.And this thing is going to last for a long time as it's very well made and high quality.But, there's no way I can keep it on my bathroom counter. It takes up a bit more space than I have free. So, I set it up on a shelf and that works fine.I appreciate having a space in the back of the unit for the plug. No more dangling cords!I'm really happy with this.",4
"Anthony Robbins is a powerful presenter. And he has a lot of practical good advice in these CDs. They are a bit pricey but...I found it useful to play each CD twice, really absorb what he is saying. I also try to go back every two or three months for a refresher session. And don't forget to keep the daily journal he recommends.If you are serious and put in the time, it will help you. It's a way of life not a one shot experience. It takes practice and commitment to implement his ideas, to succeed.So what else is new?Bottom line: this set is a useful self-improvement tool. But be sure to devote the necessary time to incorporate the ideas into your thinking and your actions.Good luck!",4
"Use to like him when I listened, is good for getting you fired up. Not sure what to think of him getting divorced after all his marital bliss. Oh well its a concept that if you stick with some good things may happen!",4
"I loved this product for a while, but now my baby who's just over a year pulls them off any surface and I keep having to press them back down and try to distract him from pulling them. Still preferable to the restaurant table surface though.",4
"This book provides introductory passages that illuminate the art of Tai Chi Chuan, and set a beginner on a path to cultivate internal energy. Translations of famous masters take up another chapter. The book covers all of the major styles, although the illustrations for each form(except for the simplified form) are probably meant for informative purposes only; they're not detailed enough that the reader could learn the form from studying the illustrations. Including chapters on martial applications, further combative situations involving the gentle art, weapons, meditation and Taoism, this book is probably the most thorough Tai Chi Chuan book out there. I highly recommend it.",4
"I got this cd player because I had such a hard time finding lullibies on tape. I had read the other comments but thought I would give it a try anyway.Bad points- It DOES skip when its hit, so don't hit it. The light IS dim, so what? I want the kids to sleep not see what to get into! The music IS low even on the highest setting, but then again the whole house isn't listening to it.Good points- It plays the whole CD then shuts itself off. (At least mine does!) It uses CDs which can be found ANYWHERE. Its small enough that I can put it on the wall side of my crib and I know my other children CAN'T play with it!! The buttons are a pain to get to, but thats GREAT where kids are concerned, right??As for the batteries, I've had mine a few weeks, play it EVERY night and have yet to replace the batteries.I happen to really like mine. Give it a try, save your receipt and make up your own mind.",4
"I really like this CD player. I do not understand why it has such a low review.*Yes the light is dim but I did not want a bright light. It is a nightlite. It is just fine. I can check on baby and see him fine.*The volume does not get very loud but for what this is designed for it is fine. I put in a lullaby CD and he drifts off to sleep.*The timer function if great.*The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I wish the digital readout and the buttons lite up. It is hard to see in the dark and I do not like to turn on the light to see the buttons and digital read out. Maybe in the next version the manufacture will include this.*As far as the CD's ckipping when hit, I solved that by sliding a piece of foam between the play and the rails of the crib. No there is no space to move at all and it does not skip.***It is not perfect but it does the trick!***",4
"I love my cd player. My baby uses it every time she goes to sleep...at night and for naps. I like it cause it shuts off itself. I gave it 4 stars cause I wish it would play louder,...but it truly is worth buying!",4
"Even tho these crib CD players were manufactured quite a while ago, they are still available; I bought mine at a Goodwill store. It was wonderful when our grandchildren were in cribs, but they still enjoy it when they come to spend the night. I guess it never occurred to me that an infant would need stereo sound. The volume level is sufficient for an child, since the idea is to lull the baby to sleep and not to ruin the child's eardrums. The nightlight is just enough for a child to feel safe, and yet not bright enough to keep him/her awake. Yes, it is difficult to replace the batteries but as any grandparent can tell you, if something is hard to open, give it to a child. I wouldn't want it to be easier, for safety reasons. Our 6 yr old granddaughter is staying the night and is thrilled that I found the missing CD player which I can hook onto a standard headboard.",4
"My husband and I wanted to buy this for our kids to play the lullabye CDs people had given as baby gifts, but we couldn't justify paying $50. I happened to find a used one at a rummage sale for a dollar! Much more reasonable.PROS: plays any CD; good volume control for a crib (a baby doesn't need surround sound to fall asleep); battery compartment is secured well; ""C"" batteries are best as rechargeables for something like this, since it's used every day; optional timer and programming buttons are good to customize baby's routine; dim nightlight is just enough for you see where the pacifier fell while you reset the music in the middle of the night without waking babyCONS: PRICE; CD door takes two hands to open and is noisy; I kind of wish it had a optional wall-mount or desk base for post-crib use",4
I really love this player; the light is just right for a baby; the sound is very good;I can hear it playing in the baby's room from my room at the other end of the house. My only complaint is it is hard to open but in a way that is ok too; we don't want the baby playing with it! I highly recommend this item. I may have to buy another because my 8 year old uses it after the baby is asleep!,4
"I really dont agree with the other reviews on the cd player. I can hear the player on high from a good distance and really only use the player when she is going to sleep, so how high does it have to go? I dont keep it on high as not to keep her awake, and the only issue is the light doesnt shine as bright as I thought. I keep it attached to the crib not near her head either.I dont get what the other reviewers dont get. Mine works great",4
"This book is good at first part, which provides the basic understanding on cryptography. But it is not understandable for the second part on modern algorithms and public key. I still cannot understand the advantage of modern algorithms over the ancient cryptography.The chapter Key Management seems to long for such a small issue, while the modern algorithms seems to short for such a big issue.",4
"If you want an accurate introduction to the concepts and vocabulary of cryptography, this is the book for you. The authors are clearly knowledgeable but manage to make the information provided accessable to the beginner. There are simple examples to acquaint you with some of the principles of coding and breaking codes. This is a complex subject and some of the ideas will take you into deep water. There is an excellent bibliography that one can refer to for more technical details. The book would benefit from a glossary of acronyms as some of the terminology was hard to keep straight. There could have been a little less discussion of key management. Over all a very useful and informative book.",4

"My four year old enjoys receiving Ladybug magazine in the mail. It has sweet little stories and is somewhat entertaining. However, he much prefers National Geographic Kids and High Five. Not sure whether it's the nature of the content or the style/layout, but it's not the biggest hit in our house.",4
"We just got our first issue of Ladybug Magazine. My 2 1/2 year olds enjoyed it, but I think some of the stories in there are for older children, probably a year older than mine are. That said, the publisher does give a range (2-6, I believe)and I do think that the kids will grow into enjoying all the features of the magazine. Its nice to have something other than Highlights, which the kids also enjoy.",4
I am a primary teacher and I was looking for books to use with my higher readers. This series of books was suggeted to me and I am very thankful. My first graders love them and I am working on buying the complete set.,4
"A group of kids awaits a book signing with their favorite mystery author, Wallis Wallace. But the author never shows, and the kids find it strange. As they follow clues, they think Wallis Wallace has been kidnapped.I like this book because it's pure kid imagination. It's what kids wish would happen. Who didn't want to be part of a mystery crew like on Scooby Doo or this A - Z Mysteries crew? The start to this series is imaginative, fun and keeps you interested.",4
"The best part of this lens is that it is stabilized and f/2.8. I can take had held shots at weddings regardless of the lighting.The downside is that it is not nearly as sharp or high quality as a L lens. It sucks a lot of dust inside which doesn't affect the pictures but could eventually be a mechanical issue. It is not sharp until around f/8 and does not handle contrast or vivid colors as well as L glass.I would recommend buying this if you need to take hand held shots with a zoom, in low light. Otherwise buy a L or a couple primes.",4
Overall it's a very good lens butts for the price make sure you really look before you buy these lengths I'm not upset that I bought them because I do video shooting but for that money it's not worth it it got better and cheaper lens out there that gives you the same type of quality,4
"I am very pleased with this lens. Last week I took approx. 700 pictures on a trip to Iran, mainly using this lense. The IS, together with the f/2.8 makes it a very good indoor lens. I some of the museums you are not allowed to use flash; this lens is solving that problem.I believa that the softness I expire in the photos is because of my D40 camerahouse, not the lens.What I am missing:- the weather-proofing you get on the L-series- the Lens Hood should be a part of the (expensive) lens- A pouch should be a part of the (expensive) lens",4

"Heinrich Boell's ""Ansichten eines Clowns"" is a fresco of postwar Germany, a very different landscape than today's. Boell's generation were tortured by remorse - and justly so; remorse humanized them. This is a novel about pain, loss and ethics: individual ethics and collective ethics; about how Hans remains faithful to his beliefs to the bitter end, about how Marie takes the path that she has to take. Together with Guenter Grass's ""The Tin Drum"" (published four years earlier), the ""Clown"" is the greatest novel of the Erhard period.",4
As a layperson I cannot comment on the accuracy of the translation but it reads elegantly and the ethos and sometimes pathos of the writers are blatantly palpable. They can be read aloud easily as they most certainly were intended for such a purpose. Two of the writers (Clement of Alexandria and Ignatius of Antioch) quite likely had direct contact with the original Apostles. The Didache may predate the gospels. In any case this collection gives a good glimpse of Christianity at its very early form. Essential reading indeed.,4
"Very good introduction to the writings of the apostolic fathers. However, I feel it was a major oversight for the author and/or publisher not to include the Epistle of Barnabus and Shepherd of Hermas in the book since these two documents are crucial to the study of early church literature. Apart from this obvious mistake, a very good book.",4
"Swindoll is always a gifted writer giving special insight to the reader. ""Esther"" brings to life the struggles and emotions one faces in life's difficult situations.

"Having ordered this book as ""new condition"" I was disappointed when it was delivered and all the corners were slightly bent. I don't mind that it was only slightly damaged. I do mind however that it was advertised as ""new.""",4
"This is a much needed tool for potty training! The only thing we would change is the ""potty guard"". It should be higher so that it covers the private parts on little boys. Sometimes we end up with a mess.",4
This is working great for us. So far she's pee'ed (spelling?) a few times and does not feel uncomfortable sitting here. Definitely a great product.,4
"My son is just getting started, but he is now wanting to sit on the potty with clothes on about 5 times a day and today he did when he first woke up. The base is nice because it has a grip and does not slide easily. I like the pull out cup too. We got white so it will be the same as everybody and maybe he will feel he is doing the same thing as everyone else. I DO reccommend this potty.",4
"I have a 14 month old. He sits on it. He doesn't scream. he's not using it as a potty yet. He climbs on it and listens to his echo while putting his face into it. Seems comfortable, will be easy to clean, not to big and akward. I'm sure it will do the job",4
"I wanted a chair with a removable bowl, but now that I've seen my son grab it and attempt to dump it out, part of me wishes I'd have gone for a toilet adapter style.If this is the style you want though, it's durable and sleek in appearance (for a potty chair, anyway).ETA: OK, now I'm glad that the bowl is removable as we're using it more, but you do have to watch for spills. It cleans easily and my son finds it comfortable.",4
"My son is now 2 years 8 months, and we started out potty training on the green frog. It's known as ""ribbit"". Well ""ribbit"" wasn't very deep, and didn't have any type of rubber gripping on the bottom of it. He seemed to be getting way too big for it. So my biggest concern was depth, and height of the back. I still wanted him to feel safe, but not pee pee over the edge. I am very pleased with the depth of this one. It fits him really good now. I'm a little worried about it fitting for the next 3 months, but we're working on it and I hope that he is potty trained in the next few months. I like the bottom of this Baby Bjorn because it does have rubber edging all along the bottom edge so it doesn't slide around the bathroom. It also has a really good front potty blocker. I would especially recommend this for parents with boys.",4
"My kids love this potty, but it does leave a red mark. It doesn't seem to bother them and it goes away rather quickly. They like this potty better than sitting on the big potty.",4
"i returned a different potty same day to purchase this one. the other potty seemed more comfortable with a cushion seat but my daughter slid off the back side and seemed like if she went in it she would squirt out the front. this potty chair she could lounge in comfortably without me thinking she's going to fall off the back, i thought it would be hard but she enjoyed looking at a book on it. the only issue i had was she got excited and tried to get off of it by herself and hit the front guard, flipping over and going facefirst into our bathroom shelving. at first glace we thought she broke her nose right across the bridge. luckily she isn't scared of the potty and her nose is ok....i'm sure as she grows a little she will be able to get off easier but just a warning, i do love this potty a lot better than the first one we got.",4
"She's still being potty trained, but she likes to sit on the chair. Easy to clean. The only draw back is that she can play with the removable bowl. She takes it out. It's simple.",4
"My son was 17 months old when I ordered/recieved this item. He was just getting interested in the potty and trying to take his clothes off. When I got the package he was right there and he tried it out right away. he fits perfectly on it, but it is a little ackward for a beiginer. Now a month latter he is seasoned at sitting down on it and getting back up. He is almost potty trained and I am convinced it is because of this potty chair.",4
"I bought this for my granddaughter as she is starting to show an interest in getting those diapers off. She likes it. It wasn't boring or scary. Which is one reason why I decided on this chair, bright colors are more interesting to a tot. She has been sitting on it. But we aren't at the take off the diaper stage yet. I do think this will be perfect for her!",4
"When I began my research for a potty chair for my son, I had no idea how many things there were to consider! I really didn't want anything that made noise or had lights but we ultimately decided on this chair because of the one-piece splash guard since I learned that it wasn't uncommon for little boys to hurt their tender bits on other chairs. It is well-made and sturdy; it didn't tip when my son got on or off. I think the main thing it did was to give my son the confidence to use a potty - his feet stayed securely on the ground and it was stable and didn't slip around. He had no problem getting himself on and off of it and he liked the 'responsibility' of dumping the contents into the big potty (I liked that it was easy for him to do that, and easy for me to clean the bowl afterward).",4
"My 2.5 year old is a big kid, 40 lbs, 38"" tall. He needs a bigger potty chair, which this is. We have the smaller baby bjorn potty we were using but he can't keep his pee in it, he's just too big. I like that the potty cup comes out to wash, but it often sticks to his bottom as he stands up from it. We've had urine on the floor several times just because of this. I ask him to hold the white cup down when he stands up, he just gets over excited when he goes and stands up right away to look inside. He sat on one at a friends house that had a cover over the removable cup, which is by far a better design, but the high back on this one makes a nice spot for spending extended amounts of time on it as he reads and tries to go. All in all, I like it and would recommend it with reservations.",4
"The Babybjorn Potty Chair has many nice features. Easy to clean--supports child, compact sturdy and simple. BUT if your child is small (like mine) the guard on the front is cumbersome. My child can't not mount the potty himself and must be placed on the potty. When he tries to get on the potty he has hurt himself in ways that makes any male member of the household wince.",4
"has a larger ""drop"" opening than a convertible potty that fits onto a toilet seat and step; better chance of your child pooping into the potty as opposed to pooping on the rear of the sitting area. However, the sitting area on the rear is also wide. If your child sits all the way back, there's a chance he/she can poop on the seat.",4
"This potty is the best. My daughter can fit on it easily unlike her previous potty. It's not the most attractive potty, very simple/plain. Overall it serves it's purpose.",4
"This IS a great potty. Easy to clean and simple in design, HOWEVER, if your son has learned to stand up to pee, then be prepared for messes and spills over the bowl and under the bowl to clean up. Of course, we are teaching him to aim in the bottom of the bowl, but in the meantime, we continue to clean up under the bowl because he aims toward the backside of the potty, which then leaks underneath the top piece and onto the floor.I still give it 4 stars because of the simple design, and I love that you just lift the top part and clean/empty it. I would've gotten their one piece smaller potty, however, my son is 2 1/2 and a big boy, so I wasn't sure if he would fit on the seat.",4
"Doc Martin is a rascal that can't be kept down. In his tiny village by the sea, he now has to deal with a baby as well as the prospect of marriage, and the whole village is still at him with all of their inane problems. Just what will he do?Season 5 seems to bring a sense of humanity to the good doctor that I felt has been long in coming. His passion and knowledge is put to the test with the arrival of a new doctor and everyone in the village are at the ends of their sanity.The wit and dry-humor are well portrayed in this series and I look forward to the release of season 6 in the near future.",4
"I've enjoyed the series tremendously, they're very entertaining. The story line continues to grow, never boring. I zipped through Series 5 and am anxiously awaiting the next season.",4
"The four stars are for a couple of episodes where the DVD stops in places for a few seconds before moving on. I hope they don't become permanent!Otherwise, it would be 5 stars for a great series with great actors and stories.",4
"This is the book you need for creating and maintaining a solid and authentic classroom literacy program. ""The First Twenty Days"" alone is extreemely helpful. You can start small and grow as you feel comfortable. A little overwhelming at times but worth it!",4
This book has helped me tremendously with my new job as a teacher. Going to school did not prepare me as much as this book has.,4
"It's a big book and I've only skimmed it. But, I've already incorporated a lot of ideas into my classroom and my 3rd grade students aren't complaining...rather they're enjoying language arts. Of course, TAKS is not until February so time will tell if it works according to my state's standards.I'm excited about another F&P; product that I saw by chance in the principal's hallway. My admins have ordered the Word Study program. I'm sure this will really help me with the Word Study part of the total F&P; Reading & Writing ""system"" [which is what the Guiding Readers & Writers book is all about].",4
"Good vibe, a bit of a homemade musical quality, and A+ lyrics...makes you remember how good a good country rockin song can be...highly recommended",4
"i would wear it more often, but it is short, so i feel like i have to hide that fact by tucking it into a coat. i love the print, though.",4
"Janis Joplin rocks on this release! Jefferson Airplane are not usually good live, but in this instance, they've polished up their act to sound best on TV! Richie Havens has always had a special place in my heart and his performances here are good. Vanilla Fudge is nothing but pure 60's nostalgia, nothing more. They're not much live, to tell you the truth. I believe that's everyone, if I'm missing somebody, it's cause they weren't that memorable.",4
"One is hard-pressed to find such a well-crafted book as this. The melodramatic goings-on of the have and the have-nots as played out in this plot will have one yelling ""yes"" or ""no"" at every turn. While not a book of tremendous substance, it is a wonderful look back at a time when senses of decorum and verisimilitude ruled the young and the old, and one's standing in society was ultimately more important than one's happiness. If that is not enough to persuade you to read this book, then how 'bout: It's a really great read and you'll finish all 506 pages in a sitting or two.",4
"A post-magical apocalypse political thriller and story about succession and inheritance in several senses.Stewart writes beautifully and creates original, well-detailed worlds. There were two aspects of this book that didn't work so well for me: first, the political thriller plot became incoherent, and second, the Chinatown culture seemed stereotypical (martial arts, empty cups of tea, whatever). On the other hand, I loved his evocation of the North Coast forest, and the way the elegance of his descriptions is grounded by down-to-earth characters and moments of humor.I'd recommend this, but not as strongly as GALVESTON or CLOUDS END.",4
"I like Sean Stewart (disclosure) but think that Perfect Circle and Mockingbird are his best works. This is quite different from those books, but still and interesting read. Perhaps this is more comparable to Galveston.This is not a ""big world"" book. It focuses on two cities in a future where magic has become strong (but is beginning to ebb again) and the two different cultures these cities have and the differences between them.It has some very clever magic. Forests that are conscious and protect some of the characters and dead armies that lightly interact with the living.Ultimately, it is a little flat in character development, but an interesting read.",4
"Overall, very good. Lot's of helpful advice. My only gripe is that training charts are written in minutes, not miles (author assumes a 10 minute mile). While this is nice from a stop-watch point of view, for those of us who run faster (or in my case, slower) than a 10 minute mile, the book was unclear whether it's more important to focus on time or mileage in one's training....",4
"We bought this for our grandson, one for his home and one for ours in hopes of getting him to want to go on the toilet and rid him of his diapers. He is now just over 2 and no luck so far but we like the seat and we are sure he will some day soon.",4
This is a nice seat but the adjustable part in the back doesn't really work for our toilet. It's ok though since it stays on the toilet nicely and doesn't move around. Works great for our little boy,4
"Easy to clean. Stays in place (even w/o using the built-in ""lock""). Seems comfrontable. Splash guard could be larger (but let's be honest, unless you're putting a Jai alai cesta on there, not sure anything is really going to contain the misses of an active 2yr old boy!)",4
"I like the style and ease of this potty seat, but for my daughter, the hole is much too big. She squirms on it, and will not use it unless I am holding onto her-she starts to slip and fall in. I am having to end up buying a much smaller seat. Hopefully she will grow into this one. She is 2 1/2 and a little on the small side.",4
"Love this seat. My daughter is almost 3 and fits perfect on it. No slipping around and fits any size toilet. I gave it 4 stars because I feel it's a lot of money for a toilet seat, but it works better then the ""fun"" cartoon kind.",4
"Here is what I like about this:- you can adjust some fitting with the turn of a dial on the inside back of the seat so that it doesn't shift when on the Toilet (this way I can use it on different toilet bowls and it sits steady)- just one piece (that way things don't get in between the pieces), less mess and easy to clean- contoured etc and all the stuff they say in their descriptionWhat I wish was different: I wish that the seat was a little cushioned. If he's been on the potty for a while, poor thing has red marks on his butt. (it goes away, just don't like seeing that)",4
just starting out but the potty fits great on an adult toilet and is great for a boy sitting down.,4
"I would have given this product 5 stars for design, comfort and ease of use but quality was a big issue. As most moms who are potty training know, it's kind of messy. I was wiping down the potty seat with a Lysol wipe and the oval handle at the back of the potty seat cracked along the plastic edge. The potty seat can still be used, but it was disappointing considering the price. I probably wouldn't let this discourage me from purchasing the product. It's a great design that can be used easily and makes the potty look more comfortable for little ones.",4
"This was in between the bjorn potty and the real toilet and my son really didn't mind using the big toilet with this. He felt very secure. If needed, it's easy to take on a car trip for other bathrooms.",4
"Overall, I'm very happy with this product. No wonder everybody raves about it!The only feature that needs to be improved are the handles on the sides.This is quite a pricey toilet trainer and it deserves handles.",4
"Our daughter has been getting better at warning us when she has to use the potty, thanks to the reliability of this product. As other reviewers have noted, it does not move and is very stable.Pros:- if your child likes pink, your child will like this!- stable adjustable adapter- easy to clean: no soft cushion or other places for urine to accumulateCons:- for the price, it would be nice to include a hook designed to hold the seat, say...one that hangs over the edge of the water tank, or an adhesive mount on the side- no side grip handles",4
"This seat is great - it has a mechanism that fits it to your toilet so it won't rock or slide and is solid plastic construction, so it won't crack like the padded seats do (will definitely last through my babies and can be passed along in great condition). The pee guard doesn't work great for my baby yet (we EC and he's 13 months and small for his age anyway, so it'll probably do better as he grows). He feels safe on it, though, and can sit independently quite well and is similar in shape and feel to his Baby Bjorn Little Potty, so it works for us!",4
"We tried a couple of other options before finding this seat. It is far better than other potty rings b/c it clamps onto the toilet seat so it doesnt wiggle around. The others were hard for my son to balance b/c they moved back and forth on our elongated seat. This one solved that problem. It is also more contoured so it seemed a more comfortable fit for him.It is easy to remove and place. We did finally opt for a built in all in one seat when my son started learning to pee standing up because it was even easier to get out of the way but, for just starting potty training, this seat is quite good - a step above the other potty rings.",4
This potty seat fit on all of my different toilet seats without a problem. My son can sit on it for long periods of time without getting uncomfortable. He's on the younger side at 18mo and the fit is just fine for him. The splash guard could of course be a little higher but we haven't had any major issues with this one. It does what it's supposed to and the ability to adjust the seat for a snug fit is what makes this seat so good. Other seats have slid around and this one stays put.,4
"If you have a boy... this is the only one that would fit the needs. We tried three other brands before this one and while they had their own merits, none would understand a boys needs better than this one. Fits perfectly on the toilet and can be adjusted if needed.",4
This is a pretty good album. A few of the songs are tear-jerkers and tear-jerk they will. A very beautiful score for a very sad movie.,4
"Without revealing too much about my feelings towards the movie, the soundtrack definitely stuck out amongst the drama, crazy characters, and melancholic undertones of the film. It is a picture perfect example of where sometimes the music is so good, it steals the attention away from the film itself. Particularly noteworthy is ""Loverly Spring,"" a cracked-out, hyper-happy ditty about a little elf, and a jaunty rendition of a classical piece played during the final credits, which, unfortunately, seems to have been omitted from the soundtrack. ""Drive Away"" is also ridiculously catchy and perfectly dark for this bizarre film.Well done, Mr. Newman.",4
"This is a nice unit to carry in the shirt pocket. I hate the lack of an optical view, the LCD is NOT convenient for point and shoot type photos. Especially out-doors. This is a special purpose camera and is very good for posed in-door or nature shots. Also, in the practical use of this unit, it is best to crank it down to the 3.2 pxl mode, or other lower res. The close shots at 5 pxl are phenomenal, every detail of a product label for example is perfectly reproduced. Good toy, but I like my DSC-P73 for every day use.UPDATE: 3/08 Still going strong, batery life is excellent, I use it regularly to document daily events around the house, have a date stamped history of baking, cooking, re-model events and renovations. Also have on several ocaisions taken before and during pics of projects that are useful in re-asembly and restoration.",4
Very easy to operate. This camera takes beautiful pictures outside. The lighting has to be right inside.,4
"I wish there were photos of the insides on Amazon or Kensington's website. It has more room than I thought it would. The back is especially roomy - it's divided by the handle assembly, bit there's exactly enough room for my Bose QuietComfort2 case on one side and my laptop powerbrick and food on the other side.The inside main compartment has enough room for TWO 15"" computers (although only one would be padded), plus a few folders, mags or paperback books. Based on the ads and some other comments, I thought the styling might be too ""girly"", but it's not. The strap is hard to remove, so I just keep it short and leave it on. I was able to use the strap to attach it on my main luggage for wheeling through the airport. By itself, the handle is a good length (I'm 5'8"").",4
I love this case! I had recently cracked the entire back of my phone due to having a non- protective case on it. I ordered this otter box because it’s cute but also provides protection. It fits my phone perfectly and is very comfortable to hold. It has protected the camera in the back and is very durable - I don’t even have a scratch on it yet!,5
"I’ve been through a few phone cases for my iPhone 14 Pro Max and haven’t found one that fits it well (particularly around the rear facing camera)…until now! I don’t understand how so many different cases don’t fit something as popular as an iPhone (especially in the exact same place and way). The magnet is the right amount of strength too, not at all weak so holds on to my car mount, but easy to remove if you are intentionally trying to remove it from a mount or charger.",5
"I love this phone case. It’s not bulk or slippery and I love the shimmer. I also use a metal magnetic mag safe pop socket and it sticks amazingly. I’ve dropped my phone several times with this case on and it protects it. Otter box is great! I just bought a new one to replace my old one, which was about a year and a half old. They last a long time but it will yellow over time. I recommend replacing once a year to keep it looking clear and pretty.",5

"I wanted to buy another laptop for work purposes but also be useful for travelling and for gaming so I saw this laptop for sale during Black Friday! Excellent purchase! Here is my pros and cons after a week of owning this:Con:1. 1920 x 1200 FHD 165Hz Display is very much an downgrade against my Legion 5 Pro 16"" 2560 x 1600 IPS LCD 165Hz Display... But I guess with the parts offered, ASUS had to make some budget cuts somewhere I guess... (for the model I've chosen and not wanting to spend more than $1500 USD).2. Automatic MUX Switching is annoying... it optimizes which option to best suit for your current usage at the time (e.g. if you ran an game vs closing the game and brings you to the desktop). The automatic switch seems like its great and all but it ruins the display setting and when an game is playing, it switches again and sends you back to the desktop and ruins the display setting/resolution once more... Its best to just set it on the dedicated GPU option so you dont have to deal with this...3. Standard SSD Capacity is too low (again with cost saving measures but literally everyone these days just buy additional SSD stick anyways)... so snagged an SK.Hynix P41 SSD 2TB stick on sale to manually install for loading heavy application and games on there; really easy to install and easy to unscrew the back; there is an empty NVMe Gen4 M.2 2280 slot for you to install your SSDWorks Great after installing correctly and no Issues now! (make sure after install of SSD, just load into Windows and open up disk management to reformat (quick format! never full on SSD!) No need to tinker with BIOS setting...Do not tighten the SSD screws too much where the stick bends! thats incorrect! screw in ever so slightly so that the stick itself wont lodge out or move at all.Pros:1. RTX 4060 8GB - 140W Max TGP2. i7-13650HX - beats my Ryzen-7 5800H on my Legion 5 Pro3. RGB bar looks awesome!4. Battery 90WhNeutral:1. RGB Keys - heard mixed reviews on ASUS's design on this; of course, the Legion 5 RGB keyboard design is the best of the best but this is just okay and its not too bad in my eyes.2. Same weight and nearly the same dimensions as my Legion 5 Pro so portability is the same-ish but way better than my old MSI gaming laptop from 2017 where you can put this in your backpack and still have room to put other accessories and such.This is all I've noticed currently but either way, its a great mid-tier gaming laptop! I can run cyberpunk all max setting without issues or framerate drops and every other AAA game titles up to this point... This laptop should last an long time until AAA games becomes more graphically intense and requiring more processing power... but again this is the best you can get for your money and highly recommend!",5
I like that's nearly the quietest laptop compared to its competitors with same specs. also I'm impressedwith the GPU performance.maybe there's some coilwhine yeah but very minor to notice.overall I really like it!!,5
"The laptop performs well, with about 4 months of usage and it is still rock solid.",5
"I invested in the Amazon Basics Stainless Steel Comfort Grip Knife Set, and my kitchen experience has been nothing short of wonderful. This 18-piece set is a complete arsenal for all your culinary adventures. With each knife designed for a specific task, it's like having a professional kitchen right on your countertop.The first thing that caught my eye was the sleek design and the comfort grip handles. These knives not only look gorgeous on my kitchen counter, but the grip is so ergonomic that chopping has become a less tedious task. The brushed stainless steel handles offer a secure and comfortable grip, making the knives easy to control even during demanding tasks.The high carbon stainless steel blades are the stars of the show. They are stain, rust, and pit resistant, which is a testament to their durability. With a satin finish, they glide through ingredients with ease. The variety of knives in this set is impressive, catering to all kinds of food prep tasks like chopping, cutting, slicing, peeling, and much more.Now, while the knives are sharp and ready to use out of the box, I did notice that they might need frequent sharpening with heavy use. The good news is that the set includes a sharpening steel, so keeping the blades sharp and ready is not a chore.The rubber wood block that houses the knives is compact and stylish, fitting well in any kitchen setting. The set includes a chef's knife, bread knife, ham knife, santoku knife, utility knife, vegetable knife, paring knife, sharpening steel, and eight steak knives, all neatly organized in a rubber wood block.The affordability of this set is a cherry on top. It's a budget-friendly option without compromising on quality or functionality. The Amazon Basics Stainless Steel Comfort Grip Knife Set is indeed a valuable addition to any kitchen. The quality, the range of knives, and the price point make it a commendable choice. I highly recommend this set to anyone looking to upgrade their kitchen game without breaking the bank.",5
"I needed some knives for a horror movie I'm filming. I don't want people to die but I love making movies about it. I needed a block of knives that weren't good chef's knives but that we could use to film.They look GREAT on camera!!! Not the best for cooking if you're a chef but you already know that. They came sharp and even made the ""shink!"" sound when pulled out.If you actually care about good knives, get good knives. These are fine as a movie prop.",5
"I love the price of these. They're very basic, run-of-the-mill knives, but the product is well made. I needed a new set of knives on a budget (my old dull ones weren't very practical) and these showed up on my page. Very nice product for the price, allowed me to get a new set of knives on a budget",5
Great value for the money! You get alot of knives in this set and also many different types depending on the use you need. They are VERY sharp and cut beautifully,5
I am really happy with this knife set. The block is beautiful on its own and the knives are terrific. I would highly recommend this high-quality knife set.,5
Very sharp and pretty set,5
i got these to replace an old set that was missing(thanks honey) pieces. it's true apparently they don't make good gardening tools. I've been using them for a while now and can vouch for their build quality. they work very well and i use them every day. it's a lovely set and perfect for someone on a budget or a gift for the child who finally moved out... just saying.,5
"I love these knives! The block is nice, the craftsmanship really shines, and was sooooo happy with how affordable they were. Just be careful cause they’re hella sharp!",5
"No negatives. This faucet was super easy to install, and it looks great! I needed a way to dispense water from the under counter filtered water system without drilling a hole in the granite. This faucet is the perfect solution. It easily connected to the filter system (Aquasana) without any additional hardware. To dispense the filtered water through the cross bar simply pull the lever straight down. The quality of the faucet is high end, heavy duty and sturdy. I love the way the black and brushed nickel finish goes with my countertop. I also love how firmly the nozzle retracts and stays up without sagging down.",5
I wanted a nice looking faucet that I could use for reverse osmosis & regular water. This fit the bill. Gorgeous & functional! Don’t hesitate to buy it.,5
"Looks great 10/10 and a very easy installationLove that it doesn’t smear or get dirty fastFeels very durable and solid , water flow is amazing high flow and doesn’t leak at all",5
I have made the mistake of going the cheap route with kitchen hardware because brands like Moen and Kohler are always beyond expensive. Kraus feels like a well established brand that continues to try and sell quality products at a great price point. I also got a sink from them (amazon open box) and both looks amazing compared to what we had before. The filtered drinking water option is also a godsend.,5
"Great faucet, absolutely love it. Wanted to save on counter space so needed a faucet that combined RO into the same faucet. Have it for a while already and works great. No complaints at all.",5
Easy to install and very nice quality. Looks great in our kitchen.,5
"Have been using this for over a month now, and it's been great! Good build quality, looks great, and having the filtered water built-in as opposed to needing to drill a separate hole in the counter is really convenient (and works well)! I would highly recommend this faucet.EDIT: Following up again 7 months later, and this faucet is still great! It remains sturdy and still looks great.",5
"Very few kitchen faucets that include a dedicated separate filtered water tap. This saved me the toil of drilling a hole on my ceramic sink for a separate filtered water tap.Works well and is well built, albeit somewhat pricey. Mine was discounted as it was used, otherwise I would have been hesitant. In retrospect I would not have greatly regretted paying full price.Installation instructions were easy to follow.",5
"Perfect product if you have a RO system under the sink and you don't one an extra faucet. Looks really good, and minimal it's easy to install and to use.The colour is a true champagne gold and not as ""yellow"" as it looks in the pictures.",5
"This faucet is awesome for those who wants to add RO water to without drilling a hole. The nut design is super easy to install, it has two Philip screws that does the final tightening; brilliant.For me, I took the old RO water hole and turn it into a glass rinser.",5
"I'll cut to the chase for anyone who simply wants to know if Vitamix blenders are worth the investment. My answer is yes. Unequivocally.This is my second Vitamix. My first one (the 6300) is about 7 years old & STILL going strong, but I was happy to have the opportunity to try this new Ascent X4 because of the presets for many of the things I commonly blend. The 5 presets (smoothies, frozen desserts, soups, frozen cocktails, and last but not least, dips & spreads) take the guesswork out of which settings to use for many of the types of foods & beverages that I make on a regular basis.So far, I've used the presets on my Ascent X4 to blend smoothies & frappes and to clean my container when I've finished using it. (Btw, not that it was difficult to do this manually with my 6300, but I love the self-cleaning feature!) In addition, even though there's no preset for it on this model I was still able to make a great, super-smooth batch of almond butter with help from the ""dips and spreads"" setting, too!More things I love about the Ascent X series:- 10-year warranty -- almost unheard of these days- smart technology that tells me when I should use the tamper (if I'm not already using it)- clever tamper storage that conveniently fits on either side (I'll never need to hunt for it again!)- ability to blend manually without using a preset and includes a ""pulse"" feature- additional 15 seconds can be added with one touch on the ""15+""- motorized base accepts all self-detect containers, including a food processor (I can hardly wait to get that one!)- container is dishwasher safe (it self-cleans exceptionally well but some might like this option)- easy to see when it's *powered on -- lights appear on the display, or off -- no lights (*Btw, the power button is hidden on the lower right side of the base beneath the edge. I say this because I had trouble finding it myself, lol.)I'll end with the fact that Vitamix stands 100% behind their products and the company has STELLAR customer service. If there's any issue with your blender or its components it's easy to contact them by phone. Not only do you get to talk with a real person, but those who answer calls are friendly, knowledgeable & helpful. I speak from experience.",5
"I bought a Vitamix in 1999, and it's still going strong to this day. I have used and abused it over the years and it just keeps on going. I wanted to get a more modern version that has electronic optionsfor pre-programmed features like smoothies, etc. I have to admit that I was a little concerned that Vitamix would follow the trend of many popular, formerly high-quality brands by making products *look* better while lessening overall quality. I'm relieved to report that as far as I can tell, this machine is still a high quality machine that I would expect from Vitamix. The base and motor sounds feel and sound familiar... like an old friend. I love that even though there are pre-programmed functions, you still have the option to run the machine like an old Vitamix. That is, on/off and a dial to hone in on the perfect speed for what you're making. You can turn it on and go without having to navigate menus to find a ""manual"" mode. For professional chefs and experienced home cooks, this is important.The pre-programmed options are great. Combined with the extensive recipe book, you can make flawless recipes! If you're a beginner home cook, this machine could change your life.One thing I made all the time in my previous Vitamix is hummus, so that's the first thing I tried in the new one. And when I say I make hummus, I start by making tahini from sesame seeds and oil. The Vitamix handled this step flawlessly. In seconds, I had a beautiful tahini base for my hummus. Next I added chickpeas, lemon, salt and a bit of water. This Vitamix made a beautiful, super creamy and smooth hummus. I know some people like hummus that's a little rough, but I prefer a super smooth one and that's completely doable in this Vitamix.I was kind of hoping that in their years of R&D that they would have found a way to make it easier to get thick food like hummus out of the canister more easily, but that's a big ask. So I did have to use a spatula to get all the goodness out of the bottom.I have made some smoothies, mayo and potato soup -- all things my previous Vitamix did effortless, and this new model handles all these tasks without complaining. It truly is a beautiful machine and I'm really excited to keep using it and trying new things.My only concern for the future is the electronics side of things. I hope they engineered that as well as the motor and other physical aspects. With the old Vitamix, there are 2 switches and a dial. There's not much to go wrong as long the motor is working. And Vitamix makes powerful and quality motors, which is why my 25 year-old Vitamix shows no signs of slowing down today. Since I can't really test the electronics side of things, I'm really hoping they did put the R&D and build quality into that side of things as well.Overall, I'm super happy with this latest professional grade model and am so happy that Vitamix is still making high-quality and user-friendly products!",5
"I can now make dinner in a flash - and saves my sanity when chopping broccoli.No more mess in the kitchen, it works great and is of really good quality.Blades are sharp and I love the tool to protect your fingers which does not come with the other models I have seen.Does require some strength though - my kids struggle with harder veggies so I had to help.Popped everything in the dishwasher after use and made cleaning up so easy. We love it so far.",5
This chopper is awesome. I have a single chopper but this was is so fast and easy to use and clean.,5
"I have almost nothing to complain about with this kit. It cuts effortlessly compared to the cheaper one I used to have. Doesnt really matter what, onions, peppers, apples, carrots, potatoes, all of them go through it like a hot knife through butter. The ergonomics are great, I will say that I have yet to use the mandoline portion on top. Just haven't had a use case yet. But if the blades in that are as good as they are in the chopper, I don't doubt that it will have just as good as an experience. The storage for the blades is convenient and well thought out. I especially love the little comb that you can use to clean out the plate that pushes things through the blades. It makes cleaning up much easier than any previous chopper that I've used. My only real complaint about this is that the container that the chopped food enters is a bit too short. This both limits how much you can chop before having to empty the container, and it also prevents you from being able to fully close the chopper up with all the blades in their storage recepticles. Its a bit of a nitpick honestly. But it would be nice to have everything securely in one spot without having to worry about anything falling out if it gets tipped over.Other than that, great buy, highly recommend. Also I love the color!",5
"It’s sharp, easy to assemble, and saves time chopping vegetables. Highly recommend!",5
"I got this dicer for 50% off, I think, paying only $30 or so for a normally $60 dicer. This is the first dicer that I have ever owned, although I have used a friend's dicer, and I will say that this cuts through about anything that you would need to dice in the kitchen. Like most dicers, stuff gets caught and stuck in the blades and the platform thingy, and it's a little hard to wash, especially because those blades are seriously sharp. An onion stands no chance against those blades. All of the different tools/slicers are really awesome and work really well for the most part.It isn't quite as big as what I thought it would be when I purchased it, and to give you an idea, most of the time I need to quarter an onion in order for it to be diced correctly and not smush out of the sides. If it's a small onion, you can fit half of it in the dicing area and get it done that way. I am extremely happy with the purchase overall, especially at that price, and it has taken away a lot of frustration and time when I cook. Next time, I will probably get one that's a little bigger, but this is most definitely a game changer by itself. Highly recommend this dicer. Just be careful with those blades! They are super sharp and got two of us bleeding within the first three or four days. Lol",5
"This chopper is just awesome . Nicely built , no cheap plastic . And all blades are sharp .",5
Solid and great quality. The blades are thick and the plastic parts do not feel flimsy. Very useful.,5
Highly recommended,5
"The media could not be loaded. I recently upgraded my kitchen with the CAROTE 11-piece Non-Stick Pots and Pans Set, and it's been a game-changer for my cooking routine. The cream white color gives my kitchen a clean, modern look, and the non-stick surface truly lives up to its claims. Food slides right off, making both cooking and cleanup a breeze. I love that I can use less oil, and even delicate foods like eggs don’t stick, which makes every meal feel healthier and fresher.One of my favorite features is the removable handle, which is incredibly practical. It snaps on and off easily, so I can transfer pots from stovetop to oven or fridge without taking up extra space or needing separate storage for bulky handles. This space-saving design has been perfect for my small kitchen and would be amazing for anyone with limited storage or even an RV setup. Plus, the set is induction-compatible, which opens up a lot of versatility, especially if you have mixed appliances.Overall, this CAROTE cookware set has been an ideal addition to my kitchen. It's lightweight but durable, easy to clean, and does everything I need it to do, from stovetop to oven to fridge. It’s been a worthwhile investment, and I can tell it’s going to last me a long time. If you’re looking for a practical, stylish, and space-efficient cookware set, I highly recommend giving CAROTE a try!",5
"Absolutely amazing!!! Best purchase I’ve done in a while. The coating makes it super easy to cook and food really doesn’t stick, even with small amounts of oil or similar. The removable handles are great and easy to apply and remove. The color is lovely, the little dots give it a little extra something that looks very nice. The fact that you can take them from stove to oven to the table and they still look cute it’s definitely a great extra. Heat distribution is amazing! Everything cooks very evenly! The stacking makes is easier to store and they are also super easy to clean.",5
"I bought these to save my time in the kitchen, and the results are better than expected. I like the detachable handles, since they allow me to squeeze more pots on my stovetop, while eliminated bumping a handle and spilling the contents. They nest well in a drawer, using less than half the space required by my old pots. The non stick coating has held up very well, and I am saving more time than I planned when cleaning them",5
"“I am absolutely thrilled with this CAROTE Pots and Pans Set! The non-stick coating works flawlessly, making cooking and cleanup a breeze. I love the space-saving design – the detachable handle is such a clever feature, especially for storing everything neatly in my small kitchen and even fitting them in the fridge! The cream white color adds a touch of elegance, and the set is versatile enough for all my cooking needs. It heats evenly on my induction stovetop, and being oven-safe is a huge plus. This set has truly upgraded my cooking experience – I can’t recommend it enough!”",5
I've been looking at these for a while and finally gave in and got them. I have an issue with my pots and pans not being able to fit into the cupboard properly number one because they don't all settle into each other perfectly and the handles stick out. So far they seem to cook through very evenly they're heavy weight and easy to clean. They're very pretty looking and it's super convenient to have the handle store next to it. Also the lids are nice that they function is a cover and the whole pan and lid can be put into your refrigerator together or take into another person's house. It eliminates the need for Tupperware. For the price I have found these in extremely good buy and would recommend them to other people,5
"As an avid cook, I’ve been searching for the perfect pots and pans for a long time, and after trying many, I can't believe I didn't discover these sooner! These pots and pans are lightweight yet durable, with a non-stick surface that makes cooking and cleaning a breeze. I ended up discarding half a dozen of my old ones after using these. What I love most is how they store in my cabinet – the detachable handles allow me to stack them neatly, saving so much space. Plus, the inclusion of high-quality felt sheets for protection shows they really care about the product’s longevity. The price is great, and I will definitely buy these again as gifts!",5
"The media could not be loaded. I recently purchased the T-fal Ultimate Hard Anodized Nonstick Fry Pan Set, and it has quickly become a staple in my kitchen. The nonstick coating is impressive – even with minimal oil, food slides right off without sticking. This makes cooking so much easier and clean-up even faster, as I can simply wipe the pans with a sponge and they’re good as new. Another thing I love is how evenly these pans heat up; whether I’m cooking vegetables or frying eggs, there are no hot spots, so everything cooks perfectly. The set feels durable and well-made, with comfortable handles that stay cool while cooking. Overall, this set is an excellent value for anyone looking for quality, user-friendly frying pans.",5
"I'm doing an initial review of this cookware set. As it's being used, my intention is to come back to this review with updates.I ordered this set after doing a bit of 'googling' on what is the best cookware set for 2019 - I wanted something for our gas range. I think it's something to take into consideration when choosing what you're going to buy. An example - on a gas range - if the setting is high and your cookware has some sort of enamel-like finish, and the flames are coming over the sides of the pot/pan - it's going to discolor the finish after a period of time.I looked at the top 10 bracket, the top 5 bracket, I went to reviews, Good Housekeeping, Consumer Reports, just to name two of several, and surprisingly (at least for me) T-Fal was a set that kept popping up as one of the best. I've always thought of T-Fal as one of those starter cookware sets that someone might purchase when they're moving into their first apartment and starting out on their own - it is/was inexpensive - a set for a person learning to cook and therefore not requiring something more 'higher-end.' If you have/had those thoughts as well, you might want to set them aside, at least with this set..Upon pulling everything out of the box my first impression was they look really nice. The set is light weight - the handles are riveted, silicone encased and can withstand up to 400 degree oven temperature. The lids are heavy tempered glass, each one having a small vent hole, and the handles are also silicone encased as well. The design of the lid-handles seems to take into account the use of pot holders since there's substantial space between the glass and the handle itself. All of the lids in my set fit nicely onto their respective pot/pan - no warpage or bent rims. The pots/pans are dishwasher safe (mine aren't going to see the inside of a dishwasher), and this particular set you can use metal utensils (I personally ain't-a-gonna do it). It comes with a steamer that is designed to stack on top of the large pot (not the dutch oven). When you're done steaming, grab some pot holders and lift the insert out by it's handles - no muss, no fuss. It's a much better option than the collapsible steamer I currently using.It comes with instructions on how to care for your cookware. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS! Why you may ask? This set is replacing a Calphalon set, and yes Calphalon was/is rated highly as well. But why replace it? Because being the knuckle head that I am, I didn't read the instructions. I knew Calphalon had to be hand washed (at least the set that I own) - but what I didn't know was what high heat does to the pots. When you read the instructions for T-Fal, and because it's aluminum, it'll say something to the effect of using low to medium heat (because aluminum conducts heat really well). See … I didn't know that about anodized aluminum and what I ended up doing was burning the finish off of each pot and skillet bottom of my Calphalon set - right down to the bare aluminum and of course this affected the non-stick surface on the inside. So please, read and follow the instructions. One other thing before I wrap this up. When I was doing my 'research' I came across this one video of an owner showing how an empty T-Fal pot didn't sit level on her stove. Seems the handle was heavy enough that it caused the pot to tip. She said this was a problem - and I guess it could be if you're in the process of putting something inside the pot in preparation of cooking. I do get that - but I placed an empty pot on the stove, centered over the burner, and it sat just fine - although I'll say my stove grate is different than the stove in the video - it also sat level on the counter top. Perhaps this might be something to take into consideration???So initial impression is the set seems to be of good quality, looks nice, and I'm looking forward to putting this set through it's paces.UPDATE:As of December 4, 2019 I have to say that the T-Fal set has held up extremely well - cooking with this set is a breeze. I keep the burner setting usually at med-high if I want to bring something to a boil - and it doesn't take long for that to happen. The pots and pans conduct heat really well and there's practically no sticking. Usually I can pretty-much rinse off any food residue left behind using just running hot water. I'm pretty good at using either wooden or silicon-type utensils when cooking, though on occasion I've used metal spoons to stir, and there are no marks inside any of the pots/pans. I'm not one of those cooks adept enough to shift a pan around and flip the contents briefly into the air (my cool-factor is not that high) so ""skating"" the bottom of a pot/pan over the cast-iron grate has not taken place, so I can't say what would happen to this set if I were to do so. If I were to hazard a guess, I would say that more than likely there would be some marring of the bottom since cast iron probably trumps aluminum. Overall I'm very please with this purchase and the performance of this cook set.",5
"I try to wait on reviews so that I can provide an accurate and fair review. This was a great purchase. These pans look amazing and are very sturdy. Stick fee is 5 stars. Durability 5 stars. Look new after 6 months. Easy to keep clean. After 6 months no scratches or marks. I will admit that I an very careful about cleaning and us only cloth or sponge as I have ruined other, more expensive brands in the past.",5
"We all have some of these: chipped, scratched pots and pans that wobble on a range because of being WARPED. I've had enough with my pans and began research on cookeware sets. I will note here that my current cookware is the high end non-stick, with my fry pans being those bought after watching some fool on TV melt candy in a wrapper in the pan and then wiping it clean. (These pans by the way are only 8 months old and are already WARPED). For new cookware, my ONE main requirement was that they were or would be NON-WARPING. The second requirement was that they be non-stick. After some research I settled on the 14 piece of T-Fal non-stick / non-warp set. Item came well packaged and unpacking the items I was impressed with the feel of each piece: not too heavy or light even with a lid. I also noted the non-stick interior surface and the very nice looking anodized exterior. Very nice touch with the vented lids (an actual hole in the glass) and the FULL insulation of the handles. Now I mention this insulation because I have (had) cookware items that had decorative (?) metal ends on the handles that would occasionally get very warm while being used.( Nothing like grabbing a pot or pan handle that want to cook your hand medium rare.) I washed each piece and WITHOUT SEASONING, took the largest frying pan, placed it on the range on MED HEAT (about 5-6 on an electric glass top range) and let it heat up. After 2-3 minutes, I noted that the T-FAL center emblem in the pan really didn't look like it changed much. I expected it to go from the T-FAL logo to a full red dot. Didn't happen but it was no biggie as in the past several months I began preheating my fry pans for about 3 minutes due to their warped exterior. Next I added magarine as I was going to cook sunnyside up eggs. I was impressed to note that the margarine melted quickly AND when spread about the pan, little bubbles began to show up over the ENTIRE pan surface. This meant that the pan was heating up evenly. In went the eggs and after placing a lid on the pan I turned away to get something off the counter. Now, with my older warped fry pans I could do this same act, return to the range and begin to slowly rotate the pan to get even heating on the eggs. Not so with this T-Fal fry pan. I noted the whites turning opaque quickly and the yolks getting their whitish color meaning they would be just slightly runny. In short, these eggs came out perfect and in well over 1/2 the time from my old cookware. Even my other half was impressed. Now my next ""adventures in cooking"" will involve sautéing, making my alfredo sauce, grilling (this set came with a VERY NICE grill pan!) and frying. So far I am following the instructions by keeping the range heat at MED or just a bit more. Noted is that one foray into frying eggs does not provide enough experience with this cookware to turn cartwheels in the kitchen. But so far, with eggs being one of my more difficult items to make because of my other warped pans with uneven heat, this T-Fal pan is impressive. So, my rating of 4 is tentative as I will update this review within a short time after I try other pieces of this set.UPDATE:First this disclaimer: I HAVE NOT and AM NOT an employee of T-Fal or Amazon, and I have NOT been hired to write a raving review. That said, now for the update. I have had this set now for over a month and have used all but one of the pans. The total experience has been incredible. I cook out of self-defense (the other half is banned by the EPA from boiling water) and am pretty fast in the kitchen when I am cooking.- WEIGHT OF PANS: I thought the pans were a bit on the light side until I started using them. Whether it was thought of during design or not, the pans are heavy enough to withstand various cooking requirements but light enough where you don't break your wrist when lifting.- NON STICK SURFACE: Come on now! Who in their right mind melts plastic spoons or uses an electric beater on their non-stick cookware! I believe surface of this T-Fal would take this abuse with no problem, but I happen to like my food without the taste of plastic. I've used nearly all the pans and found them all to be amazingly non-stick as well as sturdy. I still use butter/olive oil when sautéing or frying. I have had nothing stick to the pans nor have any of these pans lost any of their non-stick capability.- HEATING: This is the BEST part of this cookware. If you cook/have cooked with slightly warped cookware, you know the problem with hot heat spots or very little heat at all. Thus, you have to move the pan around a bit to get yours items cooked. Each of the pans in this T-Fal set has VERY even heat distribution. There is a ""plate"" on the bottom of the pans that distributes the heat evenly. I have found that because of this, I've noted shorter cooking times on various items AND I now cook on a lower heat settings NOTE: This T-Fal cookware set will cause you to change how your cook and for how long. The even heat distribution is stunning. ALSO, I do preheat my pans (except for boiling water) and use only wooden or high heat tolerant silicone utensils..- STORAGE OF THE COOKWARE: I don't stack this cookware. Instead I hang it up. This simply helps prolong the life of my investment.Overall, I am very impressed with this cookware. Even my other half (known for making ANGRY little pellets called hamburgers), has begun to learn that this cookware can even make her a decent cook. And yes, I bit on the late night adverts showing the frying pans melting plastic spoons and candy in wrappers and magically not sticking. I bought 3. Within 90 days they either lost their non-stick capability, began to warp, or both.Some people are gourmet cooks; others have trouble boiling water. This cookware will holdup very well and serve both very well. My motto is that you get what you pay for. And you WILL get more than you've paid for this set. I raise my rating to 5 stars and I do recommend as a BUY.",5
This set of pots is amazing!! They are truly non-stick which makes cooking and cleaning easier. They are worth the price. I would recommend this set to others.,5
"I've had these for a few months now and they have been fantastic. They seem very sturdy, they are easy to clean and everything I've made in them has cooked evenly and nothing has stuck to the pans. I am very happy with this purchase.",5
"While I can't give you a review on durability yet, I can say they seem nice. All parts cake in that I know of. The silicone seems sturdy, I like the fit of the lids and it stacks rather nicely imo. I don't see how a bowl wouldn't be functional, there's really no way to mess that up. I ordered black and think they look pretty sharp. The tools that came with it are small imo also but I wasn't expecting much, they were just kind of a bonus to me really.Enjoy",5
"These bowls and lids are great. I love the shredder and slicer and they clean up easily in the dishwasher. I recommend placing the lids on the top dishwasher rack to ensure the lids maintain their shape but even on the bottom they maintain their shape and seal if you place them on the bowls and leave them on for a while. The sizes allow you to measure, mix, and store right in the bowls. The silicone base is the best feature and provides a firm foundation as you mix vigorously. The extra measuring tools and silicone utensils are a nice bonus. Would buy again as a gift!",5
"Great set of bowls, the rubber bottom really does a great job of keeping it from sliding. Nice variety if sizes, the lid seals well enough for me to use them for storage as well as mixing. I have been washing them in the dishwasher since I got them with now issues. They store easily as well.Some issues with scratching on the insides if the bowl but not a concern",5
"I've been trying to get rid of my glass mixing bowls and I wanted something durable that wasn't plastic. I saw this set and I gave it a try. Best purchase I've made in a while... I LOVE THEM! Durable with a nice rubber bottom. The lids fit like a glove and they are perfectly stackable. The bonus... is the bowl with the slicing and grating attachments. All I do is open the covered hole on the lid, add the attachment and I slice and grate in the bowl. Save me time and clean up. It came with some silicone utensils, measuring cups and spoon. This was a true bonus buy!",5
They look nice! They fit in my cabinets perfectly. They are good quality and can be used for many things. They work good and are easy to clean. I would recommend these if you like to bake they have many sizes.,5
"I got this to take camping. It works great, love how the bowls stack together. Love the non-slip bottoms. The extras - utensils, measuring cups, etc - where great to throw in our camping tub. The lids aren't water-proof, so if you are bringing stuff home in a cooler full of melting ice, keep that in mind. Otherwise, we love it!",5
"There are many items included with this purchase. The utensils are pretty small, but it all works. The use of the cheese grater and other items is nice to have.",5
I love the size and colors,5
"This is the second one I purchased for gifts; I use one myself in the kitchen. I'm a knife collector, as far as chef knives go. A $200 one will not be better. It has a VG 10 core for edge retention. It looks good. Its high chromium/ Nikkel content makes it rust-resistant. It's full-tang, and, best of all, it's very sharp. Quality, appearance, value, weight, balance, comfort, ease of use, ease of cleaning; It's all there. This is a knife every kitchen should have. Highly recommended.",5
They seem to hold an edge and sharpen well also. a good medium priced tool.,5
I started home cooking and got this knifeIt is smooth cutting meat and vegetablesIt’s almost 3 months but still works like the first day,5
Gorgeous blade and exceptionally sharp that holds an edge even with an aggressive bevel.Full tang blade and is surprisingly weighty but no so unwieldy as to be clumsy.It will be the first knife in the drawer you reach for. We all have that one tool that just makes your life easier.,5
Wonderful cutting edge. Also it is sent in a beautiful box which works well for storing the sharp blade.,5
"I seen a few negative reviews about rust, FYI moisture is the worst enemy to this type of steel.Here is how to care for your Damascus Blade. I collect Katanas, which are all Hand Forged blades.FYI: the picture of knife darkens the blade so you can see the Design.When heat treated and used in a blade this combination holds an excellent edge. The blade will gain an attractive patina with prolonged use as with any Carbon steel based blade. The colour and character of the patina is determined by the type of ingredients and food the blade is used to cut. For example, cooked red meat creates a beautiful blue-grey patina that will be familiar to anyone who has encountered heirloom carving knives.Caring for your blade:Caring for a Damascus steel blade is much the same as for a Carbon steel blade - moisture is the enemy. Once the blade has built up a patina it is much more forgiving, but a fresh Carbon steel based blade will begin to rust in a heartbeat.Never, ever: NEVER!Leave the blade resting in standing waterRest the blade on a damp tea towel, wash cloth, etcStore in direct contact with leatherWash in a dishwasherTo help your Damascus steel knife become a heirloom, there are only a few things you need to do.After use:Rinse clean under running water and wipe dry with a clean clothLightly oil using food safe oilStore in a dry placeWhile your blade is still developing a patina, it is a good idea to quickly wipe the blade down before moving on to a food preparation task not involving the knife.Oiling - (I use Japanese Sword Choji Oil)- https://www.amazon.com/The-Institute-of-Asian-Arts/dp/B0061LS2SY?th=1&psc=1A common mistake when oiling a blade is to use something like olive oil that will go rancid. I recommend Choji oil, as it is food safe, cheap, and readily available.WashingMany people new to Damascus steel knives approach washing their blades with trepidation. Cleaning your knife is straightforward: rinse it under running water, give it a wipe with a lightly soapy dish sponge, rinse it again and wipe dry. If you’re familiar with the term “Bachelor Wash” (or can decipher the connotation), this is all it takes.Refreshing the patternThe Damascus pattern will fade with use - this is normal and easy to rectify. Hot black instant coffee (cheap, nasty, and mixed at a ratio that would kill a large animal) is a mild etchant that is used as the final stage of the Damascus etching process. It is element of process that contributes most to the blackness of the pattern.Here’s how to refresh your own blades:Brew a batch of the cheapest and nastiest black instant coffee you can get your hands on. You’ll need enough to immerse the blade in.Wash the blade, then thoroughly wipe it down with methylated spirits to remove oils and contaminantsImmerse the blade in the instant coffee, heating the coffee back up if it’s gone cold (heat increases the rate of reaction). Take care to avoid getting coffee on the handle.Expect the process to take anywhere between 15 minutes and an hour. Check the blade every 15 minutes by removing it from the coffee and allowing the coffee to drip off. Do not touch or wipe down the blade at any point.When the desired results have been achieved, remove the blade from the coffee then wash as normal before oiling and storing.",5
Very good Quality,5
"The media could not be loaded. The best part is the smooth gliding RAZOR edge this knife has out of the box. It's a Chinese made VG-10 steel, damascus style (I can't verify how many layers this really has), but VG-10 steel has a great reputation. The knife shipped OVERNIGHT and by coincidence, I bought fresh Walleye AKA Pickerel today at the grocery store. I've used a survival knife to do this before, but it left way too much meat on the skin. This knife just slid right through. If you're OK buying a knife made in China, I'd pick one of these up. The hype is real.Downsides:1) Nobody can really say if this is damascus or just damascus style, nor have I used it for more than one task, but without seeing the manufacture process, it may or may not be.Fun facts:The VG10 steel is native to Japan. 9CRMOV10 or whatever the top rated Japanese knives are made of is a Chinese steel, copying the VG10. How can a genuine Japanese chef knife (like most of the top rated ones) be made out of a Chinese composition steel, yet still be Japanese? This Japanese STYLE chef knife is made from higher grade steel than any of the Chinese 9CRMOV10ABC steel used in most top rated competitors and it's cheaper.Good stuff gets made in China, and so does junk. For the price point, VG-10 steel and quality so far, I'd have to say this is an excellent knife and not junk.Update Several months later: I can still shave with the blade. To be safe and remove any micro burrs, I dragged it through a ceramic v shaped sharpener for three passes, applying no pressure other than the weight of the knife. The blade is still scalpel sharp and glides through EVERYTHING. USE A WOODEN CUTTING BOARD! ANY blade will eventually suffer damage if it's slammed into a glass cutting board or countertop enough times. I didn't HAVE to use the ceramic either. Removing any micro abrasions from any blade helps them stay sharp, but not essential for this knife. It stayed razor sharp on it's own, so I take good care of it.The hamon line on the edge and damascus pattern in the blade are incredible! From one steel worker to another: great job! Worth EVERY PENNY!",5

Their combination of quality, versatility, and safety makes them a perfect addition to any kitchen. Highly recommended!",5
"Ultra sharp (cause it’s new) but I have high hopes. I particularly love the large handles for bigger hands. These kitchen shears cut through anything and at a reasonable price. The best park is since they are like regular scissors instead of that serrated crap, you can sharpen them if they get dull. I started using then to cut herbs and lettuces with great success and no bruising to delicate leaves. I highly recommend.",5
"These kitchen scissors have quickly become one of my most-used tools! They’re super sharp and make quick work of everything from cutting herbs to slicing through packaging with ease.

Very sharp and work well,5
"The KitchenAid All Purpose Kitchen Shears are an absolute must-have for every kitchen. These shears are incredibly, versatile and solidly built.

"I love these bags. They are sturdy and easy to open. I like the idea that there are 4 rolls in the box. White, no sent and very stretchy. Great price!",5
Great bang for your buck! I’ve been using this brand for years at home and my place of work. They’re amazing! Great quality!,5
These are the most durable and reliable trash bags. My husband and I have been ordering them for a few years now and will never use another trash bag. So great for the price and almost impossible to break.,5
"Good enough bags. I bought on sale thinking they are bags, kind of hard to screw up, and if they are bad well, they were cheap. This is good logic and I am glad we went with it. We have already purchased a second set. No leaking, no tearing. No regerts. They are bags and they work as advertised. Will likely continue to buy.",5
"We fill this with ice and the beverages of the event and set it on the counter.

Very happy with it.",5

These are great when entertaining and needing somewhere to keep your beverages cool.,5
The ice melted pretty fast but it didn't leak and it looks nice . Would buy again.,5
"I bought this to make a going away basket for a coworker. I was able to fit quite a bit of gifts! Although lightweight, it was very sturdy and did the job!",5
"Wishmaster, Nemo and Oceanborn all rate higher than a five so this just gets a five (let's farget about the horror tha was Century Child). It's a really powerful album although not as classic as the other albums, Tarja stull has a powerful voice especially in Elvenpath and Astral Romance. Get this album. Though if your a newbie then I recommend Wishmaster and Oceanborn first.",5
"first off i not a kid ect. This album is excellent, but the only thing I didnt like was the male vocals, but Tarja's voice is beautiful. Anway except for the male vocals, this was an amazing CD.",5
The Discs were in original unopened packaging and work perfectly. We love the series and enjoyed the extras at the end.,5
"to the reviewer whodat, the price for all the sets are the same. Amazon chose to only give a discount of 15% on this set as compared to 25% off on the first two.",5
"I first seen this movie when i was about 10 years old. It really freaked me out with its wierdness but years after, when i got to about 19 years old, i still couldnt get it out of my head. Then i started wondering if its out on DVD, to my surprise, it was! WOW! I thought i was the only one who really dig this film, slapstick humour, perfectly cast characters, some sexy, not to mention, psycho chicks & troma style gore! Even the main characters get in touch with thier darkside's! Its a classic & includes a lot of characters from the toxic avenger movies. Its a classic troma film, & a stand-alone awesome independant film aswell. If u aint seen a Troma film b4, definetly check it out. It bends hollywood rules & goes beyond them! Lloyd Kaufman's a genius! Its a low budget film but some of the special FX will amaze you....By the way, i havent even got the 1 with special features like deleted scenes & commentary, so even more reason to buy this, i am.",5
Class of Nuke Em'High is so awesomely bad!!! It is the best 'bad' movie I have ever seen! I have watched this movie over and over for more than 10 years... I know every word and every scene... I can also point out all the mess-up's!! I never get tired of seeing this film!!,5
"If you have seen the movies or know the story, the book is a completely different experiance! Beautiflly written and so much more than just a story about a man who doesn't age while the portrait does. Captivating and darkly thought provoking.. Great writting and facinating characters. Highly recommended!",5
I have watched the old movie of this story and the newer one but had never read the book. This was excellent!,5
"Classical, timeless and wonderfully written tale of that expands on the 'how evil corrupts your soul' theory.",5
"I listened to the audio version, which was a delight. This classic impresses upon the reader the importance of Christ's rhetorical question: what does it profit a man to gain the whole word but lose his soul? Wilde also underscores the point that true beauty resides in the eternal soul not the temporal body. This is a book to read and re-read.",5
"I was highly impressed by this novel of arts, society, morality and immortality. It has to be one of the most deepest things that I have ever read. One thing that bothered me a little was how Oscar Wilde went through this long winded prose and at times became a bit essay like but it had gave me food for thought.",5
"I haven't actually read the book yet, but dang does it look good on my shelf! Penguin clothbound is wonderful.",5
"Great book, very quick read and a must for anyone who really wants to understand the english cannon. I think I've seen 3 ""Twilight Zone"" episodes that feature the same plot though, kind of ruined the surprise halfway through...",5
I love this book! I completely think that I have fallen in love with the character Lord Henry. He is by far one of the wittiest characters that I have ever read in a book and trust me that I have read many books! I think that Oscar Wilde was a genius and this is one of the best literary works that he has written.It is a story of innocence lost and the quest of forever staying young.,5
"This is a beautiful book, full of vivid word pictures. Wilde is a genius of literature. Everyone should read this book",5
"The Picture of Dorian Gray is an amazing story told with such wonderful truth and cynicysim as only Wilde could tell it. Not only do I have much of the book highlighted, but it is worn from reading again and again. I would definitly reccomend this brilliant novel to anyone who wants to walk away with a feeling as if they've discovered a treasure they must share with the world.",5
This is a beautiful and witty tale about a depraved man. His ugly soul is mirrored by his ever-changing portrait while he retains his youthful visage. Suspenseful throughout. A classic.,5
This book is a facsinating read that blends insult and injury quite well. Fat and ugly people surely will be delighted or destroyed. Wittisms roar and pundits will roll in hedonism for the intelligentsia. A must-read for good-looking people and geniuses everywhere.,5
"After reading this story of a man who is so caught up in beauty that he ruins his life over it, I took the time to examine my own feelings on many things....Wilde has done it again in this one.I LOVED IT!!",5
"Still controversial today, Wilde's study of a man's moral distintigration is both richly poetic and ultimately disturbing. The book even resists classification today. Is it part of the Decadence movement or the Symbolist movement?Or is it an experimental novel, fashioned perhaps as a psychological gothic study? More importantly, though, Wilde's creation poses the question: Can a book be poisonous? Gray succumbs to the ""evil"" influence of Huysmans' book A Rebours. As Wilde as written, ""there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. Books are well written or badly written."" Wilde may have created a well written book, but he also, albeit purposely, created a book when, viewed from its many horizons, can be seen as terrible moral study in the lesson Gray undergoes.",5
I've only just started reading the book but so far I've enjoying what I've read of it to this point.,5
"I quite enjoyed the sharp witty dialogue,particularily that of Lord Henry who was one of the most interesting and provocative characters I've come across in quite some time.",5
"First of all, it is free and it is a classic you cannot miss. Short lecture with a great story",5
"This is a kick-ass rock group! I heard them on the AllGirlRadio station on the internet, and loved them!!! It's good to hear some good old rock, especially from women! Being a huge Joan Jett fan, I really appreciate this group!",5
"This band is simply awesome. The vocals are hard without being overbearing and the music demands respect. Each track is just as rockin' as the last, there are no dull moments here.",5
"This is a wonderful resource for clinician's, especially those that may NOT be used to working with TBI, right CVA and the higher level dysfunctions. It has exercises, compensatory strategies for both the patient, and suggestions for the patient. I've used it for years.",5
"Until Death Do Us Parta is the first book I've read from this author and it was GREAT. I recommend to everyone who like romance, suspense and mistery. This is not your run-of-the mill romance, suspense story !!This fantastic, suspense packed story is one that I will be keeping in my favorites file. These well described and highly developed characters have such an emotional bond between them that it brought tears to my eyes many times while reading this tale! Readers will not want to put this book down.This story for me was one that I didn't want to put down and when I absolutely had to, it kept calling my name until I could get back to it. GJT Simpson has got himself a new fan with this captivating and enchanting book and I can't wait to read what else he has in store!!! Outstanding! *****",5
We love it! We saw it last year at the camp ground. I got it for my B-day and enjoy the simple use and small size. When there is not fire pit or fires are not allowed that's the winner!,5
"It works great,the only thing Idon't like is the cheesy fake log, it would much better with the fake logs that come with gas fireplaces.",5
I used this book for a graduate class on public finance. The price was right and all the students had access to the electronic copy. The book content was very good for our purposes and allowed me to discuss the topics without the need for an overly expensive text book.,5
"i bought these socks at first because they looked funny and was curious so i thought i would give it a try. It did take some time to get used to having my toes being separated, but after a while, i don't even want to take them off. It did get kind of embarrassing when i take my shoes off in front of people though. but overall, i do like these socks.",5
At first the socks feel a bit constricting but after 5 minutes you can't feel them at all. I just ran 5 miles and had no blisters or sore toes for the first time. I am buying two more pairs now :),5
"I wear these with my vibrams and love them - have never gotten a blister. I've also used them in a bunch of races, as much as 100 miles, and had great luck. However, if you're doing a race that's going to be really wet or have stream crossings, I would recommend getting one of the higher cut ones since the lowest cut one can fall down when it gets really wet, which is annoying and makes heel blisters more likely.",5
"I have only had these for a short time, but after a few hours of wearing them to get used to the extra material, I am really enjoying them. I use these socks not only when running, but for basketball and tennis too. Works great so far, and I am going to buy more of them.",5
"I wear these type socks and footlets for relief from one toe that has started going under the toe next to it. On my feet for hours and it gets painful. These are well made, keep toes straight (like when I was younger) and keep me going painfree. I wish this company made this style, little footlets that don't show with dress shoes.",5
"injinji Micro Toesocks are very well made. The material seems to very comfortable. They stay in place, without slipping down in my shoes",5
"I bought these socks for my Five Fingers, but ended up running a marathon in them. I was having bad blisters on the tops of my second and third toes after long runs (15+ miles) and gave them a shot. For the marathon, I also sprayed some second skin (I forget the brand) but afterwards I had no blisters anywhere. Very happy with these socks. (As an aside, I also own the lightweight version of these. Great for Five Fingers, too loose for regular shoes.)",5
"At first I hated these socks because I never wore toe socks and the only reason I bought them is because I bought me a pair of vibram toe shoes. After awhile I got use to it being between my toes and now I love them and are by far the most comfy socks, while second best. Asics are the best but these are better than any Nike socks.",5
"These socks were for my son, who runs lots of races. He was getting blisters on his toes, but with these socks, no more blisters. He wears them under high quality running shoes, and under minimalist shoes. He's very happy with the socks.",5
These socks are great. I bought them to wear with my Vibram Five Fingers. They are soft and fit nice and snug and don't bunch up and the heel doesn't ride down as I run. Great find!,5
"I bought these socks on a whim because I just purchased a pair of Vibram FiveFinger Bikila LS toe shoes. Love the shoes, but I am not wearing these socks with them because the shoes are skin tight without the socks. I have ended up wearing my injinji's with every other pair of shoes I own. I currently have 3 pairs of these socks and will be purchasing more very soon. I will never wear a regular pair of socks again. I am officially a toe-sock convert. They allow a greater range of motion and completely eliminate toe bunching caused by socks.",5
"Great toe socks, my sisters bf loves them. He wears them all the time with his toe shoes, and they are super soft.",5
"Finally some toe socks for guys withh big feet. These are wonderful and comfortable, will be getting more of these.",5
"very good product, excellent time and attention me dieron respuestas a mis preguntas and get my order in the time ordered",5
Item was Shipped fast and it was exactly what I expected and my son loved the socks thank you very much!,5
"I absolutely love these socks, they are the most comfortable socks I've ever worn in boots or cross trainers. I need about 10 more pair.",5
If you own Vibrams these are a must. Vibram sold toesocks are over priced. Injinji makes microfiber in all sizes compatible with Vibram socks and are more affordable. Especially since my Vibrams with shipping took me over 100 bones.-Sgt of Marines,5
"I have had a pair of vibram five fingers KSO treks for about two months. I love the shoes which recently started causing blisters in certain areas. I broke down and started buying these socks which have not disappointed. They have eliminated the foot odor in these leather shoes as well as provided a comfortable snug fit for me. Granted, all feet are different and I tend to have some long skinny toes. These stretched to fit comfortably. They seem to be made of quality material.I would not run around sock-footed in these since carpet will ultimately wear holes in them. So far I have machine washed them multiple times and they have retained their shape without stretching. These socks are great to use even if you do not have a pair of vibrams. They work well in regular shoes. I have even worn them in insulated boots.",5
"I bought these socks to wear with the Merrell barefoot model shoes and it was very conclusive. The toes feel great separated like this, it's a bit like not having socks at all. I was afraid to be cold but after walking for a while my feet were hot and at ease.",5
This DVD is for those of us who are not young gym bunnies. It's a good way to ease into yoga.,5
Got to me quick and timely. Used them to mount a 130/90-18 on a spoked rim with inner tube. Never came close to biting the tube. Enough length for leverage if you take small bites. Nice size to carry.,5
"first off, i love trains, the sound of rumbling trains in the night, anything to do with trains. ive always loved the idea of hopping freight trains. there aren't very many books on the subject. ive read hopping freight trains in america which is a great manual if you are planing on taking a ride. this book gave an inside view on what its like to live the tramp life. after reading this it made me want to ride the rails even more. great book.",5
"OK...here's the drill...a lot of semi-pro or pro musicians cringe at the thought of putting a Digitech ""anything"" in their signal chain. But recently, I went to a local venue, and heard this guy playing super transpearent lead guitar lines, while maintaing the sound of his single coil insturment, but it sounded like tubes being overdriven, all from a 15 watt amp. I snuck a peak at his modest pedal board....and there was a Badmonkey!This pedal took the place of a handmade pedal on my board that was 5 times the cost! YouTube has some great vid reviews. But this will be the best $49 you'll spend on a pedal desinged to maintain the integrity of you guitars unique sound, yet give you enough dirt/grind to feel like you're playing through a Narrow Panel Tweed at 10. This is NOT for Metal Heads...this is strictly old school, blues, country or jazz/fusion only. Combine it with a ZD or TS, and it's magic on a budget!DigiTech DBM Bad Monkey Overdrive Guitar Effects Pedal",5
"If you've ever even THOUGHT about going to work for the U.S. Government, BUY THIS BOOK!! Full of useful information that federal job hunters MUST have to succeed.",5
Louis Begley is able to convincingly write of survival as seen through the innocence and straightforwardness of a young Jewish boy. A boy whose life gradually becomes a web of lies and inward and outward loss. Loss which he will ultimately not be able to ever recover from. This is a short book with appeal to adults and young adults given the young protagonist and appropriate content.,5
"The best part for me is Part three of the book, it presents a realistic implementation of Battleship game using client server, it covers all the interesting aspects in a very clear and incremental manner.Chapter 18 is paricularly good, it starts from a very simple active object, explains how it works, then moves on to the pattern, also explains why he favors one approach over the other, the mistake he made etc.Part Three - Communications and Systems ProgrammingChapter 16 - Communications and Systems ProgrammingChapter 17 - The Transaction-oriented Games StackChapter 18 - Active ObjectsChapter 19 - Client-server FrameworkChapter 20 - The GSDP ServerChapter 21 - GDP ImplementationsChapter 22 - Full Battleships",5
The Eyewitness DK guides are beautiful books in their own right--you would enjoy reading them even if you didn't make the trip. The text is well organized and extensively illustrated with artwork and 3-D pictures of the major tourist attractions. The directions are excellent and they direct you to the important things to see at each location.A particularly helpful feature is a section with specific instructions on how to use Vienna's extensive public transportation system including a description of the various types of tickets and pictures of the ticket machines.This guide blows the competition out of the water.,5
"Alot of times i will have trouble getting into racing games due to 1 or 2 small things that make the game a drag... but this one i have beaten 3 times and still enjoy playiong it!!!!The Cars are excellent (i love the hearse), Physics and Damage are amazingly realistic.... very cool unlockable Videos. Tons of diffrent race modes, and a Very good soundtrack!!!The ONLY thing that i think is a little dissappointing is the fact that SOME of the event types are not playable in the Carreer mode (out of about 25 diffrent styles of events..only about 3 are NOT in the Career mode).I recomend you pick up this game.. if you like racing, and like Demolition derby style play... You will love this game Beyond words!!!!",5
it has demolition derby figure 8 trailer races oh lord when i buy this game im afraid to ask what other crazy events await me in this chaos and mayhem game,5
"This was one of the best mysteries I've listened to in a long time--I had the audio version which was well read. I liked the unexpected twists, and every time I thought I had it figures out, another twist would send me down a different path. Well done. I'm looking forward to more stories by this author!",5
this is such a great movie.. loved it.. would of seen it over and over in the theater if the prices werent so high... definatly a buyer..,5
I downloaded it on to my kindle and I enjoyed watching it instantly. No problems purchasing or downloading it. Amazon made it easy for me to purchase things like this movie for my kindle.,5
This movie was very good and the whole family enjoyed it.We can't wait for part 2.I would recommend this movie.,5
"This is by far the best movie of the series and for a first for me, my new very favorite movie. This movie stayed closer to the book then the others and I thought it was great!!Besides the actors, which I adore, the makeup artist was phenomenal!!Billy Burke is heavily under-rated; he was great!!The setting and backdrop was fantastic!!I think Bill Condon will be in very high demand because of his ability to stay true to the writer's work and give it wonderful vision. Very few other directors have this gift.If you have read and enjoyed the books, this movie will ring truer for you than the others.But I still like them too.",5
I have been trying to find somewhere to get Breaking dawn for a wonderful price. Finally after looking I found this one and I love it. It was in great shape. The shipping was fast as well.,5
"The movie was very close to the book, in the sense that the wedding, honeymoon, and birth were captured with a variety of emotions that the people watching the movie could feel those emotions. Also, the soundtrack was spectacular, in the honeymoon they used Turning Page by Sleeping At Last that if you read the lyrics you will be captivated even if you don't believe in true love.",5
I loved it and am really glad to add it my collection.I ordered another copy and will give it to myGreat grandaughter in college.,5
My granddaughter loves all things to do with the Twilight series. She said this movie is awesome and would highly recommend it.,5
"I love the series! They are great movies, I have watched them over and over again. Well worth buying them!",5
"Breaking Dawn is a story of two teens gradually growing and facing adult choices, decisions and consequences. Edward and Bella wed, and the adventure ends at a point midway in the book, at the moment she wakes as a vampire. Keep watching. There is a little bit more to the story.",5
"it was great to watch again, I remember watching it afew years ago and it's still as great as ever. I would recommend it to anyone to buy.",5
"You either like the movies or you don't. Of course, I do so I am very please with the product and the customer service.",5
It was in great conditions and it came very fast even a while month before Christmas.Very pleased with it.,5
Anyone who likes the Twilight Saga will like this one. It was beautifully portraid in movie form. And the ending was great!,5
"I am, as usual, very pleased with my order. It was delivered in a timely manner and in in excellent condition. If you like the serious I would recommend adding this one to your collection.",5
This movie was great I am a huge fan of The Twilight Saga and have watched this several times and can't wait for part 2.,5
"In the first place, this item was well packaged. It arrived on time and was in great condition.As far as the item itself is concerned, I love it! I made the mistake of reading the first book since one of my vices is vampire lore. The books were so well written, that I ended up viewing and later purchasing the DVDs in relation to each one. However, the books are still better because they provide a much richer story.",5
"Okay this has got to be the best movie in the twilight saga and it is far the best. The action is the greatest,It's great to see that Bella and Edward finally get married but theirs only one problem Bella gets pregnant and now she will have to make a life decision of what shes going to do because she has a lot to go through, Will she die or will she stay alive. This is the best movie from the twilight saga and it deserves five star's. I can't wait for Part 2 which will be coming out next November, But for now this is the best movie so far in the twilight saga =)",5
LOVE IT. TELL EVERYONE TO SEE IT I WATCH.I WATCH THIS MOVIE OVER AND OVER AGIGN THATS HOW MUCH I LOVE IT,5
"I now have all but the last movie in the series, and love this movie series, so I'm not complaining at all.",5
"While the first 3 Movies stayed somewhat close to the books, ""Breaking Dawn-Part 1"", has a lot of thing's that are different in it... I know that they can't put EVERYTHING from the book into the movie, but there were a few time's that I found myself thinking 'Why did theydo this/that???', 'How did they get from there to here???'Even with those thing's, it's still a GREAT Movie... One that you diffently want to see... I just hope they release it on DVD soon... I also can't wait to see -Part 2-, I think it's going to be sometime in July or around then...",5
My now 13 year old daughter loves it and it was just what she wanted to make her collection as complete as possible.,5
This is a part of the same movies my son wanted. Now all he needs is breaking dawn 2 he can't wait for it.Thank you so much.,5
This was gift to my daughter for Christmas. She was so excited to have received it. She is a huge Twilight fan. She loved it!!!,5
I am fan. Love Vampire movies anyway. creating a love story of such between a vampire and human and then to produce a child was great. again I loved it.,5
"I'm old enough to be all the actors mother, but still find the whole Twilight Saga charming. The acting is very good and Rob Pattenson is his usual sexy self, this is the first time he has to struggle at something without Bella at his side, but all works out well. If you love the other movies, you'll love this one too. The only thing was there were only a couple bruises, what's the big deal? For him to be so upset they could've marked her up a little more. The sex scenes were sweet and tastefully done, love it when he moans! But why did the other vampires stop hunting when she comes home pregnant? Just remember its a modern fairy tale and go with the flow and you'll enjoy this movie too.",5
My collection is almost complete. It was very hard finding the right dvd version that is similar to borders' twilight and new moon. It is what I thought it was. And what I wanted.,5
"Love this movie. My daughter got me watching them and I was hooked. Even if you didn't read the books, you can still enjoy the movies.",5
"Loved this movie!! The Twilight movies just progressively get better, and I live having the double DVD with all the special features!",5
"This was my favorite Twilight movie so far. I've got to say, I was a little nervous about this one. With a wedding, honeymoon, and a baby, I didn't think they would be able to fit all of that in a two hour movie. I am completely Team Jacob(Taylor Lautner) but, I also found myself liking Edward (Robert Patterson)in this one. I always thought he was cold-hearted. He showed emotion and he had a personally in this movie. I never saw that before. He was also a good husband. Not to big on having a baby, but he had good reasons. He came around in the end when he knew the baby wasn't a demon, and that's all that matters. It is rated PG13 and comes with Special Features.",5
"This movie is one of the best I have seen! When I went to the theater I was so excited. When I came out I was looking through every store to pre-order it. I would suggest this movie if you like Romance and Drama, and Baby Renesme. It was Ah-Mazing!!!!",5
I've never read the books so I wasn't a big fan going into Twilight but the movie did a great job of engaging you and anxious to see Part 2. Great bonus features too on the making of the movie. I would recommend buying it.,5
Love Twilight. Any gift I receive that is Twilight related is a winner in my book. Huge Fan! ! !,5
Awesome movie and at a great price of only .99. Thank you for the opportunity to rent the movie. now i am caught up on the series.,5
My daughters are hooked on the twilight series and love this DVD. It is awesome and in great codition. Thanks,5
Excellent. I have the complete series and this is an excellent movie. I thought it was neat it was filmed in Washington.,5
"By far this was the best Twilight movie. I loved it! I saw it twice. It was funny, sad and exciting. I believe it was true to the book. I would even have to go as far as to say it was better than the book. I thought the sex scene would be horrible because it was PG-13 ( and I am 34) but they did a great job at capturing what needed to be captured and did it in a tasteful way. Pattinson is adorable! Stewart did an outstanding job! I cant wait to get my DVD copy!",5
I bought this one to help complete my collection and to watch all of them prior to the release of the last movie in theatres. Love this series.,5
"I cannot wait for this to come out. I have all of the other movies and books. Also went to see them all in theaters. My fav movie was the first Twilight, but this one is close second. I don't see how their gonnna fit the rest of Breaking Dawn into one movie. But I can't wait to see!",5
"Saw the movie in the theater, but wanted the DVD to watch from time to time. Wife loves the music and got me hooked.",5
